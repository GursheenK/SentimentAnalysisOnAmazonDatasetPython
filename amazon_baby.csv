Planetwise Flannel Wipes,"These flannel wipes are OK, but in my opinion not worth keeping.  I also ordered someImse Vimse Cloth Wipes-Ocean Blue-12 countwhich are larger, had a nicer, softer texture and just seemed higher quality.  I use cloth wipes for hands and faces and have been usingThirsties 6 Pack Fab Wipes, Boyfor about 8 months now and need to replace them because they are starting to get rough and have had stink issues for a while that stripping no longer handles.",3
Planetwise Wipe Pouch,it came early and was not disappointed. i love planet wise bags and now my wipe holder. it keps my osocozy wipes moist and does not leak. highly recommend it.,5
Annas Dream Full Quilt with 2 Shams,Very soft and comfortable and warmer than it looks...fit the full size bed perfectly...would recommend to anyone looking for this type of quilt,5
Stop Pacifier Sucking without tears with Thumbuddy To Love's Binky Fairy Puppet and Adorable Book,"This is a product well worth the purchase.  I have not found anything else like this, and it is a positive, ingenious approach to losing the binky.  What I love most about this product is how much ownership my daughter has in getting rid of the binky.  She is so proud of herself, and loves her little fairy.  I love the artwork, the chart in the back, and the clever approach of this tool.",5
Stop Pacifier Sucking without tears with Thumbuddy To Love's Binky Fairy Puppet and Adorable Book,"All of my kids have cried non-stop when I tried to ween them off their pacifier, until I found Thumbuddy To Love's Binky Fairy Puppet.  It is an easy way to work with your kids to allow them to understand where their pacifier is going and help them part from it.This is a must buy book, and a great gift for expecting parents!!  You will save them soo many headaches.Thanks for this book!  You all rock!!",5
Stop Pacifier Sucking without tears with Thumbuddy To Love's Binky Fairy Puppet and Adorable Book,"When the Binky Fairy came to our house, we didn't have any special gift and book to help explain to her about how important it is to stop using a pacifier. This book does a great job to help prepare your child for the loss of their favorite item. The doll is adorable and we made lots of cute movies with the Binky Fairy telling our daughter about what happens when the Binky Fairy comes. I would highly recommend this product for any parent trying to break the pacifier or thumb sucking habit.",5
A Tale of Baby's Days with Peter Rabbit,"Lovely book, it's bound tightly so you may not be able to add alot of photos/cards aside from the designated spaces in the book. Shop around before you purchase, as it is currently listed at Barnes & Noble for 29.95!",4
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","Perfect for new parents. We were able to keep track of baby's feeding, sleep and diaper change schedule for the first two and a half months of her life. Made life easier when the doctor would ask questions about habits because we had it all right there!",5
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","A friend of mine pinned this product on Pinterest so I decided to give it a whirl! It is fantastic! If you are a new parent, this will help you keep track of feedings, diaper changes and the like!",5
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log",This has been an easy way for my nanny to record all the key events that happen with my baby when I'm not at home.  Would highly recommend it to someone who wants to stay informed of what your baby is up to while you're not home.The only reason this isn't a 5 is because I think there could have been some more standarad pre-printed options.I plan on ordering another one when we run out of pages in this journal.,4
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","I love this journal and our nanny uses it everyday to track on our daughter's sleep, eating and other activities. The layout and design make it very easy to fill in quickly with a comments column to add in details (i.e. we ask the nanny to specify what food she had for lunch, amount of milk she took, specifics of play time--tummy time, walk to park, etc.) I love knowing the details of my baby's day, and I also use it to track weekly on overall schedule patterns and changes (i.e. baby's nap time has moved naturally as she gets older).My only complaint is that there is no real space to communicate back to the nanny, as I sometimes want to reply to the nanny's comments and/or leave her notes about the previous night (i.e. Baby didn't sleep well or baby has rash, etc) or other instructions (Please use sun screen on the baby - it's hot out today) that I often forget to tell her in the rush of the morning. I just stick in post-its now for my notes. All in all, I highly recommend this baby tracker.",4
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","This book is perfect!  I'm a first time new mom, and this book made it so easy to keep track of feedings, diaper changes, sleep.  Definitely would recommend this for new moms.  Plus it's small enough that I throw in the diaper back for doctor visits.",5
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","I originally just gave the nanny a pad of paper to write down this information for my little one. She would take him to the park and leave the pad behind - I was getting incomplete/inaccurate information when she wohld get home at the end of the day and try to remember naps/feedings/diaper changes. I wanted something she could take with her and also a way to better control how she reported information. This was the perfect solution! Now I'm getting all the information I wanted. There is a very helpful example of how to fill it out. It also has a pouch for additional documents and a section up front for emergency contact info. Each page goes from 7 - 6. This works for me because the nanny starts at 7am and ends before 6pm. I use an app on my phone for tracking when I'm with the baby. I transfer the info from this notebook to my phone. My only complaint: the space is pretty small - they provide useful shorthand, but it's a little difficult to fit some of the info in the space provided. Also, some of the other reviews complain about the 7 - 6 time format. This isn't a real problem for me, but I suppose if you wanted to track an entire day, you would have to use two pages - not too big of a deal. 7am - 6pm is pretty much perfect for daycare/nanny/caregiver situation.",4
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","I thought keeping a simple handwritten journal would be nice.  But I haven't used this thing at all, and here's why:1.) When you're breastfeeding, it's often nice to have your phone close by so that you can keep yourself entertained.  If you are able to grab *both* your phone and this notebook - and a pen - consistently - and at 3 in the morning - you are more skilled than me.  (I don't nurse in the same place every time.)2.) You're also often so sleep deprived that - at least for me - I'd forget to look at what time we started on a side, or what side we started on.  I'm not perfect with the app I have either, but at least I just have to mindlessly hit a button.3.) I really like the app I have (Baby Connect).  It gives me better data.  For example, it can tell me how long on average feedings have been taking (helpful as we start to think about sleep training).  It can tell me that I nursed him 177 times last month (granted that serves no useful purpose other than a feeling of perverse satisfaction).",3
Nature's Lullabies First Year Sticker Calendar,"Space for monthly photos, info and a lot of useful stickers come with it. It is exactly what I wanted!!",5
Nature's Lullabies First Year Sticker Calendar,"I bought this calender for myself for my second son. It is very colorful and has room on each page to write height, weight, and what baby likes to do. There is also room on each page for a photo to be placed. The calender date boxes have room for a sticker and some fine writing. My only complaint is that it does not have as many stickers as I would like, but I just put asterisks before whatever special event happened that day. I bought one for a friend as she found it very useful as well.",4
Nature's Lullabies First Year Sticker Calendar,"I love this little calender, you can keep track of all of baby's firsts. I like the illustrations, and the stickers too.",5
Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,This was the only calender I could find for the second year. I did one for the first and wanted to continue cause there are so many things to note still after they turn 1. This one was better than the first year one I got him.,5
Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,I completed a calendar for my son's first year and really enjoyed tracking all of his milestones and special moments - so much so that I wanted to continue in the second year since he's still doing amazing and fun things every day.  I really like the simple layout of the calendar and while it might not have all the questions and milestone stickers you want - at least it's something to keep recording all those special moments!,4
Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,We wanted to get something to keep track of our child's milestones and this is a cute option. There aren't many other choices out there and this does exactly what we wanted.,5
Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,"I had a hard time finding a second year calendar, this is the only one I came across and it is great!  Large enough to write in the squares and has a spot to put that month's picture in as well as some memories. The first two years they change so much I like to jot everything down so I can keep track of all the big milestones...and little ones!  I find it is easier to do this on a calendar vs a baby book.  This way you can fill out the baby book later and have a great reference to do so!",5
Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,"I only purchased a second-year calendar for my son because I had one for my daughter. I was really disappointed with the lack of selection available for second-year calendars in general, so I just got this one because it was one of the only ones. It's an okay calendar. The finish on the pages is glossy which makes it hard to write on with certain pens. The stickers aren't very cute and the pages are pretty old-fashioned looking. Hopefully they will come out with some other calendars for future purchasers.",2
Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,I LOVE this calendar for recording events of my son's second year of life.  There are plenty of 1st year baby calendars out there and I loved reocording events of his first year and didn't want to just stop now that he is one.  Nature's lullabies second year calendar is perfect for continuing on with daily record keeping.  The stickers are wonderful and helped me think of milestones to record that I might not have thought of on my own.  I highly recommend this calendar!  Plus it's super cute and brat for either gender.,5
Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,"Calendar is exactly as described, but I find the look of it to be very cheap.  There are lots of nice stickers to use.  I was just disappointed it looks so cheap.",3
Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,"Wife loves this calender. Comes with a lot of stickers and options to mark the firsts. Includes spaces for milestone photos as well. Sticker borders for photos, etc, it is just a very easy to use scrap booking option. Especially for new moms who dont have enough time to actually sit down, and haul out a ton of scrapbook supplies",5
Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,My daughter had her 1st baby over a year ago. She did receive and fill up a First Year Calendar. When her son was nearing his first birthday she was looking for a Second Year Calendar to record his milestones. Thanks to Amazon I was able to get this for her and she LOVES it. Tender sweet art work - helpful stickers - unique pages to fill. A nice keepsake. A wonderful gift for a one-year old!,5
Baby's First Journal - Green,"Extremely useful! As a new mom, tired and inexpedient, not remembering how long ago baby ate, this definitely helped me through the first two months.",5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",My son loves peek a boo at this age of 9 months so I thought this book would be perfect! This book doesn't engage him enough though it seems.  He does however like the cover the most if I make pretend blow-kisses and peekaboo gestures with the hands and show him. He also likes when I fan the hair towards his face.Maybe when he's older he will flip the flaps but right now he just likes the mirror at the end and the front cover. If I flip the book through he just takes the book and shakes it around.,3
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","One of baby's first and favorite books, and it is washable! I gave 1 less star than perfect because I'd like to see some diversity in the people - not just your typical white family ;)",4
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",I like how the book has a hook to attach it to your stroller or car seat - it wont get lost.  Great way to go over family members.,5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",Beautiful little book.  A great little short story saying I Love You....Keeps the attention of the baby and then the baby can actually turn the pages and hold on to it when you are finished interacting with it.,5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",This book is so worth the money. It says 9+ months on the box but I can't wait for my baby to be born to try to use it before. It's so cute and very interactive! There are flaps to open on every page.,5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","we just got this book for our one-year-old and she loves it.  It's so nice that she can't bite chunks out of it like she can a board book or rip it like a paper one.  She can chew on it, pull on it, and carry it all over the house!  She loves the little flaps that open and is learning simple words like ""daddy,"" ""mommy,"" ""puppy,"" etc.  We love it.",5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",The book is colorful and is perfect for 6months and older. The only thing I didn't like was the strong smell of the dyes and/or material. I dunked the pages in detergent. Then let the book dry overnight.,4
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","The book is cute, and we are huge fans of Lamaze products, however, this one leaves out some family members (no little brother) and can possibly cause hurt feelings. That said, our baby loves to play with the hands, hair and flaps!",3
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",What a great book for babies!  I'd been looking for books which couldn't be damaged by my 10-month old's drool...so cloth or plastic books were my options.  This book adds another level to your usual cloth book--a fun flap or moving part on every page.  This interactive book is perfect for my baby!,5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","My son loved this book as an infant.  It was perfect because he would chew on his board books and destroy them, but this one we didn't have that issue.  I love the Lamaze series, they are a lot of fun not only for the child but for the parent.I liked that this book was not only teaching my son about Peek a Boo, but we used it to learn names for family members like grandparents, sister, cat, dog etc.  And of course with it being a lift the flap book, that was additional fun for my son as well.  He's nearly two now and he doesn't look at it as much, but he still does enjoy reading it and playing with it now and again.  I'd say out of all the Lamaze books, this one and Discovery Farm are his favorites.",5
"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","Our baby loves this book & has loved it for a while now ... He enjoys when I read it to him, and enjoys playing with it on his own.",5
SoftPlay Twinkle Twinkle Elmo A Bedtime Book,,5
SoftPlay Twinkle Twinkle Elmo A Bedtime Book,My son likes brushing elmo's teeth. Almost too nice of a book to let the kids play with haha :),5
SoftPlay Twinkle Twinkle Elmo A Bedtime Book,This was a birthday present for my 2 year old grandchildren.  They love this book and will sit and go through it page by page themselves .  The pictures are imaginative and appeal to young children.  Would buy it again!,5
"SoftPlay Giggle Jiggle Funbook, Happy Bear","This bear is absolutely adorable and I would give it a 5 star rating if it actually giggled or growled like it was suppose to!  I just got it in the mail the other day and was super excited when I saw how cute it was!  If it's something as simple as a dead battery I could handle it BUT I can't even find a place where the batteries would to!  Such a disappointment....it's going back and I have no gift to take down to my new Granddaughter, Kenzie, now!",2
SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where's Elmo A Children's Book,"My baby absolutely loves Elmo and so this book seemed perfect for her.  I'm happy to say I was right:  this book is nice and soft and beautifully illustrated so my little one takes it everywhere and ""reads"" it all of the time. While Elmo is the main character of because he hides on each page, other Sesame Street characters are also featured which is fun, too. Another great, interactive, Elmo centric book that I would recommend for the Sesame Street/Elmo lovers is ""Twinkle, Twinkle Elmo"" (which is also available on Amazon for a great price).",5
SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where's Elmo A Children's Book,"I bought two for recent baby showers!  The book is soft and interactive, great for any baby, and the bright colors are beautiful.  Lastly, who doesn't love Elmo!",5
SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where's Elmo A Children's Book,"We wanted to get another book like the Big Birds Friends softplay book, and we only found the two Elmo books. This one is fun, but the Big Bird book has more variety and is more creative.",4
SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where's Elmo A Children's Book,This is a cute little peek-a-boo story book.  It's soft.  It's safe.  And it is easy for baby to handle.,4
SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where's Elmo A Children's Book,"My 3 month old son loves this book. We read it over and over and he smiles and laughs every time we find Elmo and say &#34;peekaboo Elmo!&#34;  We have a few different soft books and this is the most colorful and fun to read. And baby adores it, so 5 stars for sure.",5
SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where's Elmo A Children's Book,Very cute interactive book! My son loves this book! The bright colorful illustrations make this great for babies & toddlers.,5
"SoftPlay 4 Pack Block Book, Sweet Sesame","Bought for granddauchildren and they play with them all the time.  Love reading to them.  Soft, so if they fall on them, they are safe. When they use the Elmo book, the kiss Elmo.  Got when they were 9 mos, now they are two and we are still having fun with them.  They love to see how high they can stack the blocks before it falls over.  I buy as a baby present.",5
"SoftPlay 4 Pack Block Book, Sweet Sesame","I have teething babies and these were great for entertaining the, and letting them chew and droll all over the, without worrying about ruining them. They were great for setting them off to their side to encourage rolling over and crawling. Great Christmas gift for the younger baby and didn't break the bank.",4
"SoftPlay Cloth Book, Love",This book is boring. Nothing to stimulate my granddaughter. It is a waste of money. I would not recommend it,1
SoftPlay Baby's First Cloth Books Gift Set,"It is so hard to find cloth books with ACTUAL images on them! So many have unrealistic portrayals of what animals/objects look like, but this one is fantastic. EXACTLY what we were looking for!!When we teach our 1 year old what a ""lion"" is, we want to show him a REAL lion... not a drawing that looks nothing like a real lion.",5
"SoftPlay Cloth Book, Hugs","for the young child, very cute...so happy they can &#34; read&#34; something there is little or no chance of them destroying..many happy reading memories",5
SoftPlay Baby Animals of the World Soft Cloth Book,"not bad but not as interesting to my 1-year old as I thought. Mot interactive [texture, etc] but cute anyway",3

Baby's First Year Undated Wall Calendar with Stickers to Mark &quot;Firsts&quot; - Pink,I searched high and low for a first year calendar and settled on this one based on the reviews.  I am so happy that I did.  Perfect for jotting down quick memories throughout the month and remembering dates of baby's &#34;firsts&#34;.  Will be fun to look back on.  Also has spots for personalization and pictures.,5
Baby's First Year Undated Wall Calendar with Stickers to Mark &quot;Firsts&quot; - Pink,This is a very good gift for a new mother.  You would want to give it to the parents as soon as baby is born so that they can start from the very beginning to chart the &#34;firsts&#34;.  I had one of these calendars for each of my five children.  They enjoy looking up their &#34;firsts&#34; especially as they are now parents themselves.,5
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,,5
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,Absolutely love it and all of the Scripture in it.  I purchased the Baby Boy version for my grandson when he was born and my daughter-in-law was thrilled to receive the same book again.,5
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,Bought as a gift for my daughter in law. She loved it. Simple but a place to put important memories down. I loved the verses at bottom of pages.,4
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,"I didn't realize this was a religious product, so I almost returned it.  (Not that I have anything against that, but some of the pages ask for favorite scripture, prayers for the baby, etc.). Wasn't sure that fir with out lifestyle, but the book has all the right ages for memories, so we are keeping it.",3
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,OMG.....we loved this baby book! Perfect for the memories you want to remember when your little one gets bigger and starts asking questions. It even had a place for foot and hand prints for when your baby is born which is the main reason why we liked this one. Also it has pockets for keepsakes and little places to put first locks of hair....etc! So cute and is a great baby shower gift!,5
Our Baby Girl Memory Book,"Beautiful book, I love it to record cherished times in my great granddaughters life with the beautiful pastel pink color.",5

My Kindergarten Year - A Keepsake Book,"I was pleasantly surprised upon receiving the memory book entitled,  ""My Kindergarten Year"". It is the perfect way to record one's Kindergarten experience through photographs and detailed descriptions of this very important time in your child's life. The questions are fun for your child to answer and record while serving its purpose for the parent.I'd recommend this book to everyone with a Kindergartener.",5
My Kindergarten Year - A Keepsake Book,I'm so glad I stumbled upon these gem. My son has already started answering questions and I think it will be a great memory to look back years later to see how he answered the questions.,5
Jellycat Elephant and Mouse Book,The book is just a few pages long with a few words to each page.  Just short enough to keep the attention of my 6 month old son.  We have the Elephant as well so when he's older it will be neat to see the realization of the association between the stuffed toy and the book character,4
God Created Everything Nite Lite,"This is well made a very pretty,.  It gives a nice light and will be used for years...I recommend it highly.  It also makes a great gift.",5

Wall Decor Removable Decal Sticker - Colorful Butterflies,Would not purchase again or recommend. The decals were thick almost plastic like and were coming off the wall as I was applying them! The would NOT stick! Literally stayed stuck for about 5 minutes then started peeling off.,2
Modern House Winnie the Pooh Swing and Tiger Swing (2 pages) removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,I could not get these Winnie the Pooh themed wall decor stickers in New Zealand and these were a very cost effective option that I was very impressed with.  They were easy to stick on and look fantastic on the wall - they don't &#34;look&#34; like stickers at all.  Very professional and very seamless on the paintwork.,5

Reusable Flannel (15) Baby Wipes 100% Cotton Bleached and Unbleached (Flushable Diaper Liners),I love these wipes.  They are so simple and soft and they are a great price for reusable wipes.  They actually get my baby clean and dry during diaper changes.  And I know that I'll find a million other uses for them after our diaper days are done.  I'm ordering more of them right now!,5
Beautiful Girl and Black Flower Removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,"It is nice and looks great on my wall. It was just a bit smaller than what I thought, but that was my fault and not taking the measurements.",4
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),We bought the pins as my 6 year old Autistic son was able to open or break open normal safety pins we needed to use for his night time clothes.  These new pins are significantly more sturdy and he hasn't learned how to open them and only once has he broken one open.  I seem to recall that their shipping price was more than a bit on the high side of reasonable though given the size of the package...,4
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),These were  good quality--worked fine--heavy duty--able to be used in any way needed and filled my need as no others,2
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),A great safety pin that has lots of uses.  Easy to find with bright colors and a great bargain for a dozen.,5
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"While the diaper pins are attractive, the metal in the pins I received are flimsy and did not hold up to the thick fabric I used them on. Fortunately there was no baby involved, so no little on was stuck.",2
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"These diaper pins went to Honduras to hold the cloth diapers we also sent with the missionaries. It is difficult to find diaper pins in our &#34;disposable&#34; age. In Honduras, they do not have &#34;Pampers&#34;. They appreciated the kits we sent.",5
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"It has been many years since we needed diaper pins, but I do like to pin my socks together through the wash and have never lost one yet. I was using brass dressmaker pins but they tended to open up during the wash cycle. My wife suggested diaper pins and we tried them. Thery're working perfectly and staying together through the washing. Matter of fact they can get a little tricky to open, but of course that was the idea. Recommended to keep your socks &#34;friended up&#34;.",5
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"As another reviewer noted, these are great for matching socks before washing.  Now once the socks come out of the washer, I hang them to dry with the pins still on.  The socks stay on the line to dry without clothespins, they just hang with one sock on each side of the line.  After they are dried, I just open the pin and leave it by the hamper on a shelf.  As I put dirty socks into the hamper, I grab a pin and use it.  Has saved a lot of time and I don't have the problem of lost socks or mismatched socks on my feet.  Great idea and am glad I read about this here on the reviews.  Wish I had done this my whole life.",5
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"The steel part is not strong at all, unlike the old diaper pins, which I still have.  Very hard to work it through a thicker fabric.  Would not recommend.",1
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),I really thought I was getting a dozen pins..turns out I should have counted the pins in the picture..as there are only 10. I am sad..and I think that they are overpriced. I only use them to mark yarn when I crochet so I will be going back to regular safety pins.,2
Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"Like = sharp ends that pierce through my diapers easier.  Dislike = the sides bend which is a pain.  That said, I am pushing them through older velcro tabs because the velcro on my diapers doesn't work anymore.",4

Wall-stickers Wall Decor Removable Decal Sticker - Giant Cherry Blossom Tree in Wind,I am pleased with the design I just wish the actual picture was bigger an putting it together doesn't make sense the numbers aligned with the branches don't make any sense compared to the picture they give you as an instruction -- you have to sort of free hand. I had to start it half way up my wall so it made a difference an could actually be seen -- as far as it hold up I put it up about 2 weeks ago an it had not peeled off at all.,3
Super Mario Game Nintendo Wall Sticker and Decal,These do not stick to the wall. They start to peel as soon as you stick them to the wall.,1
New Style Trailing Cherry Blossom Tree Decal Removable Vinyl Kids Wall Decal Wall Sticker Peel and Stick,Was so excited to get this product for my baby girls bedroom!  When I got it the back is NOT STICKY at all!  Every time I walked into the bedroom I was picking up pieces off of the floor!  Very very frustrating!  Ended up having to super glue it to the wall...very disappointing.  I wouldn't waste the time or money on it.,1
Blessed By Pope Francis Franciscan Knotted Our Lady of Grace Italian Made Aurora Borealis Crystal Rosary,"I ordered this Rosary for a friend because it looked lovely in the photo and it is blessed by Pope Francis.  I was not disappointed as it is just beautiful, made with crystal, and knotted in between the Our Fathers.  I am giving this to my friend along with a copy of the novena of Our Lady Untier (or Undoer) of Knots, for whom Pope Francis has a strong devotion.  I definitely recommend this Rosary and would buy it again in a heart beat.",5
Blessed By Pope Francis Infant Jesus of Prague Nino De Praga Medal Charm Pendant,An excellent value and quality for the price.  Just right for wearing around the neck orattaching to a Brown Scapular or some such. And the Blessing makes the Item all the more Precious.,5
Musical Christmas Nativity Scene Angel with Baby Jesus in a Rustic Barkwood Resin Manger 8&quot; Tall,I was so excited to get this nativity.  I have been watching it for months and I finally had an excuse to spend $25.00.  It is beautiful and I am very happy with the look of the item.  I am not so happy about the music box.  The song is WAY too fast and it had to play it through once to even recognize the song.  I don't know if there is a way to slow down a music box; if there is I wish someone would tell me.  I still love the nativity but I am not as excited as I would be if the music had been right.Buyer beware... beautiful nativity; not so great music,3

I love the bangles however they are a bit small. Had to slid them on with lotion. I like a snug fitting bangle but whew these were tough to get on!! If my hand was a hair bigger they wouldn't have fit. They are on to stay. I have small hands also. I got the size for large kid small adult and they fit wrist but tough over the hand. Overall satisfied with product and fast shipping!,4

"IKEA KLADD PRICKAR Bib, blue, red",I like those bibs. they are very useful. easy to wash and dry. the price is awesome. My friends also like them very much.,4
"IKEA KLADD PRICKAR Bib, blue, red","This bibs provided very good protections for messy eaters, my grandson is a 20 months old beautiful boy who loves to eat his marinara pasta with his fingers.

Holy Family Baby Jesus and Star Nativity Christmas Tree Ornament,"This is such a cute ornament, I collect nativity ornaments and this is perfect for my collection! Can't wait to add it to my nativity tree!",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",We used this to help us keep track of pees and poops during that first month. It is really helpful if you breastfeed to keep track of feeding patterns and wet diapers to make sure baby is eating enough. Great book!,5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","This book is going to be a life saver! We are adopting and when we travel complete the adoption, I needed a book to keep track of baby's schedule. I have a terrible memory and this book will be perfect for keeping track of baby's schedule. I also love how there is a spot at the beginning for emergency numbers and important info. Perfect for traveling, the babysitter or just for at home use. I will definitely be buying more after I fill this up.",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","Love it love it love it!!  Got my first baby tracker as a gift, bought another one as soon as it was used up.  Great for daycare, too, so you can communicate with your provider about baby's activities for the day.  Also great for round the clock care- no need to ""remember"" when baby ate last or how much sleep you really got!!  Get it for your new moms- to- be!!",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","Of course this has been a great/easy way for me to record all of my baby's routines and a simple way for his caregiver to let me know how the day went.  What I really love about it, though, is that it was so easy for me to jot down all of his major milestones as they happened.  I knew that I wouldn't have time to work on his baby book in the beginning (and sure enough I didn't even get it out until after 2 months), and because I had this book I was able to finally transfer everything over.  Life saver!!  All of the funny little things would probably have been forgotten!",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","I am 4 weeks from delivery of my first baby and was looking for a newborn tracker. From the reviews I read this one looked like it had everything that one needs to write down and remember, so I bought it. I have not used it but I am very happy with what I saw. Hope it ends up being as useful at it looks.",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","We found this book at a rummage sale and found it to be so useful, especially when several people are helping with the baby (ex: visiting family, etc.)  We loved it so much that I've bought another one and have almost filled that one too.  I like having the room to write things about our baby's day and development, plus use the ""Notes"" section to write some story, etc.  It also helps ""Dad"" see what has happened that day and feels more connected.  I will be buying another one soon!",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",I got this baby tracker as part of the 'new parents' package from my work. It is extremely well organized ... much better then others I've seen. It is an iParenting Media Winner and for a good reason. Absolutely worth the $$. I am getting this for all my expecting friends! 5 starts!,5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","I'm a new mom and I was looking for something to record my baby's daily activities and patterns and it is perfect! It has a lot of space to write down anything extra beyond the diaper changes, feedings and sleeping. I like that it has an area to write down medications. It is a great reminder for dr appointments and to track your baby's patterns. I am extremely happy with this book and will be ordering another one for when I run out of pages in 3 months.",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",Love this book ....super easy to keep track and sooooooooo helpful for this first time mom ..especially for pediatrician appts,5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",I loved how this book was set up to keep track of everything important about baby.  I used it for the first year.  I always took it to doctor appointments to share how often she was eating and everything.,5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",I've been using it since I have my newborn and it's a great way to keeping track of baby&#34;s schedule,5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","I used a tracker with my first son - but I didn't so much need to with my second.  This tracker though, is laid out very well and keeps things pretty organized.  My only complaint is that it is not a full year tracker - I did the whole first year with my first son which is nice to refer back to.  I would recommend this book, but if you're interested in tracking the whole first year you will need to buy 3 (they run 4 months long).",4
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","This is the best way to keep track of when your baby eats, sleeps, poops, gets a bath, etc. It's also a great way to keep track of which side baby nursed on. I took this to all infant doc appt. And it's a great gift!",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","I rarely write a review however, this journal has been a lifesaver.  Sleep deprivation can compromise anyones ability to recall feeding and napping times, which breast was last used, soiled diapers, etc.. I even sleep with my journal to keep it close by so I can document around the clock.  The layout of this journal is very simple and easy to use at a quick glance.  I understand there are phone apps that do the same thing however, I chose this journal to allow my husband and nanny to have access to the information.  A must have and will make a great gift.",5
"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",I received this at my baby shower and it has been a wonderful gift. I had no idea when I received it what fun it would be to record all this information. I have done this for 2 children now and only wish I would have had it for my first 2 kids.,5
"Large Jungle Animals (Panda, Lion, Elephant, Gorilla) - 3D Wall Murals for Baby Nursery and Kids Rooms - Made in USA",I ordered these for my 7 month old sons play area.  They are very cool.  I love the fact that they can be removed from the wall and moved to a room or house if needed.  I would get these instead of wall decals because they are 1. easier to put up and 2. can be moved without ruining them.  It makes his play area look really cool!,5
Edu-Petit Happy Jungle Day Finger Puppet Book Developmental Toy,My 2 year old grandson got it for Christmas and he loves when his Mommy reads it to him.  Good quality and very well made.  Other positive reviews directed me to buy it.,5
Edu-Petit Teddy Bobo's Big Learning Book Developmental Toy,"I bought this for my 17 month old son as a form of quiet, in-crib entertainment when he wakes up at 5am. So far, he likes it a lot... even got an ""ooooooh"" when I first handed it to him.",4
Modern House Thomas Train and Friends removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,"i hung these over my sond headboard in his thomas themed room, they havent fallen off the wall, applied a week ago so maybe they will be okay but they seemed kinda cheaply made. they do look good and as i said they havent fallen down, if they do i will be sure to revise my review to avoid anyone else making my mistake.",3
Modern House White Plum Blossom with Green Birds Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,"a little difficult if you dont know how you want it to be placed on your wall, so be creative, it comes off easily so you can play around with it.. the result looks beautiful. very peaceful.",5

Modern House Trailing Cherry Blossom Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,well its not as big as it looks in the picture but it is awfully cute looking. actually is only about one foot tall.,4
Modern House Trailing Cherry Blossom Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,I haven't put these up yet but I was disappointed in the color of the flowers. They look more purple than pink.,2
Modern House Safari Animal Family removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,"the instructions were really clear, howerver the next day the decals started coming off because my wall has ridges on it soooo. I added a little dab of crazy glue and walah! it's up.",5
Modern House Safari Animal Family removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,The designs were cut and easy to apply. There was no sticky residue when we peeled it off to readjust and it was to redo the adjustment again and again. It was also just sticky enough to stick to the wall while not too sticky enough to peel the paint off. We like it.,5
Modern House Angry Bird I removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,"Grandchildren opened these before they got home and stuck them to everything in my house, even themselves. Hope they will still stick on wall when they get home.",5
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,My daughter started playing with her Music Blocks set when she was just a few months old.  She spent hours entertaining herself.  She is now 18 months old and still loves this toy.  Now she understands how to arrange the blocks and has great fun making new musical patterns.  I highly recommend the Jumpin' Jive Jazz cartridge -- it's her favorite -- and the Bach cartridge when you want calmer music.,5
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"It takes a youthful spirit of inquiry and fascination to play with blocks and pre-programmed music. Anyone too old to play with blocks (or to young to play with them again) may back off. But they're missing a revolution in interactive toys. Each colored block represents part of a musical score, and each side on the block represents one way of delivering that piece, such as horn, violin, or voice. Turning and swapping blocks thus generates changes in the music played, with incredible variety. You (and, oh yes, the child too) will run out of steam long before you run out of interest. And the use of additional block sets expands the use and interest even more. Bravo!!",5
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,This was one of my favorite toys-but beware if you buy this I went through 3 of these- and the company no longer exists-so if there is a problem with it-you are out of luck,3
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"Our whole family loved the Mozart music blocks. I even bought another &quot;disk&quot; of music. Unfortunately, it was a constant challenge to keep the kids from destroying the delicate &quot;chip&quot; that was easily accessible. Finally it broke and I felt it was too expensive to replace. I feel that a toy at this price should be more durable. My suggestion would be to hide the &quot;plug in chip&quot; so that the kids aren't attracted to it. We have a 3-year old and a one-year old. The toy lasted about 6 months.",4
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"This is an interesting and educational toy.  I got it for my 2 year old, and while she loved mixing up the blocks, she also loved pulling out the cartridge and couldn't put it back in.  That means I had to go put the cartridge back every 5 minutes.  If the cartridge were placed on the side or back, I don't think the littler ones would be so inclined to pull it...out of sight out of mind.",4
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"Great idea, but the toy IS NOT durable.  After returning one toy for not working, another one has broken.  What a disappointment!!  And the customer service is non-existant and when it is, they are rude!!!! Someone let me know when the class-action lawsuit will occur.",1
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,I bought this 18 months ago for my 6 year old and 2 year old.  They both loved it.  I bought additional cartridges then it stopped working.  We replaced the batteries twice and it still does not work.  It was expensive for a toy that did not last very long.,4
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"I spent [a lot of money] when this thing first came out, and it worked TERRIBLY!  I sent it back to the company because it was defective and wouln't shut up.  They sent me another one.  It worked very inconsistently.  When I called the manufacturer I was told ""Well, it's a very sensitve computer, you can't just let them toss it around, that must be why you're having trouble""  Actually, I was having my 2 year sit in his high chair while I supervised him, and he was not doing anything to it.  I mean, it says it's for 2 year olds on the box....  Anyway, I returned it and got my money.  SAve your money for real music lessons.",5
Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,Recently I have purchased the musical mozart blocks set for my two and a half year old daughter at a toys r us department store near me as a Christmas gift for her this year and they had one of the toys out on display. She loved the toy and it is very educational. I had a hard time leaving the store because she wanted to continue to play with it although she is young enough that even though she was with me while I purchased her toys for Christmas this year that she had completely forgotten about it and that I haought this toy for her. My only complaint is that I had to pay [$$$] for this toy and they had told me that the sale on the toy had ended yesterday but this toy I knew was still available online here for [$$$] which is a really good price and I do not think it is right for them to sell it for the other price when it can be bought cheaper. Anyways I liked the toy alot and my daughter did too and that is why I purchased the toy even at the price I  had to pay for it. I think it will get a lot of use out of it and so will my 8 month old daughter when she is old enough as well.,5
"Milestones, Kids' Step Stone Kit",Product was very easy to use.  I helped my son (16 months at the time) make a stepping stone for Father's Day.  He put the stones in himself and it turned out really cute.,5
Sesame Street Baby Purse Playset,"My girls love this Sesame Street purse! There are 5 items that can be placed inside of the purse. They use it when they pretend to go shopping around the house. It was a little tricky for my 18 month old to figure out how to open it but she eventually learned. The bright colors, durable design and sweet Sesame Street character faces make it such a fun purchase!",5
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"I bought this for my son when he was 4 months old.  He loves all the little animals, but even now at 8 months, he doesn't seem interested in putting them in the fish bowl.  However, he will take them out if they are in there.  My son is very active, so maybe that's contributing to why he doesn't really use the bowl...",3
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,I purchased this item for my son and its going to be returned the star fish he cant hold on to the fish the only thing he can hold on to was the crab and he liked that because it crinkled.. This is not Our favorite Lamaze toy and it will be going back to the store..,3
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"My one-year-old baby loves this toy!  She loves to take the fish in and out, and watch through the transparent sides as she takes them in and out.  She loves to play peek-a-boo through the sides.  She loves to shake/squeeze each fish to hear its noise.  Downside: the fish are easy to misplace, so keeping all four together is a challenge.",5
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"I bought this toy to help stimulate my eight-month-old's development. When I got it in the mail, I immediately opened it and gave it to her. She has been playing with it since. Her favorite is the crinkle crab because she can make him make noise. She is fascinated by the others. She very quickly learned how to take them out and put them back into the bowl. She has had no difficulty in doing that. Great item, worth the money!! And it is so fun to watch!!",5
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"Everyone knows nap time can be difficult, my daughter fights it everyday, sometimes she'll even jump around and hit the sides of her crib. We decided putting some of those cribside toys made of hard plastic was unrealistic at this point, however I saw this and got it right away.Although we had tried stuffed animals and other soft toys this works he best. It's a lot more interactive compared with just hugging her teddy bear. Everyday she plays with it, it also occupies her in the morning when she first wakes. I walk into her room and there she is holding her fishy. Plus if she rolls on it during the night there's no chance of hurting herself. She loves it.Great value! Something a little different.",5
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,This is a very good toy that helps manual dexterity and the ability to recognize figures behind the clear plastic. My baby girl especially loves the crinkle crab and the clam !,5
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,We first bought this toy for our oldest child when she was just beginning to sit up and play with toys.  She would sit in her crib and play for a hour or more just putting the sea creatures in and out.  It gave Mommy shower and make-up time!  We believe she loved the clear plastic on the bowl and the shape and feel of the pieces.  We had the same experience with daughter #2.  We have bought this several times for other new parents.  Our girls have also received similar toys (not Lamaze) ex: a cookie jar and have not enjoyed it anywhere near as much.  A little toy with big entertainment value!,5
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"I saw this toy before I was pregnant and though it was so cute!So after I had my daughter, I had the best excuse to buy it!!!She loves it.  I bought it for her when she was about 3 months old.  She'd chew on the little clam.  Now she uses it to learn that they make noise, and she can put them in and take them out of the bowl.It's worth the money.  Cute, educational, (quiet.. heh), and durable.",5
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"We received this as a present for our 6 month old.  I don't really think she's old enough to put the individual toys in the fishbowl, but she sure loves playing with them!  I've noticed that she likes &quot;crinkly&quot; toys, so she loves the crab.  So far, it has kept her very entertained.  I really like Lamaze products so far",4
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"I bought this toy for my baby and for friends' babies as well. The babies really love the faces on the toys and get a kick out of the different sounds each one makes. They enjoy looking at them through the clear plastic and taking them out and putting them back in over and over. Most kids seem fascinated by ocean creatures anyway, so I think it's bound to be a guaranteed &quot;hit&quot; for any child. My 2 1/2 year old still loves to play with the crab!",4
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"This toy was given to my son by his grandmother.  I saw Lamaze and immediately thought it would be a great toy.  Not the case.My son received this fish bowl when he was about 4 months old.  He is now 9 months.  He chews on the crab for hours, but other than that not much else.  I feel that this is an expensive teething toy.I like the variety of color and the different textures of fabric the toy offers.",2
my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"I bought this for my son when he was 6mos.  He LOVED it!  What great little teethers each of the sea creatures make.  However, 1.5mos down the road, he totally ignored it.  It was beyond his developmental path.  Cute toy, but I'm not sure it's worth it.",3
Pedal Farm Tractor,"We chose this tractor and trailer for a family gift for our two-year-old son and he loves it!  Visiting friends love it, too.  We looked at several others, but this one seemed to be the safest and most durable.  He cannot pedal the tractor yet, but loves to push it around or be pushed while sitting on it and will soon grow to it (he is tall).  The trailer is a great addition and our son loves to fill it with toys (or his little brother!).  The only negative is that the ""hitch"" for the trailer does not lock in place and can be turned causing the trailer to come off at bad times, but we would still recommend it.  The assembly was easy and our little farmer has been thrilled!",5
Pedal Farm Tractor,I bought this for my son when he was 3 years old.  He is now 8 and handed it down to my younger son when he turned 2.  After 5 years of rough and tough riding it is just now starting to break down.  This has been an awesome toy.  We also purchased the trailer and the boys have loved them both.  I think it would have lasted even longer if my 8 year old would have stayed off of it after he had outgrown it.  Anyway the only thing you need to keep in mind is that there is no brake so be careful on hills.,5
Pedal Farm Tractor,We bought this tractor to accompany the trailer.  Our grandsons are big into farm stuff and love to load up the trailer and pretend they are working ""on the farm.""  It is best for those old enough to reach the pedals (age 3 and up?).  It is very sturdy and durable.  Great toy for those busy toddlers and preschoolers.  Worth every penny it cost!,5
Pedal Farm Tractor,"We bought this tractor for our 2 and a half-year-old son, and he is able to pedal and manuever this vehicle very well, despite the recommended age of 3-6 years. This tractor is very sturdy, and nearly impossible to tip over. My son has deserted all other riding toys in favor of this tractor. I highly recommend purchasing the yellow trailer that is specifically made for this tractor, but is sold separately .... My son loads all kinds of treasures into the trailer and farms the yard for long periods of time....",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"We bought these for our son when he turned two. He had seen them at a playmate's home and LOVED them. I liked them b/c unlike some of the other cars for sale...there is some learning value and they are VERY durable. They have been thrown, rolled, stepped on, etc and still show no signs of wear. Highly recommend!",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"My son loves stacking cups, so a friend recommended this toy to me.  My son loves it and he enjoys pushing them around the floor.  They nest nicely into each other, which makes it a great toy for the diaper bag.",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"My son Cameron just loves these great little stacking cars!  He enjoys stacking them and slapping them down and each has great little things that they do such as his fire truck has a ladder that clicks up and down, police car has a spinning &quot;light&quot; bar, and so on.  I think it's great, brightly colored and has great little faces....I would give this as a gift in the future, not a wasted toy, Oh the little wheels roll, too!",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"My one year old son received these as a birthday gift. He loves them. Not only are they stackable, which helps with hand-eye coordination, but each car has individual moveable features. Although these features are small, they got his attention. The bright colors are nice also. They are a great buy for the price!  I highly recommend them as first trucks for a small child.",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,I purchased this toy for my great grandson's first Christmas. He will be 6 months old. I can't wait to play with it with him. This is the first baby in our family for 18 years and all the family is waiting for the fun... I will be ordering a lot more soon. Thank you for the convenient shopping. AJ'S Gee-Gee (Great Grandmom),5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"I've owned this set for several years.  My 4 granddaughters love to play with the cars.  Stacking, nesting, playing with the few moving parts.  It is one of their favorite toys when they come over.  And it is definitely one of mine - Lots of play value that stores very well.  They have learned colors, and numbers with these also.",4
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"These are a huge hit with my one year old son.  We received these cars as a gift when my son was first born.  He started taking a real interest in them when he was about seven months old and still plays with them every day.  They are simple, durable, do not require batteries, and are easy to clean.  We've traveled a lot with my son and these make terrific travel toys as they pack up easily and don't take up much space since they nest.  The smallest car rattles and is the perfect size for little hands.",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"This is a great toy.  The wheels really work and each car has a special feature.  They store easily for packing on trips and putting away.  Both of my kids (boy and girl) have played with them.  They are brightly colored.  And best of all, these do not use batteries!",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My 11 month old received these last Christmas and he instantly began running them along the floor and playing with them. He is now 22 months and I have taught him his colors using these and he STILL loves to play with them.  One got run over by an electric scooter and it didn't even break! All parents should get these for your baby.  This is the one toy that will NOT sit and collect dust!,5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My 14 month old son loves to stack and play with these little cars.  They are durable and easy to clean.  I throw them in  the diswasher and they hold up great.  They are well worth the money to me.,5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"Great toys, we always pack one or two in the diaper bag, our 7 month old loves to play with them and I don't worry at all about him chewing on these toys as there are only smooth surfaces",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"My son has played with these from 6 months old, and still likes them occasionally (18 months now).  The small car is nice for babies to shake.  They don't do much, but they are cute.",4
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,After being inundated with toys that require batteries and make so much noise this was a breath of fresh air. My son loves these vehicles! We got this when he was 6 months old. We stack them on top and he loves to knock it over. We nest them and he loves to find the surprise vehicle underneath. Now that he is 8 months old he is figuring out that the wheels move as well as some of the other moving features on each vehicle. I highly recommend this toy.,5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"I bought these for my 1 1/2 year old, and he loves them (and so does his 5-year old brother). They both stack the cars, hide them and ""vrroomm"" them. It is great to find a toy that doesn't need batteries or require an engineering degree to put together!Highly recommended.",4
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,We bought these trucks for our 15 mo. old daughter and 4 mo. old son- We love them!  They are nesting which is fun for our daughter to look underneath the trucks to find the next one or they can stack one on top of the other to make a tower.  Perfect first trucks!  And they aren't too big- a perfect size!,5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My son got this stacking truck set as a baby gift.  He was able to play with the trucks at about 6 months and they are still played with today (my son will be 2 next month). The overall durability of this toy is great; they look as good as when we got them even after lots of play and being taken along on many trips. I have not seen this toy in any store - so get it here while you still can!  It has been a much used toy and I highly recommend it for your small child.,5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"I bought the cars because they were easy to store, plus they were cars.  What I have found is that I can actually use then in many places since there is more than one vehicle.  Mostly they are easy to pack for a trip.",4
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"My daughter loves these vehicles. She likes to watch them disappear as you stack them inside each other. And she loves to stack them atop of each other. Then she plays with them as cars, and even makes the sounds they make. They are wonderful fun toys, and great to take with you on trips, they are compact!",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My son loves this stacking toy. It is much more fun than the stackable rings toy even though he does have that one too. All the boys at our baby group have it and the babies who don't always come up to see what it is all about! You can't go wrong with this purchase.,5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"I got this toy for my daughter when she was very little.  She really hasn't been interested until recently.  Now she loves to put little people inside the cars and look at them through the top.  She lets objects play hide-and-seek under the cars but she really doesn't stack them or nest them very much.  I think they are worth the money because they were fairly cheap but she hasn't really used them for the intended purpose.  I don't think I would buy them again but I certainly wouldn't take them back if they were given to me. I think my daughter will use them in different ways with other toys, in the tub or pool or even outside as she grows.  They are extremely durable.",4
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"Okay, well they don't really beep.  (But my 11-month old son loves when we roll these along and SAY &quot;beep beep!&quot;)  At this point, my son's favorite aspect of these cars is the little sunroof, siren and ladder on the tops.  He can sit there for ten minutes just flipping the sunroof back and forth!  Go figure!  These cars are super sturdy and have taken quite a beating on our coffee table.  (They're in much better shape than the coffee table at this point.)  I love that they nest together so they don't take up too much space when they're put away.  I also like that he can grow into them once he understands the nesting/stacking part better.  A great toy...gets played with each and every day!",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"For well over a year my son has enjoyed stacking and playing with these cars. They have held up brilliantly to his abuse - they still look like new. Fun to stack, fun to roll. Clever toy that has been a winner with my son since he was one.",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"We just bought this for my 9 month old daughter,she loves these cars, loves to turn the wheels and lookat the faces. She especially loves the little green car,it's the perfect size to fit in her tiny hand and it rattles.This toy is a hit! I highly recommend it.",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My son got this for Christmas and he loves all the cars.  His favorite is the fire truck.  He plays with it for a while.,4
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"This is a wonderful toy that is fun, educational, and affordable! The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor. I would highly recommend this item.",5
Fisher-Price Slumbertime Soother with Remote Control,"My mother-in-law bought 2 of these for our twin boys-- one for each crib-- and they have been a life saver in getting our boys to settle down at night and go to sleep. Now our boys do not sleep without it! Anytime we are going somewhere overnight, we take at least one with us. It is also the only toy that plays music by itself for more than 30 sec. It will play for about 10 minutes!! It's our standard gift for all of our parent friends.",5
Fisher-Price Slumbertime Soother with Remote Control,"My daughter had this in her crib until she was 2 and loved it.  When she got old enough she loved to turn it on and off by herself.  I used this every night for her to go to sleep by. I used the place that you store the remote control in for extra pacifiers, so if she lost one during the night she would know where to find one.  I never used the remote, but loved the idea another had about putting in the car for rear facing infants when they get fussy you could just turn it on with the remote.  It's not too bright and the volume is adjustable.  Someone had said it eat batteries quickly,but I found that they lasted a very LONG time and I used it EVERY night. I highly recommend this product!!",5
Fisher-Price Slumbertime Soother with Remote Control,I bought this product when my son was about 10 months old.  He was still having problems going to sleep at night and naptime.  The Slumbertime Soother is great.  I sing along with the songs.  My son turns it on himself and sometimes just plays with it.  The nature sounds relax him.  I really like the fact that it plays for ten minutes without stopping.,5
Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,"I bought this toy for an addition to my son's exerciser. However, it would not stick (to anything)!! I tried everything to make it stick. It was very frustrating.",1
Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,"i bought this beautie at k mart for 5 bucks. other that the suction cup not really working out well, my 3 month old loves it. hell, my husband and i also enjoy playing with it. it has a variey of colours and shapes that help stimulate the mind. you cant lose.",4
Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,"I bought this to use on the high chair, but within 2 days my son had the rattle part off the base. Needless to say it never went back on for more than 5 min. BUT he did enjoy it in the car and other places.",3
Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,"My son loved this toy.  He enjoyed playing with it in his highchair until he was 10 months old.  At that point he was strong enough to pull the toy from its' base.  He pulled it so hard, he smashed himself in the face with it.  After that upsetting experience, we didn't put it in the base anymore.  He did still play with it as a rattle, but it did not hold his attention as well.  I would like to see this toy redesigned so that it cannot be separated from its' base.",3
Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,"My son is nearly a year old and received this toy about 9 months ago.  We both love Sassy toys.  This one is bright and amusing.  Stick it on a car window, high chair tray, restaurant table, bathroom tile,...  We were disappointed in the life of the suction cup, but for all other reasons--color, amusement, education, and co-ordination--get one of these!",5
Sassy Smiley Face Rattle,"This toy is very cute, it has two handles for little hands to grasp, a mirror on one side and on the other the smiley face! the face has wiggly eyes and a nose to beep. but the nose can be frusterating for babies as my 18month old son still has a hard time beeping it! my all in all a cute,durable toy!!",5
Sassy Circle Rattle,My son (who is now 2+ yrs) loved this rattle as a baby.  He loved it so much that I have given it to all of my mommy- friends as a gift.  This is the best toy to have for a young baby.  You will get them to smile for those all-important-photos with this one!!,5
Sassy Circle Rattle,"Both of my sons love this toy. My two year old played with it when he was a baby, and it found its way to the bottom of his toy box at Granny's. We found it about a month ago and his 5 month old baby brother began to play with it. Suprise Suprise he loves it too! And his big brother tries to steal it away. This toy is durable, and fun. What more could mom ask for??",5
Sassy Circle Rattle,"What I don't love about this is that the clear part, where the baby can watch the beads move with motion, contains BPA.  However, my daughter found this rattle a comfort to her while teething and chewed only the big protruding ball, which as far as I know is free from both PVC and BPA.  I thought she would like the textures of the rings, but nope, it was all about the ball.Also appreciated the bright colors.  This is a good bang for your buck baby toy -- for a while there we always had it in the diaper bag when we left the house.Best at about 6-12 months.  Can't see it getting a lot of use before 3 months and just not interesting to a toddler, even a toddler who is still teething.",5
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,"I was concerned about the chemical content of this ""plastic"" book since a baby will undoubtedly stick it in his mouth. I emailed Sassy and got a reply saying that this was BPA, PVC and Phtalates free. I can breathe a sigh of relief when I hand this to our baby...soon!",5
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,"We bought this for our 5 month old and put pictures of relatives that live far away inside the pages.  The book is very sturdy, &quot;chewable&quot; and has a lot of great colors/designs to look at.  Now at 8 months, this book is still one her favorites!  Plus she sees her grandma's and grandpa's, etc, faces every day.  We love it.",5
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,I bought this for a new granddaughter.  I will not get to see her often as she lives in another state.  This book is great for out pictures and she can carry it around and look at the pictures as she would a book.  This way she can recognize us when we show up.  It is easy to carry and cleaning it is simple.  It is a great little photo book.,5
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,"I originally bought this for my 4 month old son, but my 17 month old daughter has taken it over.  We filled it with pictures of mom and dad, 2 sets of grandparents, and all the cousins with their families (there are only 6 slots for pics, but we took pictures of entire families - so we have 20 people in all).  She loves pointing to the pictures and identifying various people.  The pages are made out of thin plastic material and filled with foam, so are pretty soft, but still durable. The slots are sized for 3x5 inch pictures.  My 4 month old hasn't gotten much out of it yet, but I'm sure he'll love it just as much in months to come.",5
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,This is a nice photo book for babies as it has clear plastic sleeves to protect the pictures you place inside.,5
Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,"Based on articles on the dangers of PVC plastic books, this book was tested and found to contain chemicals that are highly toxic for babies and toddlers. This materials have already been banned from children's toys in Europe.In order to read the many articles online that specifically name this book as having been found to contain chemicals that are dangerously toxic for children, google ""toxic bath books"" or the title of the book with the word ""toxic.""This book's concept is wonderful, but those who love children should share photos in another kind of album or book.",1
Earlyears: Earl E. Bird with Teething Rings,"We received an Earl E. Bird as a gift when we had our first baby eleven years ago. Since then, Earl has seen us through teething for three kids, and is still in good condition for our fourth baby!  He's a little faded around the edges, but just as loveable and soft, with difference textures for a chewy, drooly baby to gnaw on.I like that he's fully washable, and a nice quiet toy (at least in ours, the squeaker was very quiet to begin with and has since kind of stopped squeaking--but the squeaker was never the big attraction with Earl).  Perfect for taking on planes, or in church, or in the car. A great baby shower gift, since Earl is perfect for a boy or a girl.",5
Earlyears: Earl E. Bird with Teething Rings,"This little toy is safe for infants, and offers great color, texture and even sound.  Very Sweet, though a little pricey.",5

"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","I had a book similar to this as a child and it brings back wonderful memories! My 20 month old struggles with several of the items, such as the shoe laces and snaps. But he loves the zipper and the Velcro shapes and the other pages give him a great way to learn and practice. Overall it's an item that he can grow into and it's super cute!",5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","My daughter enjoys taking it apart more than putting it back together, but a great product.  It has kept her occupied while flying.",5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","Got this for a plane ride 3 months ago. The snaps are hard to snap and he gets frustrated. Most pieces are attached to the book which is nice, he can't lose them. He flips thru it but that is about it. Maybe when we travel again he will find it more interesting. We keep it for trips only so it will be ""new"" each time. He has seen it up on the shelf and asks for it but when we give it to him he is done flipping thru in a few minutes and it is left on the floor for other books.",4
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children",I bought this for my grandbaby for Christmas. She loves it and my daughter kept saying it was such a neat toy.,5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children",My 8 month toddler enjoys this book. Very good idea with mind-stimulating activities on each page. Well worth it for the price.,5

"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","I really like this book. You can show your baby shapes, teach her how to use buttons, zipper and snaps, tie a shoe and tell time. My baby is too young for most of these activities at this time, but she already loves to play with this book. I see a lot of quality time spent with this book in the future.",5
"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","My 2 yr+ old grand daughter liked this book a lot.  She did have a hard time with some the buttons or snaps.  They were sewn pretty tight to the backing and was kind of hard to get her fingers under to be able to button or snap.  Overall, she did enjoy each activity.",4
Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning,"I ordered this book for the up-coming birthday of a grandson. It really is cute and an excellent quality. It comes with a small stuffed bear that you can remove from the book. Each page of the book has a different night-time activity for the bear to do such as have a glass of milk, brush his teeth etc. I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting because even though it is a quality toy I'm not sure that Liam will use it enough to make it worth the price I paid.  The Pockets of Learning toys all seem to be very high quality if somewhat pricy.",4
Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning,"Both of my boys liked playing with this book.  They also liked to take the bear out and play with him.  The pajamas are a little hard to put on, but they didn't seem to care much.  My youngest actually has slept with the little bear!",4
Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning,"This book is very cute, and despite other comments I found it to be well made. My son is not real interested though but maybe he will later on. I just think that it doesn't have enough pages and interactivity for the price you are paying.",3
Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning,"This is a cute, interactive book made out of fabric. It walks you though the night routine (1. Drink your milk, 2. Brush your teeth, 3. Take off your clothes, 4. take a bath, 5. Put on pajamas, 6. Bedtime story, 7. Say a prayer, 8. Lullaby and goodnight) - works well for praying people - unfortunately, I bought it for an agnostic family!",3
Baby Monitor - Direct Link Privacy Monitor,"Considering how horrible the selection is these days for choosing a quality baby monitor that doesn't transmit to anyone and everyone who may be listening in, intentionally or unintentionally, this seems to be one of the best choices to make.  Your scrambled voice will sound like Donald Duck on a regular analog 46-49 mhz cordless phone or radio scanner, so it's at least a moderate roadblock for the average signal interceptor.  However, why on earth there is no 900 mhz (or higher) digital-spread-spectrum baby monitor on the market is beyond me.  So, this unit is one of the better compromises out there, and at ... on amazon.com, it is amazingly affordable.",3
"North American Bear Company Sleepyhead Bunny Blue, Blue Stripe, Medium","This is a perfect baby gift:  washable, no parts on which to choke, snuggly, VERY durable and best of all you can give the same gift to all children in the family, by just monogramming an ear.",5
"North American Bear Company Sleepyhead Bunny Blue, Blue Stripe, Medium","My 3 year old son goes EVERYWHERE with Blue Bunny. This is his 6th one since he was born.

He is so soft and cozy. Great friend for small children.",5

Big and Small Chime Ball by Sassy,"This is an iteresting ball that my baby has loved from about 6 months to 18+ months.  The chime is pleasant, not annoying and this ball is easy for a baby to pick up and manipulate.  It is my understanding that the Sassy line is BPA and Phalate free, so you dont have to worry about your child putting this toy in her mouth.",5
Big and Small Chime Ball by Sassy,"This toy is a hardier toy than most, I found it is a great toy for my middle sized parrots who love to play with balls with bells in them. So far this toy has lasted almost a year now.",5

Pooh Baby's First Tigger,Perfect for young children and overall good quality for the price.,5
Pooh Baby's First Tigger,"I actually got the ""Pooh"" one which for some reason is not advertised on babiesrus.com/amazon.I believe that toys like this sometimes are more for the parents as opposed to the babies, but still it is a cute toy!  It went with my newborn son everywhere we went because it fit perfectly with him in his carrier and it was a cute, small toy we could use to interact with.  At 9-months-old he's not at that age where he's hugging, chewing, just all out playing with his toys and he likes it for that reason.  But babies need more that just stuffed animals.  He's obviously much more interested in toys that make sounds or light so his Pooh mostly stays in his room with the other 'dolls'.This is still a cute item.  I haven't had to wash it yet, but it sure is durable.",5
Pedella Wooden Push Toy,"This is a must have for any toddler!  I bought one for my brothers triplets who were 1 1/2 years old at the time.  They loved it!  One would push & the other 2 would chase after it.  They love watching the duck waddle & its feet go round & round.  Best of all, no batteries!  Yaayyyy!!Fifteen years ago, I bought my daughter a little push clown from the same company.  It was her favorite toy & was passed onto her brother.  With heavy playing by 2 children it never lost any of its paint or parts.  It's something we are saving for grandchildren one day.",5
Infant Stim-mobile,"Love this mobile!  It is challenging and their eyes are drawn to it.  My son couldn't look at it until he got older as he didn't like high contrast, but at @ 7 mo he got into it.  If you are a parent who appreciates observing the small nuances of learning that occur in the development process--you will be able to witness it with this toy.  I'm not a parent trying to turn my children into geniuses, but definitely into maximizing their capabilities to incite their own curiosities.  Keeping children zoned out is not a priority--so for those who want to do that--turn on the tv and buy toys with bells and whistles.  For others, get toys like this one.",5
Infant Stim-mobile,"We found this at a garage sale and I read about it and it seemed really interesting so I bought it. This is for the first few months of a baby's life and should not move much, contrary to what the first poster said, because you want stimulation but you don't want to over-stimulate a baby. However, we did notice that sometiems our baby does like the mobile to move and it is summer here but the air conditioner blowing air around the room should be enough movement. When it's not moving, we can just put a small fan on its lowest setting about 6 feet from the crib and the small wiggling was enough movement to keep her stimulated but not so much movement that she can't keep track of the object (babies this young are not good at tracking so you don't want a lot of motion), but still we only do this once in a while, not at all times.One of the best things about this mobile is that our baby only wakes us up at night to feed. If she wakes herself up she will sit and stare at it for a long time and be happy since we have a small nightlight in the room. Any time we put her in the crib we can see her staring at the simple shapes. Shown in the picture on the product page is the detailed shapes, you flip the cardboard from the simple to the detailed shapes when they are about 2 months old, then remove this mobile for a more 'traditional' one with movement and objects the baby can grab at about 4 months. This is a somewhat delicate mobile since it uses air currents to move, so you need to keep it safe from a grabbing/eating baby.Also, one nice feature is that ours came with a travel pack, or at least that's how I'm using it. Besides the crib mount, there is an 8 inch circular plastic ring with fishing wire for hanging the mobile. You can hang it anywhere with a string, either taping string to the ceiling or tying it to any overhang. It also came with a cardboard carrying case thing which is very thin and easy to take with you on a trip.For those with a math/science background, it's really interesting to note that first side of the cards have objects with very low spatial frequency. The 'detailed' sides are actually the same patterns, but with a moderately higher spatial frequency. After 4 months, you use standard mobiles, which have very high spatial frequencies, as well as colors and things the baby can grab to improve hand-eye coordination. Basically, you start showing the child very low frequency objects that are easy to observe and track, then gradually move up until they can use the high frequency information.Now, I want to explain why I did not give this item 5 stars even though it's an amazing product. Before my baby was a month old, I noticed that she was already able to detect some colors and this stim-mobile is only black and white. This is from 1990, so I guess over the last 20 years they have refined the product so that the simple side has some red (first color a baby sees) and other simple colors, while the reverse side has more vivid colors, but uses the same idea of going from low spatial frequencies to higher spatial frequencies. I ordered the newest version but still kept this around for changing table and pack n play entertainment since she loves it. If I had not known about the improved version, I would have given it 5 stars, but there is something better available so I highly recommend getting the updated version for every newborn.",4
Fisher Price - Baby Bowling,I'm really disappointed with this toy.  It never kept my daughter's attention.,1
Fisher Price - Baby Bowling,"Cute toy, durable and is simple. Nothing sings, light up or dances...just what our kids truly need. Everything talks, spins, lights up....it is hard to find SIMPLE stimulation toys that kids have to manipulate themselves. This set challenges kids mentally as they try to figure out a. how to roll a ball b. how to aim the ball c. how to knock the pins down d. how to pick up the wobbly little guys. also you can tell your child 'aim for the red guy' or 'aim for the yellow guy'. great for teaching basic colors and counting too. don't forget you can always say WOW you knocked ONE over...and so forth. great all around and gets tossed around too so clearly after using for a month and being bashed on teh floor by little hands trying to figure out how to bounce the not bouncy ball (exploration) nothing has broken.",5
Rattlesnake Squirt,"Not that==> I &lt;==would -- ever -- do it, or recommend it, but there is a gag called theRattlesnake Eggsprank.It is nothing more than a simple mechanism hidden in an envelope that says:""WARNING: RATTLESNAKE EGGS. KEEP AWAY FROM HEAT TO AVOID HATCHING!""I can just picture someone putting a few of these prank envelopes in the backseat of""somebody's"" car next to one of these snakes. The first slight bump -- while driving --will produce a r=a=t=t=l=i=n=g sound which should MORE than just shake someone upwhen they look behind them and noticethe SNAKE!What an excellent, cruel, gag. Not for your parents---or grand parents---for OBVIOUS reasons!",5
Comfy Easy PC Play &amp; Learn Keyboard,"This product was very innovative when introduced in 1997-8.  It sold at FAO Schwarts for about $100 and we got it for our 18 month old daughter.  She used it until she was at least 3 (we then moved to Reader Rabbit).  The way it worked then -  you plugged the key board into the printer port and the sw was on two CDs. The keyboard did not require mouse skills, just visual selection of very large buttons.  Very interactive, very educational for the toddler/preschool set.  The developer was Israeli and they did not have good US distribution.  It now seems that they finally found someone to distribute it.",5
Comfy Easy PC Play &amp; Learn Keyboard,"I have to say, the first time we played with this I thought it was going to be a dud and I was thinking I would send it back.  It's very simple and not much interaction to it.  But it turns out my 2 year old daughter loves it.  She gets a kick out of it and it's all she needs in a toy.(This is the Comfy PC and not the Elmo toy.)",4
Comfy Easy PC Play &amp; Learn Keyboard,"My daughter loves this product! It covers her 2 favorite things the PC and the phone! Whenever I am on the computer she is always on my lap trying to push whatever keys she can, but with this I can put her in her highchair and put her in front of the PC and she will entertain herself for at least an hour!  She espicially loves the phone aspect on the side and what I love is there is no cord to worry about. I would definitely reccommend this to anyone with a toddler, I started using this with my daughter when she was 12 months old, she is now 15 months and loves it more now that she has gone up to another level!",4
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"all three of my kids have had one of these teethers, and it's been the favorite for all of them. i buy one for any expectant friend or family member. in our experience, the batteries last about a year & 1/2.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I've tried this for almost 6 months at different points of our kid teething and she's just not that into this. It's really heavy for a baby. When I would hold the vibrating setting on my kid would watch for a bit and even try it but just seemed bored with it and would move on. The yellow part also attracts dust and fiber out of the air like a magnet. It is ALWAYS dirty. I'm not that particular when it comes to dirt and baby stuff but it grosses me out. It's also only wire clean, so it's a more high maintenance toy.",2
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"This teether is ridiculous. It's huge, it's hard to clamp down on, and my daughter had no idea what was going on when it started vibrating in her mouth.It's just too big, awkward, and hard to push down on. Not worth the money, in my opinion.",1
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,One of my friends recommended this for me for my daughter when she was teething. It was the only thing that made her stop crying when she was teething and I tried everything imaginable. I had to hold it to make it vibrate because her mouth wasn't strong enough but it made her so happy and cuddly that is far from a complaint. Have recommended it to lots of my friends and they all love it.,5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"Great teether as it has a good texture, is easy to handle and massages the gums while baby is chewing on it.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I ordered this product after reading many of the other reviews, and I'm also pleased with this purchase. My daughter is 10-months-old and her first tooth just came through, and we'd tried everything to soothe her gums: ice cubes, teething rings, cold washcloths, you name it. At first she wasn't terribly interested in the toy, but then I took it and put it in my mouth and handed it back to her. She put it in her mouth, and I squeezed the other side to make it vibrate. The look on her face was priceless! Her eyebrows went up and I noticed she bit down harder (so I could let go), and she seemed to really like the vibration. This has since become her go-to toy when her gums seem to bother her. Also, I discovered she likes to have the little roller on the handle rubbed up and down her back. All in all this is a really well made toy that worked for my daughter exactly how I'd hoped.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,my 5mth old daughter really likes this teething toy. it has just the right amount of vibration and it triggered easily enough where she can activate it herself with little effort. i like that the 3 sides of the star have different ribbing so it feels different on her gums. great product for the money and a must have for a teething baby.,5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My 10 month old grandson thought the movement of this toy was funny! He laughs when it moves! Saying this, he does put it in his mouth but pulls it out to laugh So, I love this Teether because it makes him so happy NOT because it massages his teeth!",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My four month old started teething around two months, he has pretty impressive motor skills when it comes to using his hands but this teether is huge and you really have to apply quite a bit of pressure for it to vibrate. My other son who is two and also teething shows absolutely no intrest in this at all. Maybe in a couple more months....",1
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,It is a good teether for my handicapped student. But the ability to bit down is required which is hard for my student.,4
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"It is a great toy for them to chew and play with, but it is a bit harder for smaller babies to chew on. The vibration was a bit stronger than I was expecting, but it does not seem to bother my son a bit.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My daughter is two months and loves this in her mouth.  She seem to like the points and the softer rubber than theInfantino Vibrating Strawberry Teether.  Also it requires less pressure to make vibrate.  No she is not teething yet and no she cannot make it vibrate yet.  But if you pinch it for her, their are three different point surfaces and yes she has her favorite.  If she is getting a bit cranky, there are times this will turn her back into all smiles.  At this point, she seems to ""chew"" and vigorously suck on the points.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,This is a good idea but it takes a lot of pressure for my 7 month old granddaughter to make it vibrate.  I can squeeze one corner to make it vibrate while she chews on the other end.  Otherwise she chews it like a regular teething you.,3
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"The older one of these lasted us several years for my special needs daughter who likes the vibration. This one lasted 3 months before the battery died. Folks, you need to work on battery life or just go back to the old style teether!",1
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"A must in addition to all the teething toys. Next to Sophie the giraffe this is his favorite. I. Don't really know if the vibration massages. His gums, but he does enjoy biting into it a lot!",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My little guy loves his star teether! It's great entertainment for him, and he likes the opposite spinning side too. It was easy to introduce to him, and easy to clean too!",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,This product sucks. My little boy LOVES to chew on things while he's teething - and he bites down hard. He was never able to bite hard enough to get this dumb thing to vibrate. Very disappointing.,1
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"The yellow part vibrates once little gums/teeth chomp down on it. easy to hold on to, can easily hook (Via rings or carabiner) to a diaper bag etc. Both my kids loved it while teething.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,My son is 4 months old and can not quite get a hang of other teethers. Some of them you have to bend in a specific direction to make the vibration happen. This teether is great. They just bite down (naturally) and the vibration helps with the comfort. I love it!,5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,This arrived the next day after I bought it and I was very grateful!  We had one other one that my son managed to lose and he was miserable without it!  It really helped soothe his mouth while he was teething!,5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I have two of these teethers and both see variable use as my little guy goes through teething spurts.In between, he actually likes sitting or kneeling on the star to get it to vibrate.But as soon as his gums start hurting, he goes straight for this toy.Also, it's a smart packaging extra to have the 'free ring' on top which clearly doubles for hanging purposes.",4
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My son is obsessed with this teether!! He was first more fascinated with spinning the bottom part and chewing on that but after 4 months of having it, he has now switched and loves the rubber/vibrating part. I don't know what I would do without this one, I think it is a must have! Not only a teether but a toy as well :)",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I bought this for upcoming teething, and we still don't seem to be there, but my baby just thinks this thing is good fun.  She bites on it and the vibration cracks her up.  That's enough for me!",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,My LO is definitely teething and I've tried giving this to her but she can never get the massager to go at it on her own.  I will have to put it in her mouth and press it at the same time.  She looks at me and I imagine her thinking &#34;what the heck is that&#34; and she pulls her face away.  I'm hoping she'll want to use it again before her teeth actually come in since I can't return it at this point.  We're sticking to the fake keys and her little Sophie the Giraffe for now.,2
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"Bought this based on the reviews. My daughter is an early teether at 3 months old. My only complaint is that she has a hard time activating the vibration by biting hard enough. This has allot to do with her age. I have to hold one of the corners for her to activate the vibration. She LOVES it, I only wish it had an on/off switch so I didn't have to hold it for her. She actually cries when I try to take it away from her.",4
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,My baby loves the vibrations on his teeth. He also shakes it like a rattle. This product is good quality.,5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,I've bought several teethers and this i one of the best ones. The vibration helps ease the discomfort and the colors make it also very interesting.,5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I know it's a safety feature, but it is unfortunate that the batteries are not replaceable in this, because I will probably have to buy another one of these soon, because my little one LOVES this.  He seemed to hate all other teething options out there...even Sophie he had to learn to love (he's does like it now), but this he gnaws away on vigorously.The star shaped chewing part is a little big and that worried me a bit when I first got it, but it actually hasn't seemed to bother him that much.  So far (he got this at 5 months) he can't always make the vibration happen himself but, 1)It's not that difficult for me to just push down on it as I'm holding it for him since I like how it calms him down and 2) even when it doesn't vibrate, he still loves to chew away at it.  He has learned over time a bit better about how hard to bite down to make it go too and that it will go by chewing on any of the three available &#34;tips&#34; to the star.He also really likes the little spinning rattle on the end and it has little nibs that he likes to chomp on too (even though it is hard plastic and the star is rubber like).  It is a &#34;substantial&#34;  toy though, so if your little one is in the phase of swinging toys around really hard, they may bonk themselves now and again, but our son seemed relatively un-phased by that.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,I got this for my son when he was about 8 months. he loved bitting it and he carry it all over the house. He is now 18 months and it still works plus he still bits on it too. I found it very easy to clean too.,5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"This thing is big. Baby can grow into it. It really does help when I hold it and turn it on for him. If he isn't done with it he is sure to let me know. Which to me translates that he likes it. I'm not sure how I feel about the sticky feeling plastic, seems unnecessary and everything sticks to it.",4
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"If I can recommend one teether to buy for your teething baby, it would be this one. The vibration made it fun and it took the edge off for my little guy. The shape/handle made it really easy for him to hold. We never leave the house without this thing and it is the go-to gift I give to all my expecting friends.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"Baby loves this teether. Nice to have something different from all of the other teethers out there. The nice thing is that when she no longer wants it to vibrate, she still has fun the with handle the spins. Great product and it has lasted despite being thrown all around.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I had bought a similar toy like this in the 90's for my daughter when she was teething and now she has children. I bought one for my grandson, then more recently this one for my granddaughter. Babies love the sensation it gives them when their front teeth are coming out and making them miserable. I believe it relieves them of some of their pain and I highly recommend any parent with teething babies to get this toy for them! It is a sturdy product and you don't have to worry about any little parts coming loose or damaged. My babies and grandkids abused theirs and it still took the beating.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"We have another vibrating teether that is very similar to this one, there are some differences though.This one is much softer on the outside which could be nice on tender gums.This one has 3 points that she can use to pin point the problem area.Each point has a different texture (bumps, ridges) so there is some varianceThis one seems like it is easier to activateI will say that I don't know if she favors one for the other.  It seems like she uses them both about equally.She also likes to play with it by making it vibrate on her hands, feet, cheeks etc.  We have had a lot of fun playing with it.It's a great find and I wish I had come across it sooner.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"This is great, my son loves it and it's pretty easy for him to hold he enjoys the vibrations when he chews on it.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,A favorite in our house!,5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I had this very teether for my twin boys 8 years ago and they absolutely loved it.  So, when my new baby started teething, I sought out the same teether.  I was surprised when it arrived and the packaging stated that the product is, ""safety tested"" for BPA, lead, and phthalates.  It does not state ANYWHERE on the package that it is BPA free.  As a former regulator (of medical devices) I am very sensitive about company labeling and statements.  Perhaps too much so.  But, I would rather err on the side of caution where my child is concerned, and the lack of clear ""BPA free"" labeling on this product gives me pause.  Specifically, when they test it for BPA, lead, and phthalates, is there an acceptable amount allowed?!  If not, why wouldn't the company simply label the product as BPA, lead, and phthalate free?Eight years ago, when I gave this toy to my sons, no one had ever heard of BPA.  My boys put all manner of plastic toys in their mouths, and I'm sure it was all riddled with BPA.  But, in this day and age, when BPA is strongly suspected of being dangerous, I cannot in good conscience allow my new baby to chew on anything that MAY contain it.  And, though someone on this site indicated that a representative from the company TOLD them it was BPA free, I'm still skeptical.  Again, why not label it as such?  Most companies proudly label their products with that simple language that cannot be confused.",2
The First Years Soft Teething Beads,"My son has had this teether since he was 3 months old. I thought maybe he's just too young & not interested in it(even though he did have 2 teeth already) He is now 8 months old, and still isn't very interested in this teether. The reason I bought it was because it was in-expensive and easy for him to hold & pick up. He would rather pick up a toy car, or some sort of stuffed toy, which I understand every child is different. My only big complaint - the star bead on the end. It is hard, and pointy. If it catches my son's sore, in-coming teeth the wrong way, he will cry. Other then that, the colors are great, and definitely catch baby's eye. Overall, it's an OK toy for the price.",3
The First Years Soft Teething Beads,"This teething ring is great!  We probably have enough toys to have our own toy store, including at least 2-3 of these teething rings! Our 10-mth-old baby loves to stick one of them in his mouth (like just one bead of it) and walk or crawl around with his hands free to hold other toys.  Our 7-mth-old, loves it too, with his favorite game being to simply have one of us sit it on his head and then wait for it to fall off when he moves.  He thinks it is hestarical.  It's amazing how much fun they can have with such a simple toy.",5
The First Years Soft Teething Beads,My daughter loves this and it keeps her happy for a long time.  It is also very easy to wash to keep clean as well.,5
The First Years Soft Teething Beads,"My baby loves to play with this during bath time! It's easy for her to hold, bite and play with!",5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I bought this for my 8 week old daughter, we are planning a trip to Texas and did not want to take the heavy stroller...I tried her in the sling,she got very hot and because of that she got heat rash all over her face and neck (she was only in the sling for about 10 minutes)!!!! I did not like all the padding, it makes it to bulky! On top of all that it gave me a back ache!!If you are serious about a sling I would choose the Maya, it is a thinner material, and is not bulky at all. That is what I ended up buying, and my daughter loves it and so do I.",1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I thought this would be an excellent item to have. I was wrong! This is the most cumbersome thing I own and my son sweats like crazy in it. There's no support for the baby's neck or back, and I always feel like he's about to fall out of it. Unless you've got really strong shoulders or a feather-weight infant, you might want to skip the infant carrier thing completely. Save yourself time and money on this - I wouldn't buy it again!!",1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"It is a little awkward at first, but I had an extremely premature baby who was too small for the traditional carriers, and needed to be held all the time.  I lived, cooked, did laundry, ate, and slept with this sling for 2 months.  Once my baby was bigger and needed to be held less I started using other carriers.  But now I'm back to the sling because quite frankly, once you get the hang of it, its much, much easier to get baby in and out of it.",4
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I think the idea behind the sling is great but it is not for every baby.  Everytime our son is put in this he crys or screams.  He is an easy going fellow but he hasn't liked being held to closely.  He wants his freedom and this doesn't give much freedom to a newborn.  Also, the &quot;training&quot; video is more of a promotional advertisement.  I had to go to the web site to get more information about how to use it.",1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,This is a great product but it is just too big for me. If you are 5'5&quot; inch. and below please do not get this cause it will look like a sack on you.  My baby was terrified and looked uncomfortable in it. She cried everytime I put her inside. Practice makes perfect but eventually my baby &amp; I got tired of using this.,1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"After reading all the great reviews on the sling I decided to try one.  We both hated it. Maybe because I'm 5'1 and my son was eleven pounds when he was born made it more difficult. I kept trying to make it work for us but after 6 months I gave it up. I ended up giving it away. It's not one size fits all. If you're short, think twice on this.",2
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I used this sling for both of my babies, (0-&gt; 2.5yrs). We had a front backpack style which was good for about 3 months, until the weight of the baby started to make my back ache.The best thing about this sling, besides the fact that the kids loved riding in it, is that it folds up into a reasonably size bundle that fit in my diaper bag. So as the kids aged, and wanted to walk on their own I could just toss this carrier in the diaper bag for when they got tired. Also with the kid riding either in front or on your hip, they are very accessible, so that you can hand them something, like a bottle or a bit of food when you are on the go. (Say like walking around at the Zoo.)I must admit I liked the hip carry position best, it mimic's having my arm under their butt, and holds them close.Anyway its reasonably priced, you'll get your use out of it, (unlike the front only carriers, which as I mentioned aren't good for very long, or the backpack carriers, which while are good for that heavy load, don't pack up and so aren't with you when you need them.)",5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,My Grandson is super fussy and I used this for my own son. Put my Grandson in this turned on the vacuum and he was out like a light! He looked just like he was back in the womb!Thank goodness I still had this as it is no longer available. What a great product!,5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"Every time I hear a parent say that they tried a sling, but baby hated it, or it was a pain, or they just ended up not using it, this was the sling they tried.  People who love their slings used a Maya Wrap, Over the Shoulder Baby Holder, or New Native sling.  All of which come in great fabric choices and are easy to use.",1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I am the the mother of a 14 week old who has reflux and is uncomfortable sleeping in a crib or anywhere flat. She wants to be held *all* the time, and it was getting pretty exhausting in our arms (and my chronic tendonitis was flaring up) until we ordered the sling after reading about it in Dr. Sears's The Baby Book.  I had my doubts, but boy has it been a lifesaver!The sling has been invaluable for me, my husband, and our regular sitter. With it, we are able to walk, bounce, give the calming pinky finger treatment, and see what's going on with the baby. She started using the sling at 2 weeks, when she was about 7 pounds. It took a few times, but she is now completely comfortable in it and it is a favorite napping spot.As I am large-breasted, I did find it awkward to breastfeed in it, although I've been able to do it successfully a couple of times in public sitting down.  The fabric is soft and easily washable (important for those baby mishaps).  The padding helps me feel comfortable as a bit of protection in case of bumping.  The size is very adjustable for different height people, although you may need to pull through a lot of fabric to bring small babies in tightly, especially if you have a smaller chest size.The NoJo sling would benefit from having some loose fabric at the end to cover the baby's head in the sun and provide more coverage during breastfeeding. The stopper piece of plastic at the end of the fabric adds safety (it won't pull through), however it can whack the baby if you aren't careful when getting it on or off.  It could also use a zippered storage area, a feature of some other slings.  Also, the blue with plaid seems to be the only fabric sold these days, although I have seen other patterns and colors on eBay.  This is fine with jeans, but not great when you have to go to a wedding, as I did with the sling earlier this summer. I think it also makes people think that she's a boy, for some reason.  Maybe it's the blue and the fact that they can't see her cute dresses!The sling is also helpful in keeping interested strangers at a slight distance away from the baby -- they are less able to grab at her, which I think is good from a germ perspective, especially for newborns. When it is very hot or humid out, this sling can be a bit heavy for the baby (especially up against a hot mama!), but on cooler days the fabric adds just the right amount of warmth, like a light blanket.When I was pregnant, I assumed the Baby Bjorn would be all we would need. Instead it hangs on a hook most of the time unless we're going for a long walk or shopping -- activities where having two hands is important and you'll be doing them for a while. That thing is so hard to get on and off! Plus, you aren't supposed to use it until they are 8 lbs. The baby seems to really like the flexibility of positioning with the sling -- especially curling up happily in a womb-like ball -- and sometimes gets irritated by being all dangled out in the Bjorn.Carrying the baby in the sling makes you so much more mobile than using a stroller or lugging her around in her heavy carseat, so I use it whenever I anticipate being in public where they are stairs, space issues, or other impediments.  It's good for short shopping trips as well, especially if you're with a friend who can carry things or push a cart, both of which are harder to do with the sling on.She's also a million times more comfortable in the sling than in her car seat, where she often cries.  Our NoJo Babysling has been in constant use since it arrived, and ties the bouncy seat (where she mostly sleeps by day) as the best return on investment of any of the baby gizmos we bought.  Our sitter will often wear the baby for her entire nap. The sitter just sits (often in a rocking chair or porch swing to provide some more movement) and reads while the baby sleeps.One last thing that's great is that when the baby falls asleep, she can be laid down on the bed or bouncy chair and the sling just slips off the wearer without waking the baby.I did not watch the video, but did read the sling chapter in the Baby Book, which was helpful. We have recently started using the kangaroo (facing out) position as the baby loves looking at the outside world now. It's nice to have this sort of flexibility.  If you are getting tired carrying around your baby, and would like an extra hand free, a sling is a great investment and while not the most elegant, the NoJo is a good workhorse one to use on a daily basis.",5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I love Dr. Sear's books, but this baby sling is much too large!  I am a slightly small framed 5'5"" woman.  My 6'5"" husband wears this sling just fine.  But, for a sling to work for YOU, it MUST FIT properly!  I finally bought a sling that fit me when my son was over 1 year old.  I couldn't believe what a difference it made and felt so sad that I hadn't tried a different sling sooner. My son loves sitting in it on my hip and brings it to me whenever I am working in the kitchen. Try the Rosado sling or any other brand that comes in sizes and buy the size that fits your body!  You will really be able to enjoy the baby wearing experience that Dr. Sears recommends so highly!",2
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I think slings are some of the most useful items for babies. They make nursing so easy, even while walking around on the street or in a busy store. I love the Sears Library, so I thought the Sears NoJo sling would be great. While I did use it for a long time, and would still recommend it over a front or back carrier (at least for the first few months), I found that this sling was difficult to adjust and my baby seemed to disappear in the first month or so. For small babies I prefer a sling with no railings, and more adjustable. The New Native sling and many others offer this. I would shop around online, there are many better slings than this.",3
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"We purchased the Babysling when our daughter was 2 weeks old.  I was looking for a baby carrier that I could wear while nursing her that would be comfortable and discreet.  Initially, I found the sling very awkward to use.  I wasn't able to master nursing her in the sling until she was 2-3 months old.  However, as a carrier the babysling was great from the beginning.  Our daughter was colicy, and being able to put her in the sling all cozied up to either myself or my husband, hands free, was a God send.  This calmed her 90% of the time.  As the months went by, being able to wear her in the sling enabled me to get housework done without baby crying to be picked up - she was already up, and was able to be &quot;involved&quot; in my daily activities this way.There are many different ways to wear your baby in the sling, and that versatility has made it one of the best baby product purchases we made.  Our daughter is now 2 1/2 (30+ lbs.), and when she's having a rough &quot;toddler day&quot; will still occasionally ask for the sling.Be patient with the sling.  Practice with it, and if you can, find a friend who has used one successfully.  Dr. Sears also has a whole chapter on using a sling (any sling, not just this brand) in his book The Baby Book - great photos in there to help get the hang of things.One last remark... I have a friend who tried this sling and was unable to get it tight around her body (she's very petite).  There are other brands of slings (Maya Wrap, Over the Shoulder Baby Holder) that come in multiple sizes that might allow for a more customized fit.",5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"This sling is the third baby carrier I purchased, when the first two highly-promoted products were too uncomfortable.  My son was a premature baby who needed to be carried a lot for the first few months.  After we purchased this sling, my son basically lived in it!  The variety of cozy positions were perfect for his needs, and the sling fits so comfortably on both my husband and me that we don't even feel the weight of the baby when he's in it.  In fact, the weight of the baby is so evenly distributed that you don't develop the shoulder strain or lower back sway that other products gave us.  We would recommend this sling to anyone with a newborn or premature baby, and we continue to use it now that our son is a big 6-month old baby.  Buy it!",5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I got a regular carrier as a gift and I hated it! The baby would slide down in it, even though it says its for newborns. I have two other children and had to attend open house at two different schools. The first open house I had the baby in the carrier and it was awful. I ended up taking the baby out of it. My breastfeeding consultant told me about the sling an I went out and brought it right away. It is the best thing I could have ever got for myself and baby. The second open house was so much easier. The baby just bald up like in my womb and slept for the whole two hours. It was also great because I had both hands free to meet and greet the teachers. It comes in handy for breastfeeding discretly in public which for some moms is a must. The baby would sometimes get upset when taken out of the sling. I would recommend the sling to every mom every where!!!!!!",5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"My neighbor had the Nojo and liked it so I was going to get one too. I tried hers, but I couldn't get it tight enough so my baby hung down too low which didn't seem safe and hurt my back. I thought I could order a different size, but found it only comes in one size. I then read all the reviews here and followed someone's advice and ordered a from babymoon slings. It fit me better (I'm petite) and was a lot easier to use (and prettier!). I think it makes a big difference to get a sling that's not bulky and comes in sizes - I don't get why they use so much padding in the nojo, it makes it really hard to use with a newborn compared to other slings.",1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I have four children and have seen the benefits of the sling first-hand in varied situations.  My first was very small, and as a newborn, I thought he seemed lost in the sling so I exchanged it for a front-pack carrier.  Now I know that you can put a blanket or such in the sling to help cradle a newborn more securely.  It was a lost opportunity for us.  With the arrival of my second child, I decided to give it another try, as many of my friends raved about theirs and I'd need my hands free for my first child still.  I found the sling to be great for nursing, and afforded me privacy when I had to do so while out and about as I could pull the sling's fabric right over the baby and cover us both.  For a tired baby, it is much more conducive to sleeping than an upright carrier, and you can slip out of it and lay the baby down while still in the sling, if necessary.  My third child was (and still is) very cuddly, and enjoyed being next to me.  Since a mom's arms tire after a while, I found the sling a great way to incorporate baby into my routine without wearing myself out.  My fourth child turned our world upside-down with a very colicky start.  The &quot;insert-in-sling-and-go&quot; method was the only way to settle him down.  I could nurse, cook supper, do whatever I needed to do while keeping him close and moving, which was the key.  He learned to relax and even sleep while I was doing all sorts of things and making quite a racket at times.  Now at nearly three, he'll fall asleep while I'm driving and I can take him into the house, remove his coat and shoes, then carry him upstairs to bed without disturbing him.  I believe his learning to relax and sleep in the sling with so much going on around him has helped him in this area, too.  Most of all, it is just nice to have that close time with your little one in the sling, even if you are busy with other things to do.  I can't promise miracles, but this sling has been a crucial part of our early parenting and I recommend it highly!",5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I bought this babysling after reading about it in Dr. Sears' book.  My daughter was 2 months old and fussy!  Nothing seemed to work.  I was desperate!  Since the babysling was adjustable I thought it would fit all body types...not!  I am of average height but on the slimmer side.  It gave me alot of shoulder and back pain.  I rate this a one star because I found one use for it...I use it tied around my torso to carry my daughter on my back with the slight support of my hands. Back carrying is a bit tricky so don't try it alone!  I think baby slings are great but not this one is not for me.  If you are slimmer than average, try the New Native baby carrier.  It's portable and comes in different sizes.",1
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,I disagree with all of the reviews that say one size does not fit all. My Husbad is 6&quot;4 I am small frame 5&quot;2 and all we had to do when switching was move the adjustment. It was quite easy. We bought this after having the others. But they spread our daughter legs too far and she wanted to lie down at times not sit up. It was great because she could sit or lie down. And when she was very fussy it was the only way to get her to sleep. We then just slipped it off and put her down. IT was Great! Now that she is older I no longer use it but it was such a life saver I could not bring myself to get rid of it.  I not only recomend this but Dr. Sears book to anyone who has a fussy baby.,5
"Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Original Bassinet, Solid Toffee","I love the idea of the co-sleeper. I've seen some other concept designs by other companies and I hope they follow through with them. Arm's Reach has a bit of a monopoly on the co-sleepers right now. My little one hasn't arrived yet, so I haven't actually used it yet. Assembly is REALLY confusing. I don't know what happened to my paper instructions, but I can't find them. Luckily, there are some on the AR web page. But it is still so confusing.For those of us who are ardent Attachment Parenting, this is ideal. My older son, 15 months old, is still in bed with us and this Arm's Reach will give us the extra space for two little ones. We used the Snuggle Nest when our older boy was a small infant and that worked great. With two though, I wanted to keep the older away from the younger while they slept but still near us.If attachment parenting is a new concept for you, I strongly encourage you to read as much as you can online. Arm's Reach co-sleeper is a great way to co-sleep without the fear of suffocation.",4

Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,"This is a horrible product - because the base of the bar is round, it doesn't attach properly to a stroller, and it keeps sliding forward or back, thus losing all the snacks in the cup.  They need to redesign it with a flat base.  There is one company that has one with the flat base - it's made by Kids11, Inc -and my daughter LOVES IT!  Don't waste your money on this one - you, and your little one will just be frustrated!",1
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,"This toy was a waste of my money.  It did not fit on my stroller without some modification and even then, it didn't stay put.  It would not stay upright when my daughter played with it.  And it had a removable piece in it.  Needless to say, it was not a piece my daughter at the time knew how to put in and out.  And on top of that, she decided that she'd rather play with the removable plastic piece than the toy itself!  Also, my stroller would not fold up with this on (oh yea, my stroller is a name brand stroller too).  I would have to remove it everytime i folded it up.  Needless to say, I did that about twice and then tossed the toy in the trash.",1

I had no idea the ladybug on it was a snack holder, I wouldn't be putting anything in there, The stroller I have the Tray comes off so I just put the toy on it without the tray. but it the straps do loosen up on it, so I am every once in awhile Straightening it.I do reccomend the toy to anyone who has a baby like my daughter! i'm very happy with the toy!",5

I give this product 3 stars because my son did like to play with it but, thats really the only good thing.",3
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,"I bought this on a whim to keep my 4 month old happy in his stroller.  Otherwise, I would be holding him while pushing the stroller!  Well - he is now 9 1/2 months old and STILL loves it!  He bites on the wings of the bee and chews on the bug attached with fabric.  He doesn't ever seem to tire of this toy and I've been on marathon shopping sessions with him lasting a few hours!!  I would recommend this to everyone as one of the must haves for under 12 months!",5
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,"I bought this for my son when he was 4 months. He is now 11 months and is not that enthused with it anymore. I liked this product because of the bright colors and the variety for him to play with. It is a very good toy, but my son doesn't have much interest in it. Nothing at all wrong with the toy, I would recommend it to anyone.",4
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,This toy is very cute and I personally love Sassy products but I found this to be a hazard as well as a waste.  First of all the butterfly hits my children in the face and has hurt their mouth as well not to mention it does not fit properly on a stroller.,1
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,"This toy is so nice to have if you use your stroller a lot. My baby has loved playing with this and I have even given this as a gift. The only thing that I did not like was that the cup that is the bugs legs, comes out. That is great for cleaning but if the baby takes it out, it can become yet another thing to keep track of during your ever so busy outings. Overall, this is a great and cute idea and gives some added fun for babies stroller time.",4
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,"We have this stroller bar and it ABSOLUTELY fits on the Graco strollers!  We have the Graco Quattro Tour system and this toy bar has been on it since we took my son out of the car seat carrier.  You need to put the velcro on off to the side and then slide it on to the main section of the snack tray.  It takes maybe 1-2 minutes to attach and then you never need to touch it again.  My son loved to look at it when he was 4 months and loves to play with it now that he is one year old.  The only complaint that I have about this toy is that the snack cup bug comes with an insert that is supposed to look like legs when the cup is closed.  It tends to fall out so i just took it off the toy.  Other than that, this is a great product and will occupy your child during long stroller trips.",5
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,Baby loved this but the only problem is the straps that tie it to the stroller are not big enough for some trays. Due to this my first one came un-sewed and I had to buy another one and the same thing happened again.,3
Sassy Busy Bugs Bar,"Once my daughter started teething, the paint started coming off &amp; it was only when we found some on her lip that we realized.  We have not used it since &amp; had only been using the bar for a couple of months.I worry about such things as 'paint eating' &amp; consider the possible risks to be too concerning to rate this product any higher than 1*.Best wishes.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Ok - newsflash.  Diapers are just smelly.  We've had this pail for 2.5 years now.  It was our first and primary one.  There were no major smell problems until after one year, when our son started eating solids.  Also, we change the bag twice weekly as 3 days is about the max for smell-containment.  Around 20-22 months we started shopping for a container that would be less smelly and didn't find one as good.  (We have a cheaper one upstairs which broke immediately and always stunk!)  We finally just put the Diaper Champ in the attic a few months ago and use the cheap one with the flip-up lid - mainly since the cheapo fits inside the cabinet and we didn't notice a big difference in smell-control.  (The most helpful action is to tie the dirty diapers inside a small plastic bag before putting them in the pail.)A couple of our friends have this pail and were pleased until the children started eating solid food and things got stinkier - but that's pretty much the consensus according to many reviews on the different pails.  I've knocked off a star since the mechanism isn't that intuitive (to grandmothers and babysitters, at least) and it frequently gets stuck when the bag starts getting full.  Plus there are some smell issues, as with any pail.  However, the fact that you can use regular trash bags is so much more convenient!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is a good product to start and very easy to use.  But as baby gets older and begins solid foods, it is not effective as an odor controlling pail.  It is simply a place to put dirty diapers.  My daughter is now 10 months old and we had to remove the Diaper Champ from her nursery because it smells too bad.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband and I selected the Diaper ""Champ"" mainly because you can use ordinary trash bags and not be roped into buying the specialty refill bags, and it was moderately priced (a little less than the Diaper Dekor). It also seemed that the reviews of this product were generally more positive...The positives are:1. You can use any trash bag2. Easy to use and refillThe negatives are:1. The bag doesn't seal around the dirty diapers, so when it comes time to refill the bag, it's just like opening a regular trash can. Smells like the Champ is trying to knock YOU out with odor!2. The plastic seems to smell, ie. You put a dirty diaper in the hole, and flip the handle to dump the diaper into the champ. That ""side"" of the plastic dumper-thingie is in contact with the air inside the dirty diaper changer, so when you flip it over the next time to dispose of another diaper, you smell the last 8 diapers you put in there...pretty gross.3. The ""odor seal"" (some soft material) really seems to retain odor. It cannot be washed or replaced, so after a while, the Diaper ""Champ"" smells even when freshly washed and deodorized (I'm talking about hosing down outside and scrubbing with Clorox cleanser!). Super-frustrating! This is my primary complaint.Okay, so some things are a given as far as disposal systems go (ie. *some* odor, must empty frequently, must wash and disinfect occasionally), but still I think this product leaves much to be desired.We're going to try another disposal system.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,Excellent diaper disposal unit.  I used it in conjunction with Glad 3ply kitchen trash bags with odor control (scented).  I am soooo pleased with this product!!! A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We love our diaper champ.  It is very easy to use just drop the diaper in and flip the top over.  No need to stick your hand inside.  No hint of an odor, even when you are putting another dipaer in.  When it gets full, just put in a new trash bags.  The best feature of all is that even the most curious little ones can't get into the diapers.  Before we found the diaper champ, we had another diaper pail and our son learned to open it and pull the diapers out.  That is no longer a problem!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Two girlfriends and two family members put me onto this diaper pail.  They each had tried the Diaper Genie and had horrible results with eventual smells, and costliness of buying proprietary DG cartridges.  My family members eventually started bringing every dirty diaper out to the trash and leaving just wet diapers in the DG, that is until they found out about the Diaper Champ!Wow, what a difference, it seals in orders very well and using normal 8 - 13 gallon trash bags makes it economical.  The ease of use factor is amazing, drop a dirty diaper in the hole, grab the handle, give it a flip, the plunger pushes the diaper down and it drops into the can with a little gravitic help.No wrenching, turning, fighting a cartridge bag system.Opening it for the first time was a little hard, but look at that from a child's point of view, a toddler is not going to get into it, and neither is a dog.  Also, it needs to be away from the wall a little bit, so that it's flip top access lid locks into place and doesn't plop back down, but when engaged, the top will stay open so you can get at the bag of diapers within without having it fall onto your hand.We keep a little can of Oust nearby, spritz it before opening the top, grab the bag at it's neck to close off stinky odors, lift it out, twist it at the top and secure it with a twist-tie, and away we go to the garbage can.  And we take antibacterial wipes and run them around in the plunger area on both sides, voila, it's clean.At 3 months, we change the bag about 1 - 2 times a week.  Maybe as baby grows into larger diapers it will be more like 2 - 3 times a week.Still, that's better than taking every dirty diaper (8 or more a day) outside to the garbage can, especially in a Minnesota winter.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I waited to review this until I saw how it performed in the really-stinky-diaper stage.  Now, with my daughter at 1 year and eating lots of solids (and making really stinky diapers), I can happily recommend the diaper champ.  A couple suggestions: 1) as baby's poop gets stinkier, empty more often (at least once a week) and 2) every time you empty, spray with Lysol or similar product and wipe out with antibacterial cleaner.  This second step has kept the plastic from retaining a bad smell.I gave 4 stars because it's not ""perfect"" -- sometimes a little smell leaks out if it's very full.  But all around a good product, and not needing special refill bags is a huge benefit for a busy mom.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have had a diaper genie for almost 4 years since my first son was born and I have been using it with my second as well.  I thought I'd try the champ to save $ on the genie refills.  Well it is not a $ saver because it does not hold the odor inside so I was constantly changing the trash bags.  The diaper genie is not odorless, but it does a much better job of keeping the room fresh smelling for a longer period before you have to empty it.  The champ is just like a regular trash can with a lid-just looks fancier.  I suppose you could use it as a regular trash can in your child's room-they wouldn't be able to get into it!  Don't waste your $ to ""save"" $!  Buy the genie-your nose will thank you!!  Also, if you don't keep the dirty wipes enclosed in the diaper, they get this thing all dirty and you have to clean it! YUCK!",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.  I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.  Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!! I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'  In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!  I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week.  For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!! Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!!  Hello, it does house dirty diapers!! All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.  SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful.  Again, this is because as their diet changes, so does the consistency and odor of their stool, in other words, it gets stinkier!!!All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I am so glad I got the Diaper Champ instead of the Diaper Genie!  You can use pretty much any plastic bag - even a grocery bag will do in a pinch.  My baby is 6 weeks and I have never smelled any odors at all from the Champ.  I especially like the way you close it - you just flip the handle and that's it.  The Champ is definitely the best.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,We had 2 diaper Genie's both given to us as a gift but it was hard to use it since everytime you stuff the diaper in you have to turn it which cannot be done with one hand (required if you are holding your baby).  Also everytime you dispose your diaper it smells even when you are careful to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag before disposing.  On top of that the refills are very expensive.  So we decided to buy Diaper Champ and so far we love it.  It is very easy to use with one hand.  I like the feature that you can acutally clean the chute if for some reason it gets messy.  Also it does not smell everytime you dispose off the diaper but when you change the bag you have to hold your breath for that much time (the only down side and the reason for a 4 star rating) but I can handle it and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone.  It is very easy to use and does not smell unless the bag needs to be replaced and the most important part is that you can use your regular garbage bags (no need for expensive refills).,4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"When shopping around for a diaper pail I was drawn to the Diaper Champ for several reasons. 1) I loved the idea of using regular plastic bags from the grocery store. 2) The one-hand chute is quick and easy to use while dealing with a squirming baby. 3) I'd heard negative reviews about the Diaper Genie. Now that I've had the Diaper Champ for 8 months, I'm looking for a diaper pail that lives up to its name.About 2 months ago the chute began to stick and the pail began to release unpleasant fumes each time I'd drop a diaper in. The inner lining had come loose and was preventing diapers from dropping down into the bag. Eventually, the lining just fell out and that's when the smell became unbearable. Not only is my daughter's nursery filled with odors strong enough to give you a headache, the smell is seeping into the hall and down the stairs.Our Diaper Champ is on its way to the recycle bin. It won't be returning for a come-back fight.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is the very best. So much better than Diaper Genie. No doubt about it. I would never buy Diaper Genie again. As a matter of fact I threw them out. Here you have No Refills to buy, much easier to empty and put in a new garbage bag, a lot cheaper and most of all a lot quieter. The Diaper Genie is so loud when putting in a diaper in the middle of the night that is a pain. I highly recommend this product. In regards to smell?.....excuse me there are diapers in there, not roses. Like the lady below said a Clorox wipe with some Lysol and your set to go. If you're still picky put in an airfreshner.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We bought this pail because it used regular trash bags and hoped it lived up to all it says - IT DOES!!  We use the scented trash bags and have had no trouble at all!  (It does get a little smelly when you change the bag, but that is expected)The only thing we don't like is the inside lid that holds the bag down. It does not stay up on its own.  So when you change bags it has to be held open with 1 hand-leaving only 1 hand to get the bag out.  It just makes it akward.My husband even recommends it!!  So it has to be good.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"While pregnant with my son I reviewed all the diaper pails and found the diaper champ to be the most reasonable.  I liked the idea of no costly refills and it was only a couple more dollars than the diaper genie.  It was easy to put together, however it is difficult to open and empty.  My son is now 13 months old and the odor is noticeable.  Even the pail itself stinks regardless of how often I scrub it ( I even use scented trash bags).  With dirty diapers you do have to expect some smell, I mean it comes with the territory, however I have to keep an air freshner plugged into the wall to help combat the smell. It worked well for the first few months, but now I end up having to change the bags before they are even half full, which really seems like a waste.  I am now expecting my second baby and am considering a different pail this time.If you are on a tight budget as I was the first go around, the diaper champ works, but if you can afford the few extra dollars and the refills, I would definately spend the extra money.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have not used this item yet for diapers, but as for my first inspection upon receiving this as a gift...I found that every time I moved the handle at the top, the unit wobbled due to the poor design- large at the top with a small base.  I noticed that some online stores sell a new and improved design that has a larger base at the bottom- I purchased the newer model and no longer have the wobble problem.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Diaper Champ or Diaper Genie? That was my dilemma when registering for gifts before my son was born. Lucky for me, I had my Mom with me. She runs a daycare and said Diaper Champ is the best by far and that's what I went with. The fact that you can use regular trash bags instead of special cartridges was very appealing to me. Now my son is 6 months old and I must say this thing is GREAT! The only time I catch any smell at all is when I change trash bags. I use those Glad trash bags that are scented to prevent odors and that makes a difference, too. it is very easy and covenient to use and I highly recommend it. The only thing you need to watch is the opening latch is a bit tricky (I broke a nail the first time I used it, but then I got the hang of it). I am glad for this, though, because if it's not easy for me to open, it won't be for my son, either.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! It is SO much easier to use than the Diaper Genie, (you need a PHD in poopy to figure out how to use the darn thing!) and it even takes the same bags as my kitchen trash can, shich is super convenient, and cost efficient as I can buy them in bulk.The only reason for not rating it a 5 star was that I did have one small problem with it. The foam gasket in the barrell which keeps the poopy smell inside the unit ripped somehow, and it got VERY stinky. HOWEVER, I contacted the manufacturer though their website, and received an email back the same day stating that this was unusual, and that replacement gaskets were on their way to me. They arrived inside of a week and after replacing, it works great again! (They even sent me extras should it happen again)I HIGHLY reccomend this diaper pail over ANY competitors, you will not be sorry!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Although I had a Diaper Genie from my first child, which I hated, I registered for this for my second.  I received very few items from my registry but this was by far the best gift I received overall. It is very easy to operate.  My 4 year old feels a part of the diaper changes because he can work it.  It keeps the smell out which makes mom and dad happy.  But, by far the best thing about the Diaper Champ is that it takes regular trash bags so you don't have to worry if [the store] will have the refills.  It is definately a people pleaser!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Granted our 3-month old isn't producing really stinky diapers yet, but the Champ is much better than using a trash can.  My only issue is that its hard to flip the handle over using one hand - kind of a must when holding on to a squirmy infant.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We loved this pail at first. The mechanism seemed ingenius, and we appreciated that it took regular bags. But once our daughter started to stand up, that big white handle was irresistable to her, and before we even realized it, she started flipping it. That makes the heavy center portion slide back and forth FAST, and sure enough she caught her finger and started yowling.This was *not* an isolated incident -- if you play with the pail a little bit, you'll quickly see that the mechanism is a total finger trap for toddlers. Worse yet, they can slam a finger then hurt it seriously in their attempts to get it free by pushing the handle the wrong way. It's really pretty scary.You'll notice that the positive reviews here generally say ""I've been using this for two months, and it's great!"" But once you have older babies, I'd retire it pronto.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I bought this for my church nursery room. At home we use the First years product, which isn't bad but not as good as this one.There are a couple of occasions that dirty diapers were left in it for a week but i didn't know because it didn't smell till I opened it to change the garbage bag.I think this is the only diaper pail that is cheap to use yet does the job well.Highly recommend.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I recently gave birth to my third child.  When I had my 1st 11 years ago, I got a Diaper Genie and it worked okay, but the stupid refills for it were so expensive that I soon gave up on it.  Not to mention that the ""sausage links"" of diapers it created were pretty gross and I still had to use a garbage bag to dispose of them.  With this baby, I decided to give the Diaper Champ a try.  I LOVE IT!  In fact, I am considering buying one for my church's nursery, after having to smell a pretty foul diaper from one of the other babies there.  I agree with any reviews that suggest using scented garbage bags, as it DOES smell pretty awful when you empty it, and I think the scented bags would help that a little.  So far I have had only a minor complaint, and that is that it can be a little tricky to open sometimes, but overall it's still a great product.  I would definitely buy this again and recommend to a friend.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Our daughter is 13 months old and we've been using the Diaper Champ ever since she was born. I highly recommend it because it's a great value.  However, there are a few things to be aware of which is why I only gave 4 stars.1. Make sure the grip part of the diaper is not loose when placed in the DC. My husband learned the hard way that the grips get stuck on the seal and the diaper won't drop into the bag.  Then you have to pull the diaper out and the grips slowly pull away the seal.  It didn't seem to affect the odor control, but it did make it difficult to move the handle/shoot back and forth.  The company does send free replacement seals and instructions if you call and ask.2. The unit is top heavy when it's empty. I learned this one the hard way.  When pulling out a full bag of diapers be sure to put your foot on the base to keep it from banging you in the shin as it falls backward.  Ouch!!3. No, the stink isn't completely trapped, but it's pretty darn close! The stinkiest part is emptying a full bag.  I found that putting a stick-up inside the lid has made it much more tolerable.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband & I had received a tip from another parent that this was the must have item.  I had always hated that the diaper genie had to have special bags, I was just going to get a regular garbage pail & use that.  That is until we heard about the Diaper Champ.I absolutely love it.  It is a complete life saver all around.  No special bags to buy, not a hassle to put together.  Comes almost all the way assembled out of box just attach to base & voila you are ready to start changing diapers.  A little tip to keep the odor down.  I wipe it out with antibacterial wipes a couple of times a wk, & I spray Lysol disinfecting spray.  Once a month I wash it out with a mild dishwashing detergent.  Also, to give it a little good smell I buy a 2 pk of stick-ups(.97 cents at Wal-Mart) & stick one in the bottom of the pail.You will not go wrong betting on this one.  It is a sure winner.  You'll save a lot of money by using this one.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I don't know how we survived the first year without the Diaper Champ.  My daughter is now 13 1/2 months old and we still have an odor free nursery.  It's very economical, too.  Using regular kitchen bags and holding more diapers than the competing diaper disposal system makes this quite efficient.A trick that was passed down to me from an experienced mom to control odor (again, yes, it's going to smell a little...you put stinky diapers in it!):  Place a Bounce dryer sheet in the bottom of the pail (before putting the trash bag in)and spray thoroughly with Lysol after each use.  I don't know why the dryer sheet works...but it does!  And if I don't change it out regularly (about once every few weeks) then I start to notice the smell.Recommended above all other diaper pails!  Price-wise the Diaper Champ just can't be beat.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We originally had the diaper genie which we found to be a pain after the top broke off twice and all those replacement specialty bags we had to buy were getting expensive but not controlling the odors.  All that sausage shaped smelly garbage eeeewwww had to be put in another garbage bag just to get it out of the house!  My sis-in law had the diaper champ & I couldn't believe she even had any dirty diapers around...there was no smell!  We chucked the genie and bought the champ. It was so much easier to use...just roll the diaper into a little ball and drop into the hole on top, flip the handle and bye bye smelly diaper (my 16 month old can do it) And there were no special bags to buy, just the same regular garbage bags we used already in the kitchen. Experienced parents will understand and appreciate that it comes apart for easier cleaning for those times when it may become a mess.  We had a problem with odors after about a year of use so I called BabyTrend to see what they recommended.  They sent me these replacement sponge gaskets (free of charge) and we were once again odor free. Now on my 3rd child and almost 3 years later, I just called them again to get another set of replacement gaskets (again free of charge) they will be here in about a week.  THIS IS A GREAT ITEM and the company stands behind their product (even years later!)",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I didn't want to get the Diaper Genie because of the expensive refills needed to use the product.  The Diaper Champ uses 10 or 13 gallon trash bags (or you can recycle larger store bags to use in the Champ).  The mechanism doesn't let odors out and if you have toddlers that get into everything, they can't get into the Diaper Champ!  Opening the Diaper Champ is easy but could be an initial challenge for some but once you figure it out it's simple to open.  I highly recommend the Diaper Champ.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I wasn't sure which to get between this and the Diaper Genie. I am so glad that I chose this one. I love that I can buy the scented bags of my choice. It really holds in the horrible diaper smell. I love it and wouldn't trade it in for anything.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I chose the Diaper Champ over the Diaper Genie because of its money-saving feature of being able to accomodate most plastic bags with handles.  (The Genie requires use of their own bags.)  The plastic bags that work best are the larger kinds like the ones you get from Toys R Us or Ikea.  The plastic supermarket bags are a little too small.In regards to odor control, the DC has been successful for 3/4 of the year.  There is a noticeable smell during the summertime, so I've had to change the bags more frequently on hot days or else face the consequence of suffering the aroma of baking poop.My only negative comment about this product is concerning the lid.  For those who take great pride in your manicured nails, ask someone else to open it for you.  Even though I have short, uncared for nails, I've had a few bent nails from trying to pull open the lid.  Then, the next problem is that the lid doesn't open all the way (like a cigarette lighter).  It opens up to about a 75 degree angle.  This makes it inconvenient when you are trying to remove a stuffed bag of diapers.  Also, the underside of the lid has several plastic sharp juttings against which my hands would occasionally get scratched.  And, during the removal of the full bag, this is when you get the full blast of your little one's excretions (quite possibly 3-5 days worth of them), so hold your breath!Although there is room for improvement on this design, I haven't seen or heard of any other model that can do this job nearly as well for as reasonable a price.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Bad construction is my main issue. My husband assembled it and when changing the bag, you're supposed to open up the top head part which tilts back.  There's a little plastic tab that's suppused to slide in as your opening the top, but instead it get's cought so it allows the top to open up only partially. It may just be one defective item that somehow passed the quality control inspection, but I've given up on diaper pails in general.  Talking to 1st time parents, I found out that almost everyone gets one, but almost everyone stops using them very quickly.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I was very happy with the Diaper Champ for a long time. I loved being able to use regular garbage bags, changing the bags was easy, and easy to empty. Very simple to put the diapers in. We did have to replace the sponge ""gaskets"" twice before putting the Diaper Champ to the curb. Once our child was on table foods this diaper pail does not work anymore! Even with cleaning it and letting it air out for a day. It literally made the whole house stink!So out to the curb it went and got something else. There is absolutely no smell w/ the different diaper pail.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is on my list of must haves.  The thing has been in my bedroom for 6 months.  Not once have I ever smelled an odor from this thing.  I love that I can use any kind of bag so I just buy those super cheap super flimsy tall size garbage bags.The only drawback, as with all diaper pails, is that as the baby gets bigger and the diapers get bigger, you have to change the bag more often.  Our baby is 6 months and we fill it about once every 36 hours.But still, I wouldn't trade it for the world.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Diaper catches and jams in the well and that is particularly nasty when the diaper is dirty.  Also, it is impossible to get it 100% clean after such a jam, which causes the oder to persist.  I have given up and am now throwing my Diaper Champ away and getting something new.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love the convenience of not having to buy special bags.  I got my Diaper Champ as a hand-me-down from a relative, and it still works great.  There is no diaper odor in our nursery.  When you change the bag, get in there with some Lysol spray and eliminate the germs and the residual odor (hello, if you didn't flush the toilet for a week it would stink, too - try changing the bag before it's overflowing!).If you don't clean things, they don't smell clean.  This isn't rocket science.The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because I don't like the opening mechanism on the front.  But I can't think of any way they could've done it differently that would be as effective.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I've been using this diaper pail for 2 and 1/2 years and I LOVE it.  I can buy inexpensive scented bags from the grocery store and I just use recycled grocery bags to wrap-up the poopie ones.  My son's room has NEVER smelled at all!I do lysol it every once in a while.  But that's all I've had to do.When I'm at friends' houses that have the diaper genie, I've been confused about how to use it.  No one has ever been confused about how to use ours.  Just put it in and flip.I have recommended this to all of my friends and family.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"It suprises me to read all of these reviews saying that the diaper pail stinks up a room!  DUH! It's full of dirty diapers.  Personally, we never had that problem too much.  The nursery smells a bit sometimes but I think you would have that with every diaper pail.We got this one because we use cloth diapers and don't want each one mummified in it's own cocoon.  I used this for my first two kids.  We threw it out when we moved but now that the third is here we are going to get a new Diaper Champ.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Diaper Champ is great.  But just to let you know that I've been breastfeeding and the poop doesn't stink as much as formula poop.  So I can't tell you if Diaper Champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell, but it's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I registered for the Diaper Champ after seeing the reviews and I cannot talk enough about it. I just live it!!! It is odorless(so far) and very easy to use - and only with one hand, so you can SAFELY keep the other one on your baby. It's very easy to change the bags, which you can use any 13 gallons one - no expensive refills to buy!!!! I just sprinkle some scented baby powder or spray some Lysol Disinfectant spray everytime I change a bag, to keep it from smelling even a little bit.I highly recommend the Champ, you will not regret it!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,You really can not appreciate this device until you've used it.No smell unless you don't empty it for a week or more. An airtight vault it's not....but it does what it's designed to do very well.Who doesn't take out the trash more than once a week ? Same concept with this diaper pail.- From a Dad of a Newborn who's thankful he ignored the negative reviews.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I am glad my friend told me about the diaper champ, because otherwise I would have gone in for the diaper genie. This is cheaper than the genie for one, and works just as well in terms of trapping odor. It is also bigger than the genie, and the best part is, you can use regular garbage bags in them. Isn't that just PERFECT? Love this product, and would highly recommend it to any parents-to-be.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"In reading some of the other reviews, I think it's all been said but I guess I'll say it again anyway.  :)  I love the Diaper Champ - you can operate it with one hand (allowing you a free hand to hold down a squirming baby on the changing table), no special bags to purchase, and odor-free if you stay on top of changing the bag and spraying with Lysol every few bag changes.  My husband and I tend to let it get to the point that we have to actually push the plunger down to get the diaper to go in and still the nursery is odor-free for playing or sleeping.  And I must admit, I have a 1 yr. old who eats everything under the sun and even when it comes time to change the bag, it's not that bad.  Tie it up fast and you're good to go. ;)  I will admit that it can be hard to open, but if it were easier, I'd have dirty diapers strung from one end of the room to the other because of my busy boy!!!  I highly recommend the Diaper Champ!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I Loved this product. It kept smell to a minimum and could use a regular size trash bag.  Highly  recommend.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"After 2 and half years I still can't get the smell out. Its been sitting outside airing out for 3 months now, I think thats where I'm leaving it too. I love the concept of a diaper champ, but somebody do something about the smell, please.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This product meets all my expectations. The diaper champ is easy to put together. It keeps odors in the container. Most importantly it uses regular 13 gallon bags! By the way, keep a roll of these at the bottom of the container for that day when it fills up.  Depending on your use you could go for a week without emptying it out.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is the worst diaper pail ever!  It was great for the first couple weeks, but then it began to smell.  I cleaned the inside and outside with 409 again and again, but the smell would return with the first diaper I put in.  Then to make matters worse my 16 month old figured out it was fun to put toys in the hole where you put the diapers and try to flip it the way I did with his dirty diapers.  I had a Diaper Genie that broke and was hopeful that this less complicated diaper disposal system would work as well, but it does not!",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I purchased this pail about a year ago and found out right away that it will not control Ordor for #2 diapers.  My cat box smells fresher!  So, I used it for wet diapers only until I found that my now 1 1/2 year old son makes is own deposits...his toys!  Oh and by the time the pail fills up with wet diapers, those smell too.  The bag gets heavy and awkward to pull out if you don't have good upper body strength or a bad lower back.  So, the pail is now in our storage unit and we have a wicker basket with a lid (found free at a garage sale) lined with a garbage bag that sits on our deck right outside the sliding glass door. Diaper deposits are made there where it is easy to get too, the smell is outside and it can be emptied by my husband...outside!",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is my first baby so I have nothing to compare this product to. But I have heard horror stories of stinky diaper pails. My baby is now six months old and the only time I smell her diapers is when I change them and when I open the pail to replace the bag! I use the same garbage bags that I use in my 13-gallon kitchen trash can! It's so simple and user-friendly it's ridiculous! Put in a trash bag, old plastic grocery bag, yard waste bag, whatever; put down the top, you're ready to go. The top acts like a chute and whisks the dirty diaper away. When full pop the top (hold your breath), pull out the bag and put in a new one. No jamming or any other kind of technical difficulty whatsoever! And, again, no leaking smells. Don't waste your money on anything else!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"As new parents, we started out with the Diaper Genie because everyone told us that we just *HAD* to have one.  While the Genie did a decent job at keeping the odors inside (except when emptying it!), it was a pain in the neck for older family members to use (e.g. grandparents) and those refill cartridges start to add up after a while!A friend with a child the same age as mine showed me her Diaper Champ and I was thoroughly impressed!  Not only did it do a comparable job at keeping odors inside, it was extremely easy to use and did not require me to spend an additional [$$$] each month on refills.  We decided to go ahead and buy a Diaper Champ because our son was only 13 months old and we figured he'd be in diapers for at least another year so we'd be saving money after 6 months by not having to buy the refill cartridges.  Then when our twins were born, we were so glad that we had the Champ!  After all, we're already buying tons of diapers, who needs to spend another [$$$] a month on those Genie cartridges?!As for ease of use, my 3.5-year-old son loves throwing the dirty diapers away for me because all you have to do is drop it into the chamber and flip the lid.  It is super easy to empty it too.  And I've found that if I use scented garbage bags and give the inside a quick spray with Lysol each time I empty it, the smell when emptying it is not as bad as it is with the Genie.I HIGHLY recommend the Diaper Champ!  And even if you already have a Genie, if your child is going to be in diapers for more than 6 more months, go out and get a Champ because you'll be saving money in the long run by not having to buy any more refill cartridges!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I found this pail to be heavy without anything in it.  I found that it took up too much space.  I find myself using a regular small garbage pail and I don't smell any odors (and all of my windows are closed).  dislike the mechanism for opening this pail, when I opened this pail for the first time, I broke two of my nails, I tried opening again and it was still hard on the fingers and nails. My son is only two months and perhaps I need a diaper pail later on, but for right now, I am going to use a regular garbage pail.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,Can't get the smell of rank diapers out of the top(cover) of the Diaper Champ. Any better models out there?,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband and I love the Diaper Champ. It holds a nice amount of diapers,contains the odor and it uses your own garbage bags. The Diaper Champ is easy to use and to empty, it really is a wonderfully designed product.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,We originally registered and received the safety 1st pail- what a disappointment.  the latch never worked- we purchased this pail and what a wonder!  my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops).  I have recommended this pail to all my friends and they love it as well!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I was told not to waste my money on a diaper pail because it didn't do what it claimed to do.  Finding out it was a genie diaper pail I read the reviews of the diaper champ and decided to try the champ.  I couldn't have spent my money any wiser. Their is never an odor and I always wait until it is completely full.  Convenience of not buying new bags is wonderful!!  This is great for my 10 week baby's room-Love it!!!!!!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"With my second child I wanted something better than the Diaper Genie which I did not like at all, it was smelly and impossible to do with a one hand action.  Enter the Diaper Champ! After reading all of the customer reviews here I decided to try it and everyone was so right.  I can put poopie diapers in this diaper pail and it doesn't smell at all! It holds a sufficient amount of diapers and needs no special bags, just regular garbage bags. I has an easy one hand action to deposit the dirty diapers leaving one hand free to hold the baby with. I am totally pleased with the Diaper Champ and hope everyone gives it a try, its worth the money!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Let me just say, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!  I used the diaper genie from the time my daughter was born until the time she was 16 months.  That was all I could take.  Constantly buying expensive refills, emptying it every couple of days, juggling a wiggly baby while trying to open, lift, push, spin, and close the genie was just too much.  Then I was shopping at Babies R Us and in the STORE's changing room is the Diaper Champ.  It was easy, didn't smell, and used regular trash bags.  I was sold.After using the Diaper Champ for 2 months now, I am confident I made the right choice.  Yes, when it gets too full, you have to change the bag or the weight will get stuck (duh!).  Yes, if you don't wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).  Yes, poop does smell (not like roses), but my daughter's room doesn't smell like poop because the Diaper Champ does a great job of containing odor.  You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.  It is fantastic!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is amazing! We can toss tons of diapers (abouth 5 days diapers for a new born). And there is NO smell at all. I do recommend the following: Close well each diaper with the velcro, you'll be able to fit more diappers. And occasionally clean the tube where the diaper is toss with baby wipes, then toss the wipe. Somehow when you open the diaper champ to replace teh bag, you smell more wipes than stools!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We wanted to have a convenient locking receptable for poop-laden diapers in our toddler's bedroom. While they do lock, they aren't convenient. Wipes get caught in the mechanism and you have to shake and bang it while trying to keep wriggling baby on the changing table. Poop gets into the chamber, and smears on the outside of the rotating drum, particularly when they get too full, which they do often. They're bigger than diaper genies, yes, but not quite big enough for a baby with a big appetite.This smearing problem, is, in my opinion, probably the source of the smell that others complain of. We have cured the smell by keeping handy a container of bleach-wipes, and frequently wiping thoroughly in and out of the drum. What a hassle!Our recommendation: buy a tall trash barrel with a foot lever, and if your toddler gets curious attach an appliance latch. You'd need to open the latch before starting the change, and close it after, but that seems easier to me than thumping and wiggling a diaper champ in the middle of the change. It will control odors better, and you won't have to be continually wiping poop off the outside of it.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I wasn't interested in getting the Diaper Genie because those sausage baggy things were too much of a pain!  Plus they can get expensive when you're having to change your baby 8 times a day and you have to buy refills for it.  When I first saw the Diaper Champ and read what you needed for it and what it did, there was no question that I wanted it!  It's awesome!  When they say it's odorless, it REALLY is.  The only time you ever smell anything is when you open the lid to empty it and all the dirty diapers are right there.  You never smell anything when it's closed.  Plus, I like the fact that you don't have to buy refill bags for it.  It takes the plastic grocery store bags that everyone has too many of.  I recommend this for anyone who is looking for a very convenient and odorless diaper pail!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I checked out all of the available diaper disposal systems.  This by far is the best, no refillable special bags, no stink, and very easy to use.  It is great! Those exploding diapers for newborns can't even crack this.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This diaper pail has NO ODOR and is the perfect size.  I use normal 10-gallon trash bags from Target.  No complaints at all!  Very easy to use and seriously, you do not smell any poopy diapers!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love the diaper champ for how many diapers it holds and the fact you don't have to buy special bags for it, but it doesn not keep in the odors. I feel like I have to change the bag more often so I don't know how much I'm really saving by not buying the special bags that a diaper genie requires. I spray the pail after every use and have cleaned it out with bleach and it still smells. Great idea but it just doesn't work. I haven't gone back to the diaper genie yet...is there anything else out there that works?",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I was definately excited to have a diaper pail capable of keeping smells down and holding more diapers. I have two little ones under the age of two.  I was immediately disapointed to find that everytime I tried to filp the diaper into the pail, in the entire thing opened up.  I guess mine could be broken but I think its just poor design.  It also seems to be no better than the competitors at keeping diaper smells in the pail.  The plus is that it uses regular trash bags.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I own both the Diaper Champ and the &quot;other one&quot;.  I have had the &quot;other one&quot; for two years now and cannot wait to get my toddler out of diapers so I can get rid if it.  I bought the Diaper Champ for my newborn and have had for 2 months and LOVE IT!  Easy to use, easy to clean, and I use tall kitchen garbage bags so emptying it is a breeze!  I wipe it out with Lysol Wipes everytime I change the bag and spray the openings with Lysol once a day and have zero odor problems.  Hint: I also put a dryer sheet at the bottom of the pail in the bag so it gets tossed every time I change the bag and a fresh one gets put in!  Enjoy this product - Wish I had known about it with my first child!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is absolutely, by far, the best diaper pail money can buy.  Never do we detect a diaper odor (and my husband has a very sensitive sense of smell and is usually very quick to complain about such things).  For those who say they have a problem with the Diaper Champ getting stuck...the ONLY time this ever happens to us is when the bag is full and needs to be changed.  We love that it uses regular kitchen trash bags, makes it much more economical.  We have not found that we need to worry about frequent emptying or cleaning.  We just leave the Champ to do its job until the mechanism begins to feel like it's getting stuck...then we change the bag.  For us this means about once a week.  Not only is the Champ EASY to use, it's kind of fun.  Before our daughter was born we really worried about whether the diaper pail we chose would be effective enough for us because my husband is so sensitive to smells.  But she's two months old now and we still just can't say enough good things about it.UPDATE:  My daughter is now 9 months old and we STILL love our Diaper Champ.  She's eating solid foods, diapers are smellier, but the Champ is still doing it's job.  We empty once a week and spray with Lysol.  Yes, there is an odor when changing the bag, but we take the bag directly out to the trash, spray Champ with Lysol, insert new bag and close the thing back up.  Everything is just fine after that.  We are so glad we have the Diaper Champ and cannot sing its praises enough.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"At only 3 weeks old, my son goes through about a dozen diapers a day.  We have the diaper champ in his bedroom and it's been great so far.  (We'll see once he switches to solid food and his diapers are a bit more stinky!)  It's so easy to use and you don't have to buy the special bags.  We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.  One recommendation - get a can of Lysol and spray the diaper champ down when you change the bag.  Overall, I love this diaper pail and would buy it again in a hearbeat!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We've been using the Diaper Champ for about 4 months now, and have had NO problems whatsoever!  The design is absolutely ingenious and the fact that it takes regular trash bags is a definite plus!  We bought a box of Hefty Trash Bags with that odor patch to use in the Champ and we change the bag about 2-3 times a week, and we've have had no problems with smell.  I usually wipe the Champ off with a Clorox Wipe each time I change the bag, but my husband decided to take apart the Champ a few weeks ago to give it a thorough cleaning with some bleach water, and he mentioned that the gaskets were looking worn out.  So, I called Baby Trend (Diaper Champ manufacturer) and they sent me to two new gaskets and two new piston rings (which I didn't even ask for) for FREE!  The customer service rep. even told me to call and request more gaskets and rings when we notice that the new ones start to wear out, usually after about 6 months.  Overall, I am very pleased with our purchase.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did...dirty diapes and soaked diapers.....I only noticed an odor one time and that was because I did not close thelid when I changed out the bag. No need for deodorizers.I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty...even did while daughter sleep and no noise! I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell! This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Thank goodness we found something better and easier than ""genie""!!This one works great, no difficulty loading bags or putting diapers in.Only reason for not 5 stars is a little odor escapes but in my opinion well worth the offsetting ease of use.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My baby is 1 month old now and we have been using the diaper champ since day 1.  It is ultra convient when you have your hands full with a dirty diaper and a kicking, squirming wiggle worm.  There has been no smell at all, and the champ's generous size allows plenty of diapers, which is important because it seems as though there is no time to do ANYTHING!!!  I would recomend this product to any and all people with babies.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I changed my registry from the Diaper Genie to the Diaper Champ after reading the reviews for the Diaper Champ online. I'm very happy with it. Our baby's cradle is in our room so we keep the Champ in there with us. There are no odor problems whatsoever. I also love that you don't have to buy specialty bags for this pail.The only caution I give is to moms with long natural or fake nails...the opening latch doesn't release very smoothly. When releasing the latch (which is, wonderfully, a one-handed job, although it can be a tad bit difficult to squeeze), it springs open rather sharply. I have short nails but I can imagine long nails might get broken or fake ones snapped off if care isn't taken when opening the top.Also, the diaper disposal mechanism, which is great (!!!) since it really keeps the odor inside the pail, can be a little loud as it slides down into the pail, especially in the quiet hours in the middle of the night when you're trying to get baby back to sleep. Just be sure to dispose of your diaper(s) before putting baby down to sleep.I would recommend this product to everyone, even with these two very minor issues.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I started off with the Genie but quickly realized that I had to keep buying the special, pricey Genie bags. The Champ is great, takes any appropriate sized plastic bag and contains stinky diaper smells well. A MUST have!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"you can use any ol' bag with this. go to the dollar store and get some of those kitchen bags. they fit it perfectly. you put the diaper in the hold in the top, turn the handle, and pop. byebye poopy diaper! it can hold quite a few. we only need to change the bag once a week. it really does hide the smell. the diaper champ is the best!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"It works ok.  I've had it for a few months - I bought it based on its positive reviews in baby bargains, but I'm going to find something else.  The biggest drawback is that a couple days after emptying it, stuff starts getting stuck in the device so that you have to open it up and wrench poopy wet wipes unstuck...defeats the purpose of an airtight bin.I haven't compared it with other bins, so I couldn't say whether it's the lesser of evils, but hopefully there's something better out there for the job.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We have been using our Diaper Champ for 4 weeks now (trust me, newborns poopy diapers DO smell) and it has met all our expectations. No odor and easy to use!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"So far so good.  I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.  I am wondering how some of these reviewers are able to stand having kids?  Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.  I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I chose the Diaper Champ because you are able to use standard trash bags.  I hate to buy replacement items such as bags ( i usually forget).  I works great.  The only thing is when it is full it is full.  It is very difficult to squeeze anything else into it.  I have not noticed any lingering oder in the baby's room and would recommend this item.,4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Overrated, odor is bad. I changed to Gallon zip-locs, you can stuff a few diapers in a gallon zip loc and discard.  If you don't want the diaper smell don't get this.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I've never even had a problem with it.  There is no odor and I find it very convenient to use garbage bags.  The only thing I do is spray the inside with lysol once in a while.  Even when I change the bag, the only smell is the diapers.  Once they are out, the diaper champ really doesn't have a smell.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We have purchased three diaper pails prior to this one. This one is a hundred times better. The other ones always had springs that broke or the lid wouldn't stay shut. The Diaper Champ has none of these problems, and it is nice to use regular garbage bags. It was a little more expensive, but well worth the extra money.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ was a great invention. No special bags and easy to use one handed. You just put in regular garbage bags (fits like a glove) and empty as you would your regular garbage. NO smells, NO Mess, NO problem. It's a must have!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is the only diaper pail we've had and our son is now 2.  We use scented kitchen trash bags ($3-4 for a huge roll at Target) and that seems to improve it's olfactory-blunting performance even more.  For especially messy and stinky diapers, I'll pre-bag the whole bundle in a small scented bag ($1 for 100 at Dollar Tree) that I can rest in the opening of the Champ.This may seem like a lot of bother, but it's not!  I haven't even washed the Diaper Champ out or Lysol'd it in 2 years.  Did I really just admit that?!?  We empty it no more than 2x per week, on average 1x per week.  If there's ever a smell in the nursery, it's from the dipaer's presence pre-Diaper Champ entry.I do wish the Diaper Champ people could find a way to have some button the parent can push to flip the handle while keeping the 1 hand operation.  My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).  Some simple child-proof mechanism would be a Godsend.Even with that said,  the Diaper Champ is a great product and I'd recommend it to anyone!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,Works great - no smells.  LOVE that it uses regular garbage bags. Easy to change and keep clean. Great option instead of the Diaper Genie that requires special bags and is so wasteful since it wraps each diaper in plastic.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We got the Diaper Champ as a gift and immediately fell in love with it.  I wish I had invented this product.  It is one of our Top 10 items to buy.It takes regular kitchen trash bags and is really quite good about the smell.  Now that we are introducing Isabella to more foods we are finding that it does not contain the smell as well, but better than anything else that we use.The only problem I run into this that it gets stuck on the inside from time to time at the worst possible moment -- stinky full diaper that needs to disappear right now!  I am pregnant again so these smells get to me.  Because of this problem I gave it 4 stars.It gets stuck from an occasional diaper sticky tab sticking to the inside .  When this happens, you have open everything up and it can get a little messy if the tab was stuck in the wrong placeWe also own a Diaper Genie which is 99% smell proof, but also has it's own problems.  I would only buy this one, even if money, space and smell were not an issue.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Like other reviewers, I put this diaper pail on my registry because I just didn't want the hassle of having to buy special bags--what happens when you run out in the middle of the night!  I liked the fact that you can use regular bags in this diaper pail... in fact I frequently recycle BabiesRUs bags by using them in the Diaper CHamp.  I have twins--so you can imagine how much poop goes into this pail and I've never had a problem with smell (I've been using it for two+ months now).  You just put the diaper in the hole... flip the lid and the counterweight pushes the diaper down into the bag underneath and its ready for the next diaper--then you flip it back.  The flip handle does get stuck sometimes... but only when it's TIME TO EMPTY THE PAIL!!!!  Some reviewers seem to think the pail should empty itself, but unfortunately nothing on the market will do that for you.  When you change the bag (which is incredibly easy to do) you can just spray the inside with a little lysol and then periodically wipe it out with a sponge and some bleach.  I'd do that much even with the more expensive diaper pails and I'd still have to buy expensive special bags.... You can't expect something that contains poop to smell like a rose or to be germ free without a little work on your part, but with the Diaper Champ you can have a smell-free nursery AND save money by using plain ordinary garbage bags (or recycled plastic bags!)",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have a two month old.  I've tried both the Diaper Champ and the Diaper Genie for two months now.Bottom line:If cost is important to you...get the Diaper ChampIf smell is important to you...get the Diaper GenieThe design of the Diaper Champ does not prevent smell as well as the Diaper Genie PERIOD.If you see a review here that touts that the Diaper Champ doesn't smell, then laugh at them.  They probably have a dog and think that it and their house don't smell because of the dog either.YES, the Diaper Genie costs more over the life because of their bags.  SO WHAT.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"When our daughter was born we bought the diaper genie and it soon became another unused thing in our closet.  I found it so impractical, because no matter what it says it is never truely one hand operable.  And it takes so long to stuff and twist that the baby is neglected on the changing table for a longer period of time.  Also, it didn't hold very many diapers and was a pain to unload.  I would rather just walk each diaper outside!  So when we were pregnant with our son I told my husband that we had to go shopping for a new diaper pail and that's when we found the diaper champ.  I now give this at every baby shower I go to even if the mom-to-be has registered for the diaper genie!  I know she will convert to this one.  I have never had a problem with odor, and it is truely one hand operable, as well as taking less than a second to operate.  All you do is flip the handle over and you're done.  No need to push the diaper in with your hand (gross!) just let gravity do it's thing.  It is also very easy to unload and install a new bag.  Plus there are no special bags!  Not only a money saver, but no need to worry about running out.  I just use our kitchen trash bags, and they work great.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"After the first 6 months I would have been rating this diaper pail top of the heap.  Certainly not having to buy special bags is a HUGE advantage... and the hole is larger that the genie so you don't have to worry about the &quot;squish&quot; factor as much.The problem, and the reason others had a smell problem is that this pail has large foam washers and a foam pad in the top section that get rank after time.  Luckily we just called the company and they sent new ones and the smell went when they did, but it was a bit of a pain.  I still think it was worth it to buy this one!",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have used my Diaper Champ for a little over a year.  I was taken in by the fact that I could use grocery bags instead of continually purchasing liner refills.  The Champ worked great for only a small while.  As your children grow, the Champ will be very little help in controlling odor, which is the sole reason I purchased a diaper pail instead of a garbage can.  I change the pail every two days, sometimes every day due to the odors it fails to control.  I have begun to individually wrap up each smelly diaper before putting it into the diaper pail.  Otherwise, my son's room would constantly smell.  I am reluctant to purchase a new diaper pail, but the hassle with this one is pushing me to it.  Consider the Diaper Dekor or Neat Disposal System instead.  I've read great reviews on both.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Simply put, the Diaper Champ is much easier to use, less expensive, and most importantly, MUCH better at keeping those odors locked away when compared to the Diaper Genie.  Even the smell of my niece's ""soy diapers"" don't seep through this.  I have been thoroughly impressed -- even the nurses at the hospital where I had my baby recommended it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love my Diaper Champ. My son is 3 months old and we have had a great experience with it. It's simple to use and is cost efficient. The biggest plus to this diaper pail is that you can use any plastic bag you want. As far as some people saying it smells, I haven't had a problem. Once a week I soak it with Lysol and water to keep germs away. I highly recommed this product if you want a clean, simple, and convenient diaper pail!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I agree it's better than the genie.  I own the genie and served us well.  But when I had the chance to use this product at Babies R Us store, I was so impressed.  It's very easy to use, and it seals out the odor as well.  I wanted to get this for our use, but my genie is still in good use.  Too bad, the champ came late, or we should have gotten this instead.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love the diaper champ.  I registered for this item because I liked the fact that it takes regular garbage bags.  When it's almost full it tends to have a bit of an odor, but lysol takes care of that, and helps kill germs.  This is very easy to use and is simple to change.  I highly recommend the diaper champ.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This contains the smell and it uses regular bags which makes it the best product in its category.  However, I never use it.  It's so much easier just to throw the soiled diaper in a regular garbage bag and take the trash out often.  We take ours out daily - this product tends to make you lazy and by the time you fill it - YUCK!Save your money and just throw your diapers in the trash.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We bought this because we needed a first floor diaper pail.  And the Diaper Genie was a bit hard to use, so we tried this one.  While this is very easy to use (one-handed), after 36-48 hours, it smells really bad!!  So we have to change the bag in it very frequently.  Oh well, I'd still recommend it.  You just may have to buy stock in air fresheners as well.  And we even bag our smelly diapers before putting them in.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,love it because it uses the bags from the grocery store.  way cheaper than others.  have to change regulary (2 times per week) when the baby gets on solids though.,4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I registered for the Diaper Champ after reading many reviews for several different diaper pails.  This is by far the easiest product to use.  There are no complicated bag systems and no special replacement bags.  I have not had the problem of having any oppressive odors leak out into the room.  The only odor was inside the actual diaper pail itself.  There is no such thing as a completely odorless plastic diaper pail since plastic absorbs odors, but just drop a couple of dryer sheets (Bounce or something similar) into the bottom of the diaper champ (not in the bag) and the odor disappears.  This product is easy to use and the bags aren't hard to change.  I would recommend this to anyone.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,My 8 year old yellow lab was able to get the top of the diaper champ off and get his head stuck in the canistar.  No one was home and he suffocated.  This could just as easily have happend to a small child.  There is no warning in the literature to prevent this type of horrible tragedy .,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I have no problems with my Diaper Champ.  It's great to be able to use regular diaper bags and I never have any problems with smell.  Definitely recommend,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We are first time parents but have friends who have young children. We always try to get out of spending the night at their house because the diaper pail in the spare bathroom smells so bad. We took a strangers advice (no one we knew believed in a diaper pail that didn't stink) and we purchased this product. We couldn't be happier. At first we used it for disposable diapers which worked fine, but we were worried about how it was going to hold up when we started using cloth diapers. Our baby is now 3 weeks old and we have been using cloth diapers for 2 weeks and the diaper champ is doing great....no smell, no hassle with bags, no hassle getting the bag out and to the laundry room.Someone else wrote that the product has a design flaw in that the diapers can get stuck in the top. We did run in to that once, it means the diaper champ is full and you need to empty it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I wasn't going to get a diaper disposal system because I knew I did not want a new baby and then worrying about making sure I had the proper garbage bags.  But, I found the Diaper Champ and love it!  It works well and I went to Costco and purchased enough bags to last until the babies in high school for under twenty bucks!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is by far the best diaper disposal system we have found. You don't need any special bags - we usually just buy a roll of 35 13-gallon bags from Target for 99 cents. Usually the odor is not really a problem if you change the bags frequently, but if you don't have a chance to change the bags just put a poopy diaper in a  plastic grocery bag before throwing it in the diaper champ. Your odor problem will be solved.I would recommend this to everyone.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it.  It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife).  It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.  As the bag fills, you may need to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the diaper into the bag.  For the first 9 months or so, we only needed to empty this once a week.  Now that our son's diapers are a little larger, they take up more space, and we empty twice a week.  We have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck (we always wrap them in the dirty diaper).  It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!Update (March 2005): My son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now, but the Diaper Champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use, no problems with odors, and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby :-)",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is a wonderful product.  One suggestion to the manufacturer--the blue piece that holds the bag in place--perhaps the mouth of this could be made bigger so that an 8 gallon trash bag actually fills up completely before you need to take it out.  Right now, it's only about 1/2 to 2/3 full before we have to remove it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I did a lot of research before buying a ""diaper system"" (asked friends, read other reviews on amazon, consulted baby product guides, etc.).  There didn't seem to be a consensus on the best one out there.  However, I have been very happy with my Diaper Champ purchase - the stink is contained, the dirty diapers drop in easily and it uses regular kitchen bags (no special bags required like other systems).",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The best feature is that you can use your own garbage bags.  This makes the investment in a diaper pail a one-time occurance!!  The Diaper Champ works by using a piston-type chute.  You put the diaper in the chute, flip the handle, and the piston slide the diaper down into the bag below.  Nothing fancy...nothing to break!So far, it has worked great.  We change the bags 1-2 times per week.  Yes, it is stinky when you remove the bag, but what do you expect?!  We did put an sticky deodorant in the pail to help.  I agree with previous reviews...you still have to clean the thing!!When comparing to my sister's Diaper Genie, this is much simpler to use and costs much less over its lifetime.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This has been a fantastic diaper pail for us.  We went through a Diaper Genie with each of our first two children, and this third time, I'm so glad we tried the Diaper Champ.  It has proven to be far better than the Diaper Genies.  Our baby is 7 months old now and eating solids, and the odors have not been a problem.  Not buying special bags has been great.  No twisting; no cutting; no blades to wear out.  Wish we'd used this with our first two.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"As much as I hear you all on the Diaper Champ - it is fabulous - the SMELL factor is greatly reduced when you take the trouble to empty diapers into the lavatory first.  This is what you are SUPPOSED to be doing.  Feces should NOT go into landfills because they can carry bacteria and intestinal viruses which can filter into, and contaminate, groundwater and soils.  Very few people seem to realize this and it is disconcerting that so many people are posting about the wonderful smell reducing power of this contraption without realizing that they are using it INCORRECTLY!  Please be more conscientious!  Do your part and put the poop in the pot and help to preserve our precious planet for that little person whose bottom you are currently managing.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Baby Luke can turn a clean diaper to a dirty diaper in 3 seconds flat. The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into ""what diaper smell"" in less time than that. I hesitated and wondered what I REALLY needed for the nursery. This is one of the best purchases we made. The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!! There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genieplus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I find this product easy to operate.  With any diaper pail you will have odor, but folding the diapers up and using the sticky tabs on the diapers to keep the diaper folded will help keep odor away.  We bought 2, one for near the crib and one for the main floor.  BRILLIANT idea...didn't have to run up the stairs just to throw the diaper out.  Another helpful idea...put used diaper wipes in the diaper before folding the diaper up...otherwise the wipe will sometimes get caught in the slider and leave poopies on the pail.  How often did we have to empty it?  -  twice/wk when he was 0-3 months...once a wk after that.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I decided to register for this diaper pail mainly because of the fact that it didn't require special bags.  My baby is now almost 6 weeks old and we are really happy with it.  You can use regular kitchen garbage bags and our nursery doesn't smell at all.  It's very easy to use.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I believed the reviews of this product, and bought it when my baby was an infant.  It worked very well while I was still breastfeeding, but once we started solid food, the smell was pretty bad.  Each morning when we went into his room, the whole place smelled like diapers.  Still, I resisted the diaper genie, because I didn't want to spend the money on the refills.  However, by 10 months, we had enough, and finally bought a diaper genie.  What a difference!!  The only time smell escapes is when we empty it.  To me, it is worth the price of refills not to have to put up with the smell.  If it is not worth it to you, just buy a regular garbage can--it will work just as well as the &quot;champ&quot;.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,If you dont want the baby room to smell bad and do not want to worry buying special bags all time. This is the product for you.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,Easy to change bags.Stable when changing bags (others are not!!!) - won't topple over.REGULAR GARBAGE BAGSOne hand use.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I love this diaper pale and wouldn't dream of trying anything else.  It is great that you can use regular trashbags and not have to buy expensive cartridges.  So far it has done great on containing the odor and I like how easy it is to use.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,Worth every single penny and then some! I orginally registered for the famous ""Diaper Genie"" but was so thankful that my mother-in-law purchased this one instead after doing some research of her own. No special bags needed so I can use my every day kitchen trash bags when I need to empty and virtually no smell from stinky diapers- you can't beat that! I am even thinking of purchasing one for my upstairs as well. Definitely the best one on the market.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I got this for my daughter and I just think it's great. We have this in her room and I haven't smelled any ordors coming from it except for when you open it up to take out the bag. I also love the fact that you can use just regular bags. I know of someone that had a diaper genie and she still had a diaper in it from when her baby was born and she was about 2 months at that time. I've found that when it starts getting alittle full just shake it to level the diapers out and you will be able to get more in there. I have also heard that some people put kitty litter at the bottom of the bag to help eliminate some of the odors, but I haven't had to try this yet. I would highly recommend this to anyone.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have to say I really like the Diaper Champ, with one exception-it is definitely NOT always odor free.  I have had to put it in the bathroom now instead of the baby room, because smells from &quot;stinky&quot; diapers will seep out.  I think the best advice is to wrap the really smelly ones in a plastic bag before putting them in. Another word of advice-keep a can of Lysol next to it to spray when you throw a diaper away. It can also be hard to open-I've broken several nails on it.  I've only had it a few weeks (I've been using it for my toddler's diapers until my new baby comes), and I'm hoping that the latch on it loosens up a bit with opening and shutting. Otherwise, it's great that it holds more diapers, and it's SO much easier to put the diapers in it than the Diaper Genie I had.  I don't need two hands for it!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We are cloth diaper users and were attracked to the diaper champ because it said it could be used for cloth diapers and it keeps the smell in unlike other diaper pails. We were so disapointed to find out that it does not hold a full laundry load of diapers and cloth wipes. Some of our diaper covers also got stuck in the mechanism and I had to take it apart with a screwdriver to avoid ripping the cover. Mine is now in a closet and I'm using a regular garbage pail. If you are planning to use cloth, this is not the pail for you.If your are using disposables, I think this pail would be great since you can wad them up into a tight ball. It doesn't stink except when you open it to change the liner and it takes regular bags.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"After reading the reviews and comparing with the diaper genie, I went with the diaper champ; mainly because it didn't require expensive refills. I love that i can use my own trash bags! I change the bags about 2 times/week and have not noticed any smells. I spray with lysol when changing the bags (hello, diapers are stinky and this still will require cleaning). Overall, highly recommend it!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love the Diaper Champ. I fought with the Diaper Geanie throughout my first son. This is so much easier to use, the three year old has mastered it! Uses your own bags. Don't waste time with others.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I received the Champ at my baby shower, and continue to thank my sister for it. My son can really drop a load, and you would almost never know it once it is in the pail. We do basic maintenance, like cleaning it every so often and spraying Lysol to keep it fresh. We save SOOO much money buying 150 ct 13 gal garbage bags for about $5. My one suggestion would be to change the bags out more ofen then needed, though. It helps to keep the tunnel from getting stuck, and decreases the chance of unwanted oders leaking out. I highly recommend owning one. Good Luck!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,This is an excellent idea having the lid to dispose of diapers.There is no odor and extremely easy to use. Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,It is so easy to use. You never have to change any cartridges and you can use an ordinary garbage bag. I love it and we have never had any smell escape from it.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love this diaper pail. Yea, if you let poopy diapers sit in it for too long and don't change the bag on a regular basis it will start to stink but  c'mon its a bucket full of poopy diapers.As you child grows, or if you have older children watch out. The handle system fascinates  little ones and they find it amusing that they can put something in, flip it and it disappears,  which is good when it's a diaper, bad when it's,,, your keys.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This diaper pail is great. It is the third one that I have tried. I just wish that I had it 4 years ago with my first child. It is very easy to use. You don't need special liners or refills. A regular garbage bag works fine. I had the Diaper Genie and it didn't keep odors out. The Diaper Champ doesn't totally keep odors away, but it works just as well if not better than the others I have tried. The diaper champ is very easy to use. You only need one hand to ""operate"" it. My 2 year old loves ""helping"" out and can independently use it.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is a great diaper disposal system, but from reading many of the negative reviews I think there are many individuals who did not bother to read the instructions. the bag goes through the hole in the blue retaining ring,  then gets folded over the retaing ring and locked in place, at no point should any of the bag be out side the pale and if the bag is put in place like a regular trash can it will not seal properly and you will probaly get a smell. I can not comment on the few reviews who had a seal falure for I have not had mine long enough.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I read many reviews about diaper disposals and decided on the Diaper Champ and am VERY glad I did!  I had only heard about diaper genie but had never used it until I was visiting my brother who had one.  Now that I have used both, I am even more certain that I like the diaper champ!  With the diaper genie, you have to push the dirty diaper low enough so you can then twist the lid (the whole diaper sausage thing).  I didn't know that until I used it.  YUCK!  Plus what a pain when you have a baby in your hand.  The diaper champ is much easier...put the diaper in the lid and then flip the lid from one side to the other.  Being able to use regular trash bags is what hooked me in but now that I have used it, I'm sold!  There's no smell except for the brief moments when you change the bag.  Just keep a stick-up in the diaper champ, and you'll be fine!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Let's face it.  This is a specially designed garbage can to hold human feces.  One cannot expect that it will be odor free.  Mine certainly isn't.  It is my fault, though.  If I emptied the bag more often, there would not be a stench.  But alas, I am lazy.  So when I do change the bag, I also spray some lysol.  Works for me.  I like it that you just have to flip the handle for the diaper to go bye bye.When I first got the product, I really hurt my finger trying to open the thing.  But that was my own fault.  I did not have it on the floor.  When opening the lid, step on the stabilizer ring at the bottom of the unit and it opens with ease.I too love that you do not have to buy special bags for this.  What a pain to have to remember to buy and then spend five bucks a pop on Genie bags.  Thanks, but no.All in all, I really like my Diaper Champ.  It's also taller than the genie which is good for me, I don't have to bend over so much to flip the lid.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"i love this diaper champ..not only does it save money on bags cause you use whatever brand you want it is bigger so it holds more and i havent had a smell come out of it!  My husband liked it so much he wants to buy another one for the den just for regular trash!!!  Another nice thing about it is you can put other items in it besides just diapers, and unlike the diaper genie you dont have to push down and smoush the diaper to get it in.  Wonderful item!!  (as you can tell i have use the diaper genie with my first child)  totally recommend the diaper champ!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This item is great, you can you any bags you want (unlike the diaper Genie)!!!!! It is great for the price!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ is difficult to use and does not contain the smell at all!!  After you turn the handle to bring the diaper down, if there are more than a few diapers in there, it gets stuck and you have to turn it a few times to get it down.  It smells pretty bad after a day or two, and this is after cleaning it with Pine Sol AND letting it air out!!The only advantage is that you can use your own bags, but what good is that if you are constantly cleaning it and spraying Lysol??",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"If you can love a diaper pail that is...  The Diaper Champ is EASY to use (one hand) and very sturdy.  No parts to break unlike the other leading brand.  It does a great job blocking odors and best of all, is compatible with ANY plastic bag.  Here's a tip:  Tie dirty diapers in grocery sacks before depositing into the Diaper Champ.  NO SMELL WHATSOEVER that way!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"For my first born I purchased the Diaper Genie. It worked out well for the first 6 months. As the diaper sizes got larger the harder it was to get the diaper to fit. It would squish out the sides, making a horrible mess! So I purchased the wide mouth size. More $$! The larger diapers fit a little better, but the monthly cost of special Diaper Genie bags started adding up.With the birth of our second child, I refused to use the Diaper Genie. SO in a search for something better than a smelly garbage can in our baby's room, we found the Diaper Champ.The Diaper Champ out performed the Diaper Genie, not once was the diaper too large to fit in the top of the unit and it was cost effective because it uses your standard trash bags!On trash day, we would open the top pull out the old bag, tie it up, throw in a new one, and out to the corner for trash pickup.Ten years and 3 more kids later, this diaper pail is still the Champ in our house!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I received my Diaper Champ at my baby shower for the birth of my first son 11 months ago. I use it faithfully every day and love the ease and convenience of only having to change the bag once a week! I love that you can use regular kitchen-size trash bags and don't need to purchase any special expensive bags. One thing you might want to be careful of, however...make sure you do not throw loose baby wipes into the Diaper Champ or else the flip mechanism can become jammed and after time will not seal properly due to having to pull out wipes that are stuck. I love my diaper champ so much, I have asked for a second one for my upcoming baby shower for my second son.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I am a second time mom who used the rival Diaper Genie the first time around and let me tell you that there is no comparison. The Diaper Champ is easy to use, easy to change and uses everyday garbage bags instead of the expensive refills. Besides myself, my husband and mother found the Diaper Genie very frustrating to use, changing the bags required quite a bit of time and energy, all the while smelling the stinky diaper smell. The Diaper Champ is not perfect, it sometimes feels as if it has filled up too quickly (i.e. maybe it's not big enough), and when you change bags you do get a whiff of bad smell, but the smelly time is very short in comparison. So, I would strongly recommend that you buy the Diaper Champ and not waste your time, money and patience with the other product.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,GOOD POINTS:Easy to operate and change.Less expensive to use than comperable products.Kept smell in for several months as other products did.We were unable to break it after 10 mos unlike competitors.BAD POINTS:Toddler kept flipping it back and forth and touching where we put the diapers.Did not keep room odor free after several mos of use.,4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Great size, we only change each week but after 5 months the smell started to seep through and the nursery after 8 months is smelling too much of diapers now, despite airfreshners etc.  If my baby used this as a bedroom, he sleeps with us I would have replaced this sooner !!  I even washed it all our in bleach but the seals must have gone as its just getting worse.  I like the size though and love the fact you just put the diaper in dirty and swing the top over.  One problem with this is when it gets full the diapers get stuck - thats not very pleasent too.Going to BabyRUs this morning as after 8 months I decided today is the day its ready totally for a new one.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I am really disappointed with the Diaper Champ.  It worked great at first, but then the foam seal broke and it wouldn't contain the smell.  Babies 'R Us gratiously exchanged it for another one and it happened again.  I would say it's a product default.  We always made sure the tape was tucked in, etc., but the foam liner just kept coming out.  Plus, sometimes when the diaper was really heavy and big, like in the morning when they're soaked, it wouldn't fit in the chamber and turn properly, so we'd have to jam it in there, gross!Otherwise, the champ worked well on odors and accepting diapers.  I'm pregnant with baby #2 and will look into other diaper pails.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"As a first time mother, I wanted to get the best for my daughter. I shopped around a lot, and asked a lot of questions. While at someone's house, I saw the Diaper Champ. It was one that I hadn't seen very much in the various stores I shopped in. I was immediately impressed by the ease of it, and the convenience of being able to use ANY bag!!!When I bought it, I didn't have a chance to show my husband how to use it -- but no worries!!! It is so simple to figure out how to use! My nephew -- a toddler, knows how to use it (without him being able to open it up!)I've even recommended it to strangers in the baby stores!You'll love it!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I like the slim shape and that you can use regular tall kitchen bags with the Diaper Champ. BUT, it really isn't that great in controlling odor. Sometimes diapers get stuck in the ""flipping tube"" and then you have to open it and pull it out... what a mess! It isn't all that easy to clean either.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We've now had the Diaper Champ for a little over a year! We love it. It's better for the environment than other disposable diaper systems and it really doesn't smell! I highly recommend it. Drawbacks: it doesn't hold that many diapers at a time. We have 2 in dapers and we changes it 3 times a week or so. It needs to be cleaned pretty often or lots of mold and bacteria start to grow (on the parts you can't see until you take it apart). Lastly part of the fabric/plastic material has ripped on part of it so it is a bit harder to flip back in forth when you  put new dirty diapers in! Overall, this is a great product!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"After Our Diaper Genie broke after 2 years, I was advised to buy the D. Champ. It was highly recommended by a new mom with an infant. Big mistake, her baby as well as most of the people reviewing this positively are using it with their INFANTS, so their diapers do not smell like that of a one or two year old toddler!!!!!!!!  The Genie does a much better job of masking the odors, Yes, it is more cumbersome in terms of changing out the plastic....but that I can live with.  The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We put a Diaper Genie on the shower list for the first baby. We used it for 2 years and it was OK but we were fed up with it and I took a chance on the Diaper Champ for #2. After 5 months, we couldn't be happier with Diaper Champ. Here's a short list of the main reasons I'd recommend this against diaper genie:5. Diaper Champ doesn't use expensive refills like the genie. We were going through 2-3 of those $5 refills a month with the genie. On the conservative side, say that was $120 a year in genie refills. With the Diaper Champ, I bought one big box of Glad Kitchen drawstring bags (150 bags) for $15 at the warehouse club. We change the bag 1-2x weekly. The 150 bags will probably last 1 1/2 -2 years, for $15. (The Champ box says you can use plastic grocery bags. Don't. They're way too small and don't hold enough diapers to make it worth the while.)4. The Champ holds a lot more than the genie. Less frequent emptying.3. The genie was a pain to empty and even more work to change refills. Emptying involves tying off the tiny little sausage tube bag, restarting the cut end of the refill. Pain. Changing the refill was just annoying. When the refill runs out, there's not enough bag to tie so you are stuck holding an open end of a dirty diaper bag. I don't need that. And at any change or refill, you have to find another bag to drop the sausage string of dirty diapers into. With the champ, I open the lid, tie off the drawstring bag and that bag goes straight into the garbage can. The new bag goes in as simple as a trash-can liner and close the lid.2. The genie broke after about 15 months. There are 4 little plastic prongs inside that hold the diaper in place while you twist the ring to seal the diaper in the bag. The spring on one broke and it never held the diapers well again after that.1. And my top reason why the diaper champ is champ: It's perfectly easy to use, impossible to use wrong. Whenever we had a babysitter or family member helping while we used the genie, we always took a couple of minutes to show them how to use it. We'd come home and every time, they'd gotten in wrong and used the cutter tool on top and cut the diaper bag like they were changing it when they just needed to put the diaper in. No, it's not difficult to use or get right once you do it a few times but if you only use it once a month, that dial on top that turns the cutter is just to obvious to turn to ignore and impossible not to turn. Every single time someone got it wrong. So, the Diaper Champ. you drop the diaper in the open hole and flip the handle and it's gone. I can't think of a way anyone could do it wrong and most people who've used it so far, don't need even the simplest hint from us on how to use it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I love this diaper pail. It keeps the diapers from stinking up your room/house. I also love that I can use regualer old kitchen bags and dont' have to fork over extra bucks for special bags. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that I wish that it held more diapers.,4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I chose this product because unlike the Diaper Genie you don't have to buy replacement bags, just pop in a tall kitchen garbage bag which we all have in our homes anyway.  I have twin boys and this product works great.  I recommend spraying it with Lysol and letting it air dry in between bag changes.  This works for me.  It also holds a lot of diapers.  I highly recommend it!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I'm SO glad that we asked the sales associate at Babies R Us for help when picking out a diaper pail.  We were going to get a Diaper Genie like so many folks do, but the associate showed us the Diaper Champ and how easy it was to use. All I have to do is turn the handle and the diaper goes down.  There's no twisting and no special liners to buy.  As far as smell goes, ALL diaper pails will smell if they're not changed often enough.  We don't have a problem with ours smelling as long as we change it every three to four days (which should be done no matter what product you buy).  When I got pregnant with my second child (they are only 18months apart) we bought a second Diaper Champ.  We also just purchased one for my brother-in-law and his wife for their new baby.  Before buying ANY other diaper pail, compare it to this one first.  You'll be amazed at how easy it is to use.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Love it, love it, love it!  This lives up to the hype.  You cannot smell diapers-unless of course you don't change it or clean out.  You can also use any trash bags you already have around the house, which is why we purchased this particular diaper pail.  It can be hard to open if you have long nails, but I have found that if you just use the side of your finger instead of your fingertips then it's no problem.  I have recommended this to all new parents!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have been very happy with this pail.  The greatest thing... regular trash bags!!  The Next greatest thing... 1 handed operation & it takes only a SECOND! Awesome!I have not had any issues with odor.  I change the bag every 5-6 days or so.  If the plunger is not going down, it's because you need to change the bag!!The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because changing the bag takes a few minutes.  It can be difficult to open, ALthough, when my daughter gets older and starts getting into things, this will probably be a blessing! :)",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"After using this for 3 years, I still stunned that other people still use the Diaper Genie.  I've even had other Moms tell me that they can't smell dirty diapers in my house, even with 2 kids producing them.  If anyone is having trouble, though, try:  a)  wrapping the tabs securely around the diaper; b)  using deodorant trash bags;  and c)  taking dirty diapers straight outside to the trash and using your diaper pail just for wet diapers.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I loved this compared to the genie. It is easier to use and less costly in the long run!!Two thumbs up!!!Now, only if it would spray a freshner on its own. LOL!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We got the Diaper Champ because we thought it was smart to use regular garbage bags and not pay for the diaper Genie refills. BIG MISTAKE! This product does not keep odor in, and when you open it up to put in a new bag in, its all over. My daughter's room stinks because of this product and we are in the process of trying to find a REAL odorless diaper pail.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I returned the Diaper G**** that I was given but kept this!  It takes ANY garbage bag (no expensive refills) and is wonderful for controlling odor... that's especially important now that our little guy is eating solid food and making more stinky diapers!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband saw this after my first shower and said ""What's that thing for?""  He now loves it.  I do too.  Best of all, you don't have to buy specific bags, we use the bags from the grocery and they do quite well.  We've bought some air freshener cans and put them in the bottom, because after 8 months of use, it's going to smell.  But the room does not carry the smell, only when you're on the floor near the genie.  My only issue is that I've broken a nail or two lifting the latch to get the top open.  But it's infinitely better than having the smell!!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We received the Diaper Champ as a shower gift.  It worked great for the 1st 5 months.  As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I highly recommend this item.  It is a must!  I registered for the diaper genie and used it for about a week and couldn't stand it.  It broke,the refills are expensive and very hard to install.  Then I got the diaper champ.  What a difference.  Easy to use, just one hand, and no odors.  It uses just your basic tall garbage bags.  So you don't have to go out and buy special bags for it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband and I originally registered for the Diaper Genie, but we changed our minds when we considered that we would only be able to use the Diaper Genie refills.  The Diaper Champ allows you to use regular garbage bags.  Plus it's simple to use.  We haven't had a problem with odor at all.  It's a great product!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have a 10 year old daughter and an 8 month old son. There was nothing like this when I had my first child and I really looked into the champ v's genie before I brought this and I have to say that I truly LOVE it. I change the bag once a week. My kids have to share a room so if it was smelly I would hear about it. I just spray with a little Lysol at the time of bag change and it is as good as new. Aside form that it is so easy to use with one hand, anyone with a wiggly baby will appreciate that. In fact I love it so much I am going to take one all the way to Australia with me for my niece since she can't get them over there. I am the owner of a used baby store in NJ, (I have a champ there too) and this is one of my hottest items, I have several diaper genies there that just do not sell.You will not be sorry you brought the Diaper Champ.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is easy, but horribly smelly.  I suggest saving your money and buying a regular trash can.  You will get the same effect, because this doesn't do anything special.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"...make sure I tell people about this product. I read the reviews, and at the time, this was the only diaper pail that got any decent reveiws, and now I know why. I bought one for upstairs, and liked it so much I bought one for downstairs. I still have on in my registery hoping someone will get me a third one for my mother in law's house. I just use a standard pull string kitchen trash bag, and use it according to the instructions (in other words if you follow the procedure of opening and sinching the bag before removal then you won't have a problem) and it works great, good design!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I've given this can as a gift a few times now.  Once to a couple who were on their second child, their response was 'how'd we survive through the first baby without that can'.It's easy, ordourless, and clean.  What more could new parents on.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I have 2 kids in diapers and the diaper champ has been great for us for 2 1/2 years. Easy to use and change. I love that it uses reg bags. :),5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I registered for this after reading all the reviews and I've been nothing but happy with it. I tried my sister's diaper genie and the diaper champ is so much easier to use. The fact that I use the same bags for my kitchen as I do the champ makes it that much easier. I just leave some in the bottom of the champ then I don't have to go looking for them. I've never noticed a smell, and although I do agree that it is hard to open, you get used to it and it's worth it!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We have ours in our living room and you can't smell a thing.  It is a little difficult to open and it doesn't hold a lot of diapers, but overall it works well.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have had a great experience with this product so far and have been using it for about 2 months.  I get absolutely no odors in the tiny nursery (even when my daughter had very smelly diarrhea), it's easy to use and DOES NOT NEED ANY EXPENSIVE REFILL BAGS (just regular garbage bags) and I would recommend it to anyone.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The boy is now 1 year old and we have had it since the beginning.  I remember reading a good review about the Diaper Champ and deciding to get it.Honestly, it does a great job.  It does contain the odor to inside the Champ.  I have never noticed a smell in the room, even when it is full.  I have to admit, however, that when you open that bad boy up to empty it, it's pretty funky, but what do you expect?If you wrap up your diapers good and empty it before it gets so full that you can't squeeze another diaper into it, you will really be happy.  It is very nice to be able to used regular kitchen sized trash bags.  We use the scented bags, which we think helps a lot.Overall, we are very pleased with the Diaper Champ and would recommend it highly! (Only reason I rated it 4out of 5 stars is - nothing's perfect, I have a hard time giving out 5 to anything!)",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is a great product until your little one starts to play with the handle.  Because the flip-flop handle comes in contact with the dirty diapers when the bag gets full, curious fingers can pick up some nasty germs &amp; even poop if a diaper isn't wrapped up into itself (The Grandmas seem to have trouble with that).I have been very happy with the simplicity of the Champ &amp; using regular garbage bags until now.  However, my 14 month old loves to play with it &amp; flip the handle over. I just cringe when I think about what he gets on his hands.Also, the padding in the lid that keeps odor under control seems to have worn out after 1 year.  It came loose, we had to pull it out &amp; there were dirty wipes stuck in there, too. YUCK!Overall, I would recommend the Champ for infants because it's VERY easy &amp; you can use 1 hand, but now that I have a toddler I'm looking for a pail with a locking lid.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My son is now 5 mo. and overall, I'm happy with the diaper champ.  I would not recommend wasting money on the types that require special bags. Do not kid yourself that you will have an odor-free diaper pail--I do not think that is possible!  I would rate this as low-odor--I change the bag about once a week.  My complaint, though, is that the plunger-cylinder thing gets stuck because the diapers begin to stack on top of one-another even when the bag is newly-changed.  Also, I do not use the plunger for messy diapers because if the tabs are nor fastened, the tabs get stuck in the plunger thing.  I do not wrap up the messy ones because of the leak factor, so I wind up having to open the lid frequently. The lid is a bit difficult to open, but I like that because when my little guy is more mobile he won't be able to open it!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,The diaper champ is fantastic. You can use regular trash bags which helps reduce the cost of expensive specialty bags. There is absolutely no dirty diaper smell that comes from the Diaper Champ.Absolutely recommend this product.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love this pail.  You just drop the diaper in the hole, and flip the handle/lid.  Sooooo simple.  It does not smell, and it holds any garbage bags.  With the Diaper Genie, you have to open the lid, shove your arm in the pail, twist 3 times, then wipe off your arm if you know what I mean.  (It also needs special cartridges).  With the Diaper Champ, there is no mess and the diaper is gone in 1 second!  It holds more diapers too.  I definitely recommend it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I was given the Diaper Geni and after a week of twisting, we bought the Diaper Champ.  This was a great choice.  There is no need to spend extra money on special bags.  We use ordinary supermarket bags.  In order to keep the smell under control, we sprinkle baking soda right at the bottom of the chamber.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I got this pail because I felt it was good that it doesn't require you to buy ""their"" garbage bags.  But at the end I still didn't use it and just use a regular pail.  Now it's sitting in my basement.  The reason I didn't use it is because it is hard to open up the can to replace the bag and when you are actually cleaning a baby especially when it's #2 it is messy at times where you would probably get it in the pail before you flip the handle to dispose of it.  Well then you  now need to clean the pail as well as the baby.  You don't need more work with a child.,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Worst diaper pale ever!!  I've had mine for 2 years now and I am throwing it away as soon as my second Decor arrives.  No matter how many times I clean the ""Chump"" it still stinks.  The diapers and wipes get caught in the drop hole and stuck wet wipes make it stink even worse.  Forget scented trash bags, they won't cure the smell of the ""Chump"".  Also, watch out when changing the bag, you may lose a finger if the lid unexpectedly slams shut on you when changing it.  Forget this pale and go for the Decor.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My sister had a Diaper Genie and it always smelled really bad. She constantly complained about it so I opted to try the Diaper Champ. Boy am I glad! It is so easy to use especially since you can use regular trashbags vs. genie refills and the diaper is gone w/ a flip of a handle!! My son is 9 months old and we have NO SMELL PROBLEMS!!! I don't know how some people can complain about smells coming from this thing...it's sealed up like Ft. Knox. You never see the inside of the pail until you empty it. The canister pushes the diaper into the trashbag, thus never allowing odors to escape through the pail. I would have to say the only way you may have an odor problem is if you never empty it!!!!!!!!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is my second child. With my first, I went through the Diaper Genie and hated it ---her nursery always smelled, even though my husband regularly changed that annoying (and expensive refill, $5.00 for each refill adds up faster than you think!) diaper system, he even took it outside and hosed it down with Clorox bleach and sprayed it regularly with Lysol -- to no avail.We also tried the Neat Diaper disposal system, and it's pretty and works a little better than the Genie, but it still smells up the room.  The Diaper Champ wins hands down, I for one never had an odor problem and I love the fact that it's easy to use and easy to empty, it's also easy to dispose of the diaper with one hand (especially when you're holding and infant and don't want to leave a smelly diaper out of the pail), something I couldn't do with neither the Genie not the Neat pail.I highly recommend it!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diperchamp is easy to use, as other people have said. We bought it with our first child, but stopped using it before she turned one. It does not keep the smell in and with only one stinky diper in there my daughter's entire room would smell the moment you walked in.I really loved the diperchamp when she was a newborn and her dipers did not smell. Now that we are pregnant with our second child I am not planning on using it again because we did not use it for very long.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I like BabyTrend's products. We also have a SnapNGo, and we also seriously considered the Trend High Chair. We've been using the Diaper Champ for almost a year now since our baby was born. I think it does what it advertises and that is that it does a good job of keeping in the odors (we live in a 1 bedroom condo). Pros: easy to use one-hand drop-in mechanism, good odor trapping, can use just about any kind of grocery or plastic bag, convenient handle, and easy to clean. Cons: kind of bulky and heavy even when empty, difficult to open lid for changing. Hint: If using spray cleaning, don't spray water into the drop-in hole. The mechanism is not completely watertight and you'll trap some water in there. Myself, I've actually done a thorough cleaning only twice. Most times I just spray Lysol inside after changing to a new plastic bag.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I registered for this product after reading the reviews, and I have to say I was very disappointed.  You are better off just getting a garbage pail with a tight lid.  Not only did my daughter's room smell horrible, but I broke three finger nails trying to lift the lid.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ doesn't smell - how wonderful!  Also, there are no expensive bags to buy for it - you can use regular plastic bags!  Although it seems to fill up quickly(diapers tend to pile up in the middle), this is an absolute must!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I can't say enough good things about the Champ.  For my first son we had the Diaper Genie - but it didn't do the trick. (too $$ and too difficult to handle).For son #2, I read the reviews and decided to give this one a try.  I still love it!  My son (who is now 3+ years old) is finally getting potty trained, but we still use it to hold the ""nightie night dypes""...  We've been using it for 3+ years and it is still going strong.According to the reviews, I was careful to wrap the diapers before putting them in - which we had to do for the Genie anyway... For the REALLY MESSY ones, I flipped up the lid and placed it right in the bag - which was easy to do.My son still loves to pull the handle and say ""bye-bye"" to what he considers the magic trash can.  For me, the only time I experience an odor is when I change the bags. If the odor inside gets too strong, try using Febreeze -- it even works on the plastic!Strongly MOM Approved!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"It is so much easier to use than the Diaper Genie (my sister has that) but it does have some problems.  We've used it for a year now, and it never started to smell until the diapers did.  It generally only smells when it's really full or you're emptying it out.  I wouldn't say the smell is such a problem though.  Whenever I empty out the bag (love the fact you can use regular trash bags) I would wipe out the inside and saturate it with Lycol for disinfecting.  The only reason why I am going to have to buy the Diaper Genie now is that my 1 year old loves to put items (sippy cups, toys, etc.) into the hole in the top and flip the handle.  I didn't realize he could do this until one day when a sippy cup went missing, and after EXTENSIVE searching I found it inside the diaper pail!  Since then, I have caught him many times trying to do the same thing.  Over all, it's a good product.  I think if you smell strong odors coming from the Diaper Champ, it's time to clean and empty it!",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,My husband and I registered for the Diaper Champ without really knowing much about it.  We picked it because it did not require purchasing refills like the Diaper Genie (which my sister-in-law had and did not really like).  We really like our Diaper Champ because it does not require refills (it uses regular kitchen trash bags)and it keeps out odor completely.  I am recommending this to all my pregnant friends.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My son is now 18 months old and I have to say that the diaper champ is one of our favorite purchases! We got it when I was pregnant in hopes it would keep our house smelling ok. Well, it does pretty well at that, you still have to change it out everyday, it is poop however!!! But the thing I love most is that I can just use my kroger bags!! With buying diapers and toys, I didn't need something else on my list to buy! What a great invention!!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"... than deal with the odor from this pail.  Even changing the whole bag (we tried plastic grocery sacks, tall kitchen bags, even heavy duty garbage bags) every day didn't help.  We've moved this product to the garage and purchased a Diaper Genie for the nursery.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I LOVED my Champ for the first year as it was all I expected in ease, cleanliness, odor free with regular bag changes and the economical use of kitchen bags.  Then the liner began to come loose and get stuck in the tumbler and eventually had to be removed altogether making things a bit less odor resistant, but still manageable with regular bag changes, cleanings, airings and sprinklings of baking soda.  The real problem we have now is that no amount of cleaning and deoderizing the Champ after a bag change (about twice a week for us) has managed to eliminate the strong odor that seems to be clinging to the actual pail now.  We've tried a number of disinfectants, deoderizers and air freshners, but they are no match for the offensive odor of the Champ even when clean and empty.  We are so disappointed in the short-term success of this product.  It has been removed from my son's room and we are now taking each diaper out individually and looking for another pail.  I am really interested in finding another &quot;use-any-trashbag&quot; style for sake of our finances.  In light of our experience with the Champ, I'd have to recommend not purchasing this pail unless you are prepared to replace it when it fails to do it's no-odor diaper duty in due time.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have a two-year-old son and I love the Diaper Champ. We initially bought a Diaper Genie and used it for the first 9 months or so, but we really disliked it. It was difficult to use, loud, and then broke on us. We switched the Diaper Champ and love it. It contains our toddler's odors just fine. We change the bag once a week and when we change a diaper we make sure to roll it up tightly and use the sticky tabs to close it up.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I bought this after being gievn a diaper genie as a gift. This is much easier to use. You can use any type of trash bag with this versus the diaper genie where you have to purchase their expensive bags. I highly recommend the diaper champ for storing stinky diapers.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,This is a great product and a good value for those on a budjet.  Using lysol after changing the bag works well.  I have used my Diaper champ for 3 years and it still works!! I recommed this product to everyone I know.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I also opted for the Diaper Champ because there isn't any refills. It is very easy to use, but is difficult to open. I'm afraid of ripping a fingernail completely off everytime I change the bag. My problem is with odor control. There isn't any. My newborn daughter's room smells constantly. It only takes ONE poopy diaper to smell. Yes we do change the bag regularly per other posts. We had to keep a fan on in her room during the summer just to keep the odor from a choking level. No exaggeration! If the smell wasn't a problem, I'd completely recommend this product.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,It's so much better then the diaper genie. No special bags necessary! Occasionally there are some bad odors but it's nothing that can't be fixed with some febreeze or lysol!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My baby's room has absolutely NO odor because of the Diaper Champ.  The chamber holds many diapers ( a day full at least) with no odor at all.  I also love that it takes regular trash bags so it's economical.  I spray the top and handle daily with Lysol or use Clorox wipes in the receptacle to keep it sanitary, but otherwise NO ODORS leak out!  We change the trash bag daily but you could get away with two days.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I read a review below that can explain exactly what we experienced. We've had it for 16 months and it has worked wonderful for us. No smells, change it out once a week, easy to clean. Then a diaper snagged this foam material in the head part, so I pulled the rest of the foam out. Big mistake!!! Now it can no loner retain the stinkiness and we're looking for a replacement. Be careful of overloading and never take out that foam piece that is cushioned between pieces. I have figured out that it is key to keeping the stink out.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,This thing freakin' stinks. Literally. I changed the bags every 1-2 days and wiped with clorox wipes and sprayed with lysol AND used vanilla scented bagsand we could still smell the smells seeping through!! Now I just throw the diapers in the regular trash since I change the bags everyday anyway and we can't smell a thing now. Someone else told me this thing stinks and I should have listened to them.,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Almost bought a diaper genie and then read on-line reviews.  Glad we listened!  Very easy to use.  Easy to open to empty and easy to replace trash bags. Nice that you can use regular trash bags from any store.  So far, keeps odor out except when changing the bag.JUST ONE BAD THING...The only reason why we gave it only 4 stars is because sometimes wipes and even the velcro diaper tabs get caught in the space on the sides when flipping the handle to dump the diaper in the canister.  If you look at the picture you might understand.  After you flip the handle, the diaper on the inside goes into the bag when the cylinder you place it in is vertical, or completely upside down.  On the sides, there are walls that are snug to the round part that flips around. It is between the round diaper flipper thing and the walls that stuff could potentially get caught.  It is hard to get stuff out of this space.We've only noticed something in this space once or twice. We still recommend this product.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We've had the Diaper Champ for 18 months, and it worked great, no smells, very easy to use, until recently.  Somehow (probably it got overloaded) the adhesive from a diaper snagged the foam that insulates the head of the champ and pulled just the teeniest tiniest corner out.  Once some poop got on that mesh/foam insulation, it soaked through, and now there is NO hope for the Diaper Champ.  We're going to get another, but just BEWARE -- these can fail.  Check you Champ carefully to make sure that no mesh or foam are visible.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"If you really want to save money, but still get a quality product, buy the Diaper Champ.I had a friend recommend it to me, and another friend recommend the Diaper Dekor.  When it came down to it, I couldn't make myself spend the extra money for something that needed expensive refills. Every time you have to buy refills, it is almost as expensive as buying a new diaper pail.  Let's face it, babies are expensive and whenever you can save $ you should!!!I buy a box of bags at Target that I use for the kitchen and the Diaper Champ and they cost less than ten dollars for over 100 bags.My only complaint is that it is hard to get the pail open at first to change the bags, but it gets easier over time as it loosens up and you get the hang of it!If I had it to do over again, I would still buy the Diaper Champ!  I think it is great!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have one for the nursery and one downstairs in what we call our ""satellite"" nursery where we keep our pack & play. My daughter is nearly 8 mos now, and we use both of them pretty equally. However, the one in the nursery is smelly, the one downstairs you can't detect the slightest odor from. We change both of them out at least 2-3x/week. I tried cleaning out the smelly one, getting the foam soaked with lysol and letting it dry out in the hot LV sun - I figured the scorching heat alone would kill anything, but I can still detect an odor from it - it doesn't stink up the whole nursery, but if you're standing right next to it you get a whiff. The foam inside has just absorbed the stink and there's no getting rid of it. All of this being said, I don't know that there is any other diaper pail that is much better - my brother has a diaper genie and he says it stinks a lot, he has to change his every day. My girlfriend has tried a few different pails and doesn't think any one is better than another.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband and I wanted this style (vs. the Diaper Genie) because it uses regular kitchen trash bags.  This is a more efficient way to go both because you can buy these bags anywhere and they are less expensive compared to the specialty bags for the Genie.  The unique hopper design allows one-handed use and keeps smells from permeating the nursery.  Overall, we are very pleased with our purchase and recommend it highly.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I just read the great reviews about this product and am very surprised to hear people don't have problem with the smell.  I have had the Diaper Champ for 16 months now, and think it is pretty cost effective, compare to the Diaper Genie, but frankly I am considering buying something else, cause it really does not keep the odors in.  We have to change the bag every couple of days, when it is not even full because it is pretty disgusting.So just because of that I would not recommend it.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The reason their are mixed reviews on the Diaper Champ is because not all Diaper Champs are created equal (hee, hee).  We purchased one and we loved it.  No odor, we loved that you could use any bag, we were very happy.  So happy, we bought a second one.  OH MY GAH!  It was horrid.  The odors were so strong we thought our nursery maybe toxic (not really, smile).  We thought maybe it was just us, so we called in for a second opinion (the Mother-in-law).  She started gagging, and that was our sign to bring in the gas masks and rid of the Diaper Champ.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Bottom line: Using regular bags saves big time $$$.  In just a few months use, the Diaper Champ pays for itself by saving money on costly refills needed for other brands.  I have never had an odor problem, but I have a 5-month-old breastfed baby, so I know her diapers now are not as stinky as they will get once we go to solids.  I also use the Glad ""Odor-Control"" bags (the price of 100 bags is probably about the same as a DG RF and will last over a year).  The Diaper Champ is also very easy to use and easy to change bags.  I highly recommend it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have never written a review for Amazon but I saw some of the poor reviews on the Diaper Champ and had to add my two cents . . .When my sister got pregnant she could not decide if she should register for the Diaper Champ or the Diaper Genie.  She left it up to me and after reviewing both items I went with the Diaper Champ . . .  The idea of having to continually purchase bags for the Diaper Genie seemed like a waste when the Diaper Champ lets you use any type of bag . . .  My nephew is now over two years old and while he has begun potty training, my sister still uses the Diaper Champ I gave her . . .When it came time for me to choose a diaper disposal system, I put the Diaper Champ on my registry.  Yes, it can be a bit tricky to open (I found using two hands works best) but then again do I want something that is holding wet and otherwise dirty diapers to open easily?  True, the mechanism sometimes won't ""swing"" the dirty diaper into the pail but HELLO that is a sign that it is probably time to put in a new bag.  Yes, it can eventually start to smell if you don't change it regularly . . . but then again if you used a metal safe lined with carbon to hold your kids diapers eventually baby poop and pee smell would emanate from it if you didn't clean it out regularly . . . Realistically the thing holds dirty stinky diapers and yep it is going to smell when you open it but hey . . . my kids tush smells when I wipe it but I still love him :)My personal tip . . . if you belong to a wholesale club like BJ's, Costco or Sam's check to see if they have the Glad Kitchen Bags.  The BJ's we shop in has a box of 200 for $9.99.  As long as you do not attempt to overstuff them (i.e., get lazy and don't change the bag regularly) they work perfectly.  I also use them in the small garbage pails in our apartment.  I could wait for a sale and use a coupon (the way I shop for most things) but it takes months to go through the box and I like knowing they are always on hand . . . At about $.05 a bag, the super duper box of bags makes my life easy and that as any parent knows is ***PRICELESS***.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,After reading how great this product was on the convenience of not having to but those expensive bags ( diaper genie) I registered for the diaper champ. What a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. The smell is HORRIFYING!!!! Needless to say I am now going to buy the diaper genie and those expensive bags. I shoudn't have the gag reflex every time I enter my daughters nursery. I strongly recommend that you DON""T buy the diaper CHUMP......,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This pail is  by far the best!  Great price, no special bags, high capacity, easy to use and most importantly...no odor!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Hands down....get this diaper pail... The only reason I ever even need to empty it is when it cant hold anymore! NEVER smells..ever! I change mine about every 2 weeks, like I said, only because thats when it seems to fill. Dont bother w/ the cheapies, this one is IT! Seriously....trust me! The reason why it never smells is because the diaper goes into like a seperate chamber before it gets to the bag, so the air never transfers.Theres nothing else I can say. This is perfection.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I admit when I was an expecting father one of my concerns was diaper changing, mostly because of the odors (anyone with me on this one?) As much as the odors won't go away during changing time, they do -as a matter of fact- dissapear once you throw the dirty diaper in the Diaper Champ. Put it in the top hole, roll the top with the handle, in the diaper goes and bye-bye to all odor!As if this were not already great, there's a big plus to this product, when you compare it to its biggest competitor, the Diaper Genie by Playtex. Although this one costs $5 the first time around, it won't require special bags as the Genie does, which cost $15 per set... this one takes your standard Glad bags you can get in Costco, BJs, Sam's or your local supermarket, so rejoice! (for diaper odors are over when the diaper goes in); and don't spend too much money to accomplish such a mundane task: make sure you get your Diaper Champ!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I LOOOVE this diaper pail!  Its the easiest to use!  after using the diaper genie for 2 months i decided i had enough with the refils and with how much of a pain it is to use.  I purchases this diaper pail in its place and i loooove it!  No more refills, it uses the same bags as my kitchen garbage!  And it holds alot more! I only have to empty it like once a week as oppsed to every other day with the diaper genie.  This is worth the few extra buck because you arnt spending 5 more bucks every othe rweek for refills!  I have a bunch of poopy diapers in mine and you cant even smell them! and i love the fact that you dont have to open it to put a diaper in so i can do it one handed.  Just toss the diaper in the top and flip over the handle, its sooo easy!  And with the diaper genie i noticed that the smell would leak out a bit when you opened the top.  It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!  I would definatly recommend this product to anyone looking to buy a diaper pail!!!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I received the Diaper Champ as a gift when my baby girl was born last year.  At first it seemed as the perfect way to keep diaper smells away; it worked like a charm.  Within four to five months it started to smell, it did not seal properly and the smell got impregnated on the plastic, it was impossible to get rid of it.  I tried to wash it, spray it, scrub it, but nothing.  Maybe the sealing system fades with use.  I used it till I couldn't anymore and two months ago bought the Diaper Genie.  Yes, you have to buy refils ... it does a great job a sealing smells.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My son and daughter-in-law requested this item and they are very pleased with it.  For their last child they used another brand, and  were dissatisfied.  However, they love the Diaper Champ.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Bought this on amazon. Never saw it around. Went through 3 kids. Very well madeNever would smell poopy diapers. Just use a store plastic bag and then when it's full, justThrow away. Love it !",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ is TERRIBLE at keeping the smelly diapers from only smelling in the container.  Our baby's room was constantly stinky (due to the Diaper Champ, not the baby!), and we were having to empty the container almost daily.  What's the point of having a diaper disposal system if you can't dispose of diapers efficiently?  Please don't buy this product unless you enjoy smelling those dirty diapers.  The Diaper Champ just doesn't work.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We researched all of the different types of diaper pails, including the Diaper Genie which some of our friends have, but this one takes the cake. Not only do you not have to buy special bags, the ease of use is phenomenal. Park this thing right next to the changing table, and just drop the diaper in as you go. When you are done, just pull the handle from one side to the other, and presto, you're done. It holds around 15-20 diapers (I have changed it probably twice a week), and you just open it, tie the bag and take it out. To make sure there is no smell eminating from it, we put a box of Arm & Hammer in the bottom and use scented garbage bags- and there is NO BAD SMELL AT ALL! I highly recommend that. And you don't need top of the line bags, just get some scented off-brand bags (I got 30 for $3), and you should be all set. I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a simple solution. You don't need the Genie. My best friend has one, and not only does it stink (literally), the whole ""special bag"" thing irks me. Give this guy a try. I am so glad we did!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Clean, economical, simple. Never experienced any odor ""problems""; we just empty the receptacle every other day.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I laughed when my husband wanted this product.  I felt it was  a waste of money and that you could just throw the diapers in the garage.  Well thats not a good idea.  We have the diaper champ and never smell anything.  This is a great item that every parent needs.  Its easy to use, and you can use your own bags. We actually use kitchen bags, and they hold quite a few diapers. We only have to change the bag out about once a week. I can't say enough great things about the diaper champ.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,You cannot imagine how much money you'll save and it doesn't smell AT ALL!!! You can use any kitchen size garbage bags without a problem and use it for A WEEK without having to change the bag. IT'S WONDERFULL!!!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I bought this trying to save a few dollars and when I received it I thought it felt and looked real junky. After using it for over a week I have to admit I was wrong. I have 2 babies in diapers and the Diaper Champ keeps their room smelling GREAT. It is extremely easy to use and it has the added advantage that one can use ANY plastic bag with the Champ.It is an all around great, helpful and inexpensive product.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"As a Mother of 9 month old twins, I go through plenty of diapers.  We're moving to the U.K. in a couple of weeks, and after not being able to find a 'Champ' anywhere overseas, I'm having one shipped to our new home.  We've never had a problem with smell, or operation, and love that we can use the bags we choose and not be tied down to brand-specific refill bags.  I highly recommend this product to anyone!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I wanted this diaper pail over the Genie b/c I liked the idea of being able to use standard trash bags instead of special refills, plus I have NEVER been able to get a Diaper Genie to easily work!  Now that I have the Champ, I'm glad I got it, because it's very easy to use, however there are a few things I don't like about it:1.  It's hard to get the lid open...I've broken several nails and hurt my hand trying to pop the latch open.2.  Because of the funky ring on the inside that I haven't yet determined the purpose of, the diapers get clogged near the top so that the handle can't be turned.  There is generally more than enough room left in the trash bag, so in order to avoid changing a bag that is only a third of the way full, I have to open the lid and adjust the pile of diapers or rock the pail back and forth so the diapers fall and I can continue filling.3.  A diaper got jammed in it once when the sticky tab stuck to the foam seal in the plunger.  The only way I was able to dislodge it was to tear out the seal.  The pail still works fine, but now the plunger is loose so it bangs around when you turn the handle, which makes more noise than before.4.  I have noticed a smell on occasion, but I expected as much...it's a plastic can full of poop...it's not going to smell like roses!!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I like some features of the Diaper Champ. I do not find that it is odorless at all. I do like the one-handed operation of it. However, my toddler is constantly putting things in it and I have to paw through the dirty diapers to see what he's thrown away before I dispose of the bag. Using regular trash bags is nice, but I think there is something to be said for scented liners.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"For some reason, Amazon first sent us this product used...complete with poop stains!  We were very disappointed but they redeemed themselves by sending us a brand new one.  Now we are very happy with it.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,We gave away our Diaper Genie and bought 2 of these when our second child was born. You use regular garbage bags and it takes less than a minute to change. No bad smells - no expensive liners. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,We've been using the Diaper Champ for almost 5 months now and love it. It works like advertised and keeps the odors at bay. I would recommend hosing the inside with Lysol after each bag change.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Wow!  This is fabulous.  It was a toss-up between the Diaper Genie and this one, and we decided on the Diaper Champ since you didn't need refill bags to go with it.  I go through a TON of diapers a day (I have twins) and instead of making a hundred trips to the trash can in the garage to get the poopie stink out of the house, I use this...and it works!  Absolutely no smell escapes from the Diaper Champ and I can use plain kitchen garbage bags in it.  We're very pleased with ours.  Spend the extra five dollars on this diaper disposer rather than settle for the ""Genie"".",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have a friend that had the Diaper Genie and complained of it smelling on occasion.  My husband and I were a little leary of purchasing a diaper pail, but decided to give the Diaper Champ a try!  I am so glad that we did!  We have been using it for almost a month and it is great!  It is so easy to use, never smells (so far) and I love that you can use your own garbage bags and do not have to purchase special bags to use with this diaper pail!  I would definetely recommend!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We liked this diaper pail because it uses regular trash bags.  It definatly keeps the smell contained, but, it will only hold about 15 to 20 dirty diapers before it gets clogged up.  When it is full, the lid won't turn over without some force.  This is a minor annoyance and it just needs to be emptied more often.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"It's true, it does not work as well as the diaper genie. I am going back to that. I have used both and I can assure you, this product does not contain smells - I even put it in the closet, and still we smell it! Save yourself the money.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I chose this pail because I didn't want to spend alot on a daiper pail.  In the end, I spent more because I had to buy a different one.  After only a few months of using it, the seal broke and  the odor came through.  The latch would get stuck making it difficult to change the bag.  This is certainly not worth buying!!",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This may look fancy, but does not control soiled diapers odors, only wet diapers odors.  You are better off buying a trash can with a lid.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This odor absorbing champ even absorbs the odors from those diaper genies down the street...  My one step diaper champ sure beats the 5 steps it takes to twist a diaper in the that genie.  Who want to do extra when you are doing enough as it is? - The CHAMP is icing on the cake - every mommy gets psyched when their boy (or girl) poops because it means everything is working... and when you toss that diaper into the the mini R2D2 unit, you know you did it right... simplicity... ahh...",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This was great for first 5 months of my baby girl. But now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using airfreshner. First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor. Bottom line if you buy this for your newborn, it is fine. But be prepared to buy something else (diaper genie ?) which can trap the odor better.I am now looking at the diaper genie.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Very easy to use, no smells at all. No special bags to buy. An easy decision.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I think this should be a staple in every household with a child!  It is so much easier to use than the diaper genie and the other brands.  The fact that you can use regular trash bags is a BIG plus because you don't have to stock up on refill's or run to the store when you realize you don't have anymore.  There is no oder (until you open it up to empty) and it is easy to use..great item!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,Excellent product. Holds nearly a week of soiled diapers without release of any unpleasant odor.  Easy to operate to release and discard soiled diapers.  Would recommend that others purchase.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We love the Diaper Champ, just wish it could hold more diapers! Really, I can't smell anything once the diaper is in there and it's very easy to load and unload. Plus, the price can't be beat.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love this product. You can use any regular trash bag. So far we have noticed NO odors. It is easy to use. It fills up somewhat quickly, but you can make it last longer by wrapping diapers tightly before placing in the champ. The price is very affordable as well.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I received the Diaper Champ at my baby shower and have been using it since day one.  I loved it when I got it and now that I have used it for 1 1/2 years, I still love it!(First of all, if you have a poop smearing issue in your Diaper Champ, it's because you don't know how to roll a diaper closed and seal it with the tabs.  That's just gross, sorry I had to go there.)  Now that I have made my previous comment, even after the weight of the plunger pushed the diaper down, I have never had the issue of a ""dirty"" plunger.  The only cleaning I do to mine is wipe it down with a Clorox wipe once a week and spray it out with Lysol disinfectant spray everytime I change the bag.  I also use Glad Odor Shield kitchen bags in mine and I have never had an odor problem.My Diaper Champ is still in great condition, never had a broken part and never had a reason to need to take it a part.I would HIGHLY reccomend this to anyone who needs a WONDERFUL diaper pail.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is one of the best things that we got as a shower present. It requires no additional expense, other than regular trash bags (unlike the diaper genie) and it really works! I was skeptical that it blocked odors as claimed, but I am convinced: I forgot to change a full bag of dirty diapers before we left for a week of vacation (we have no a/c and it was really hot that week) ...We came home a week later and our daughter's room didn't smell bad at all.I do use Glad trash bags with the odor guard, wipe it out occasionally with Clorox wipes and I do keep a drier sheet in the bottom of the diaper champ just to ensure that it remains ""nice"" ... but that's more about keeping it clean than anything else.Bottom line, the diaper champ is something that we absolutely couldn't and still can't live without!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I've tried the two other most popular diaper pails and am happiest with this one.  It is easy to change the bag, uses any trash bag, and does a decent job of containing odor.  I really appeciate all of these things after dealing with the other brands.  I would highly suggest using this one from the very beginning.  Let's face it....no diaper pail is perfect, but this one is the best that I've used.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Ok, so the idea of the Diaper Champ is awesome--it is very easy to use--that's why I gave it 1 star. However...the thing REALLY stinks!! Someone gave me the Neat diaper disposal system for my baby shower & I absolutely loved it. However, the handle broke on it just 2 weeks ago. I thought...""Maybe I could try the Diaper Champ since I won't have to purchase any liners""...Well that was a HUGE mistake!! I see why this thing got 4 stars--all of these parents have young children!! My daughter is 14 months old & because she is older, I guess her diapers come with more odor! After literally only a few diapers, her entire room smelled of poop! I couldn't stand it! In one week, I changed the garbage bag at least 4 times. Is that really saving money?? I don't think so! Plus her room really smelled bad. I'm taking it back & getting the Neat again! The Diaper Champ must be great for infants, but you may want to consider something else for older babies!",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We opted to register for this diaper pail because it didn't require costly refills.  It seemed to work well at first, although the changing of bags was a bit of a pain.  By the time my son was 8 months old, the pail began to stink a lot.  We always wiped it down and sprayed it with Lysol.  Eventually, a piece of foam from inside (I'm guessing this helped to keep the smells inside) came loose.  We finally had to throw it out when my son was 9 1/2 months old. My neighber who had a baby at the same time also owned the Champ and had to toss her's out when her daughter was 5 months old.  The same thing happened to her.We are now expecting our second child and are in the process of buying a new pail - probably the Neat System.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I got the diaper champ at my baby shower and used it from the begining.  It was wonderful, it didn't smell and it held LOTS of diapers.  I was glad I got it after finding out from my sister that she had to replace her bag from her diaper genie every other day in the begining and then a least 2 times a week when my neice was older.  At $6 a bag I saved a ton of money with this product.  However now that my daughter is a year and on all regular adult foods the diaper champ isn't holding in the smell very well at all.  I've been replacing the bag every day to prevent the smell from getting too bad but it's a pain to do so I'm thinking about getting a different diaper disposal system for now.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is such an easy and clean way to dispose of dirty diapers! Quick, one hand operation & NO odor problems!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Champ is a great diaper disposal system, but smells do leak out.  As soon as you open the system to take the bag out, all of those diapers do smell up the place!  I can not say that I am 100% satisfied with this type of disposal system, I just wish there was a better way of taking out the bag without smelling up the entire room!",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,Great diaper pail. It is very simple. Uses any bag. I haven't had any problems at all with it and it holds odor extremely well (until you open it!) But all in all a great diaper pail....definitely recommend!!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I did love this product for the first year. but my oldest is 3years old and we've been through two of these and now off to buy something else for my 15 month old. The seal on the cover doesn't last long which is why it smells. When we first get the new one it works great for a few months and then it starts smelling. We change it every other day and my 3 year old is potty trained so I'm only using it with one toddler. The fact that you don't need to buy special bags is great but I wish they would figure out a better way to contain the smells.,3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We bought this one because it can be used with cloth or disposable diapers and uses regular (ie. cheap) garbage bags.  For cloth diapers, you can even use a laundry bag.  Since we are using both cloth and disposables, we have two!  The system works great and there is no noticeable smell (although our son is a breastfed baby, so smell is at a minimum anyway).  We did have a problem with one of them in that the lining that makes it airtight is starting to come loose, but my husband said that the velcro from the diaper got stuck on it.  Make sure the velcro is fastened before turning the handle to dispose of the diaper (and make sure your husband does this as well!).  I have heard that you shouldn't dispose of loose wipes without putting them in the diaper first.  Since we are using cloth diapers, we often throw the disposable wipes in the disposable pail loose without a diaper and have had no problems so far!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"While the diaper champ is not perfect, it is really good! No special bags to buy! One hand diaper disposal and very easy to clean! I change the bag 2-3 times a week and before I put a new bag back in I use mr.clean and clean it up real good. No odors and really easy!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I've worked with kids more than half my life. First as a babysitter /nanny and now as a mother. I've used diaper genies and they've all been really smelly. I never had to deal with changing cartridges but I can imagine how annoying it could be to open that stench-filled object and take out the poop sausage. I love my diaper champ. It's so easy to use. I never had a problem with it squishing my finger because I always remember that the lid is heavy. No smell escapes from it and I keep it in my bathroom. We'll see if I still love it once my DD's soiled diapers become stinky.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have owned a Diaper Dekor and now a Diaper Champ.  I prefer the Diaper Champ because it does not utilize expensive refills and it keeps the odor in better than the Diaper Dekor.  The Diaper Dekor broke, the arm that lifts the lid up broke off.  So I had to go searching for a new product again since they discontinued the model that I was using.  I chose the Diaper Champ because it only takes one hand to use, I can use regular bags, it holds more diapers and it keeps the odor in check.  Let's face it, even the best can't keep in that smell, especially as your child gets older.  I have two children now, so the Diaper Champ is getting utilized quite a bit and it beats the competition hands down.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is much better than the Genie, it doesn't smell as bad if you take your trash out on a regular basis.  The only way I can keep it from smelling is to put a cloth wet with pine-sol in the bottom.  This generally works for 3 or 4 days. However, the capacity is not that great especially if you have twins!  (But what is except for a 33 gallon trash can with a hole in the top!)  The capacity is really the only thing I can complain about, even with one baby it seemed to fill up pretty fast.  It is convient, no twisting, turning, or shoving the diapers like you have to with the Genie.  And the use of any bag is great, too!  Although, it seems to tear everytime I change it.  Overall, for the price and for one baby, it's not too bad.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I researched all the available options and decided to try the Diaper Champ instad of diaper genie. It made diaper disposal a snap!! The one handed disposal was soo convenient when i was holding a squirmy baby with one arm. It is smell free if you empty frequently and almost so if you don't. This thing lived next to my sidetable for the first few months and often it was only emptied when it was full (its pretty large). I used some simple tricks to prevent smell leakage:-Rolled and taped up the diapers securely before disposing-Always returned the handle to original position so that only one side of the opening stayed in contact with smelly diapers (you'll know what i mean when you use it)-Used scented odor lock GLAD bags and aired out the champ between bag changesThe only cons I found were that opening it is a bit tough ( you get more adept at it though and its safer) and there is a small opening below the handle which is where the odor tends to escape when it does.The cons are pretty minor given how well this thing works AND it is cost effective...i hate the idea of being forced to buy brand specific refills. It may seem bulky and not great to look at but I have to admit i have at times emptied the champ only when it could not take a single more diaper. I almost returned this when i opened it and saw how large it was but i am so glad i kept it!!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband and I love the Diaper Champ - it makes diaper changes quick and easy. We make sure to wrap up all the dirty wipes in the dirty diaper before depositing it, so it doesn't get stuck in the shoot. Each time the bag is full, we empty the pail, spray Lysol inside and out, and replace the bag. We've had it for almost 3 months now, and can't complain.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This product has been great.  It's easy to use, holds plenty of dirty diapers, takes any kind of bag (this is important!), and does not take up too much space.Once in a while the drum gets stuck, but that's only when the pail is too full.Great product!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We bought this over the Genie because you could use regular kitchen bags and with a greater capacity you wouldn't have to change the bag as often.  I was wrong on the last point.  Because it doesn't keep odor in as well, you really still need to change the bag often.  This from a mom with a breastfed baby, and supposedly breastmilk diapers have less odor.  In addition, it is a little tricky to open and close the bin.  The blue insert that holds the bag in can be difficult to manipulate.  No big deal.  I am still glad we chose this over the Genie, all things considered.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I cannot believe that anyone has had good luck with this product.  I have emailed Baby Trend for a refund so I can go buy something else.  I am even nursing my daughter and the stench from her &quot;odorless&quot; pail is horrific.  I cannot believe they didn't make a space for a deodorizer.  I'm pretty shocked at how bad it is!,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I don't think this pail really did everything I was expecting, which was based on the content they provided on their site.  I had a hard time opening and closing it, and honestly the smells containment was not any greater than a normal trash bin.  Cute design, but not worthy of higher expectations.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I had tried a Diaper Genie at a friend's house and wasn't really impressed with how it worked, not to mention the idea of having to buy refills.  I registered for the Diaper Champ primarily because you could use regular kitchen trash bags instead of special refills, and all the good reviews it seemed to get.  I could not be happier with the Champ!  It is truly the easiet thing in the world to use--one hand is all you need.  We have not noticed an odor problem at all.  Yes, it might briefly smell when you change out the pail but I can't imagine other systems aren't the same way.  I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone having a baby!  It is by far the best thing I received as a shower gift.  You won't be disappointed in the Champ!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This product was great for the first couple months.  It IS very easy to use, there's no twisting or struggling with the special bags, but when your little one starts foods and their mess gets a little more stinky, this pail does nothing to contain the odor.Here's the problem...there's no seal on the lid.  Where the lid opens to get the bags in and out, it's plastic against plastic that's not even remotely air tight that constantly leaks the stench of the inside.  Also, the chamber where you place the diaper gives you a waft of diaper pail air each time you flip it.I'm realistic that it IS a diaper pail and is it going to smell, but this product could do a much better job.  I DO empty mine at least once a week, wipe it with disinfecting wipes, spray it with lysol and let it air out for at least one day before it goes back in her room.  The problem is, you just can't get to all the surfaces in the top of the pail.  I spend more time struggling with this thing, cleaning it, and airing it out than is realistic.Save your money on this one.  The cost of not having to buy the diaper genie bags is not worth smell in my little darling's nursery.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I nannied for two babies in some one else's home and they have the Diaper Champ. I think the reason parents don't smell the diapers when using this product is because they get used to the smell!! I would think that the poopy diapers were fine in this diaper pail until the parents would come home and ask why it smelled so bad in their house! Finally, I had to start using the ""champ"" for wet diapers only and walk the poopy diapers out to the street garbage can. Although I'm sure that this is better than throwing the diapers in your house garbage, there has to be something with some better odor control!",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We did alot of research on diaper pails before our first child was born.  We knew a few couples with the Diaper Genie, and one couple with the Diaper Champ.  The couple with the Diaper Champ has a baby that is 3 months older than our child.  This couple liked their Champ just fine, saying they noticed no odors.  We also read tons of reviews, mainly here on Amazon, of both products.  And from the reviews, it seemed there were many happy customers of both products.  So we decided, if they were about equal, we would go with the more convenient and cheaper solution, the Champ.Well, we were pretty happy for about 4 to 6 months.  We very much liked that we could use our regular trash bags.  And changing the Champ's bag is very easy.  But after our child was well into eating solids, at about 7 months, the smell became unbearable.  It really is true that babies' poops really start to stink much, much worse when they eat lots of solids.  So we went out and bought a Diaper Genie, and are now very happy with the Genie.  The Genie has 2 big advantages over the Champ, in regards to smell control.  1) Each diaper is contained in its own litte pouch via the Genie's twisting mechanism.  2)  The filler bags progress in thickness, so as your child gets older, and her poops get smellier, you can get thicker, better bags.After using the Genie for about a month now, we are very pleased.  The Champ is essentially a simple waste pail with a fancy hood.  The hood and ordinary trash bags don't do much for odor prevention.  The drawbacks to the Genie though, are that you must buy their fillers, and the bag changing mechanism is much more complicated than the Champ's.  We thought these were worth dealing with to prevent the odors.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We registered for the diaper champ after comparing it with the diaper genie and diaper dekor at the store.  We had used the diaper genie while working in the church nursery and found it to be extremely difficult to use with the number of diapers we were changing there.  Now our own baby is four months old, and we have loved having the diaper champ at home.  It is so easy to use and does not stink, or at least it hasn't yet.  We use Ruffies scented garbage bags and change the bag when full, about every five days.  I would definitely recommend the diaper champ.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I love this diaper pail!  It's so easy to use and I haven't had any problems with diaper odors.  I love that you can use any bag for the inside instead of being forced to buy the more expensive refills.  Save yourself some money and hassle and buy the Diaper Champ!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband and I decided to buy this because we did not want to be tied down to any expensive refills. We are very happy with our decision. It is odorless, easy to operate and holds good amount of diapers.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The champ is great because you don't have to waste anymore money buying expensive refills like the diaper genie.  This one uses regular bags (I use 32 gallon bags).  I did have some problems with the odor, but I think anything you put poop in and let sit for days will have odor so that's inevitable!  Here's some tricks for this Champ:1.  Put an Arm & Hammer Baking Soda box at the bottom of the pail to help eliminate orders.  And the obvious, change the bag every couple days to eliminate the smell... don't expect to leave it there for a week and have it smell like roses!2.  The side straps of the diaper will get caught in the shoot so make sure you roll the diaper really tight and use the straps to hold it together, otherwise your diaper shoot will get clogged.3.  If you're like me, you probably have tons of grocery bags laying around.  Keep a few handy in the nursery and use them to bag the poopy diapers.  Double bagging them helps to eliminate the orders.Hope this helps!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I just wanted to say that I love my Diaper Champ (I use it with my Fuzzi Bunz cloth diapers) and I have never had a problem with smell. I think it also makes a big difference whether or not you breastfeed or artificially feed. I only breastfeed so I never have a problem.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We bought the diaper champ, because we heard all the others where over priced, espeically with the refills. We liked how with the this diaper pail you could just use regular trash bags. It worked very well and we where very happy with our purchase until it started to get warmer out, and our son started to eat foods. It smells! We keep it in our son's closet with an air freshiner in it! It's good while they are young, right now i think any trash can would do the same.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have to agree with the other moms. At first the Diaper Champ was a champ, until I had to change the bag.  It is difficult to open, not to mention everytime I did change the bag my nails would break (and I don't have long ones).  My daughter is 19 months, still breast feeding and eating solids and let me tell you, her pooh stinks.  Once I decided to take the Diaper Champ out of the room and walk each diaper to the outside dumpster, it still took weeks for the smell to get out of the room.  It penetrated into the room.  Not to mention, one day, little tiny flies started growing inside.  I was changing the bag on an every day basis.  This is by far the worst product out there.  Take my word for it when I say, I rather take the walk and dump the diaper outside than have to use the Diaper Champ ever again.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I wanted a diaper pail that didn't stink. I'd heard from *everyone* I knew that had purchased a Diaper Genie to not bother looking, nothing out there stopped the stink. ""Just take it outside right away"" was the only solution anyone could offer.Stubborn me, I kept looking - and I am SO GLAD I did! I found this Diaper Champ - no refills - a definite plus - you just use your regular kitchen garbage bags. Convenient, and less costly!But the big question is - did it work? Did it keep the stink out of my baby's room?? I purchased it before my son was born, and now, with my 11 month old baby boy, who went from breast fed to formula to solids, I can happily answer: YES! It works!Now, if you hover right above the opening and inhale deeply, you will catch a whiff of poo. But who does that?? Sceptical friends who had owned the Diaper Genie (the ones who swore nothing would work!) were thrilled and a little jealous that this thing works so well!I've never had an issue with ""skid marks"" as another reviewer posted - 11 months, skid free so far. I have had a seal loosen, as another reviewer mentioned, but as he said - it has not affected the odor prevention of this.Word of warning - it works so well that you will not be prepared for the odor you will get when you open this to change the bag. Hold your breath!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,This is the best thing ever. Easy to use and no need to buy expensive refills. I bought cheap trash bags and only have to replace it every 3-4 days. I also bought a stick up and placed inside so when I changed the bag the smell wasn't so bad. This is definately a product I would tell everyone to buy.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I am one of those super-critical shoppers who researches everything about a product and then second-guesses purchase decisions...but I love this diaper pail.  I was completely satisfied with my purchase and even bought a second one for our upstairs bedroom.*It really is cost effective.  You don't have to spend money on refill bags.  I just use the pastic ones from the grocery store.  They work perfectly.*It is so easy to use, so easy to change.  I tried another brand of diaper pail and you had to push a button and flip a lid and push the diaper through...no.  You should spend zero time disposing of diapers and all your time with your new baby.  The Diaper Champ is effortless.*It effectively keeps the room from smelling like dirty diapers.  I live where it is hot and humid and don't have central air so smell containment is important.  It's not perfect but if you regularly empty the pail it works well.  Scented bags makes the whole room smell kind of nice if you have a super-sensitive nose.*At first I was turned off by the look of the diaper pail, but I have come to appreciate its design.  I bought and tried out a different one and found that the Diaper Champ is taller (about 27"" high) and narrower.  This means that it takes up less floor space but still holds quite a few diapers (I empty it every 2-3 days).  Also I don't have to bend down as much to use it, which really makes a difference when you use it 20 times a day.*A small but considerate detail--there is a foot around the bottom of the pail that you can hold down while you change the bag.  This along with the way the weight is centered in the design makes it so the whole thing doesn't fall over when you open it to change the bag.  The other brand I had tried kept falling over when I tried to change the bag and it was incredibly frustrating.*The only thing against the product I would mention is the noise.  It makes a ""thunk"" when you dispose a diaper into the pail.  I don't mind it during the day--it's actually kind of fun to use.  But during night-time changings you have to flip the handle a little slower so it doesn't make a noise.Anyways, I hope this helps.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love this thing! I don't notice any smell while top shut. It is simple to use, simple to clean. The top does jam when the bag is full, but what else would you expect. I like that because then I know its time to change the bag.I don't know what I would do without this thing!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have had the Diaper Champ in my son's room for 6 months and all of a sudden the room smells like dirty diapers all the time.  The smell is starting to linger down the hall.  I cleaned the diaper champ, let it air out over night and then sprayed it with lysol and it is still stinking up the room!",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We have been using a d. champ for nearly four years now - it has been very convenient, easy to use, and as close to odorless as one could reasonably hope.  We bought it for our son, and when his little sister was born, we bought a different one because the store we were in didn't have a champ.  When my son learned to use the toilet, we got rid of the new one and moved the champ into my daughter's room.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We heard bad stories about the diaper genie and decided to go on a recommendation for the ""Champ.""  Boy, are we glad we listened. I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.  Definitely worth the investment and very easy to use - especially in the middle of the night.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love this product. It is so easy to use and there are no refills. I can use any kind of kitchen bag. There is a smell of course when you change the bag, but it is no big deal, it is just until you tie up the bag.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My daughter is about to turn 2 and I am starting to potty train her, so it is time to sell my Diaper Champ at our next yard sale.  I am reading the mixed reviews on this product and wanted to give my two cents...No, this product does not totally lock in the smell of dirty diapers.  After they start to pile up in there, you do start to get an odor.  Do not buy this if you are looking to avoid diaper smell--you will probably be disappointed, especially since this product costs about $30.  What I'm currently doing is what other reviewers have said--I just put the dirty diapers in with the kitchen garbage since that gets taken out frequently.  (No, my kitchen garbage is not actually in the kitchen, it's on the other side of a safety gate in the adjoining laundry room.  Those of you with toddlers understand I'm sure.)You know what IS nice about this diaper pail though?  It keeps your kid out of the dirty diapers. When my daughter started getting into everything, at least I didn't have to worry about her getting into the nasty diapers and doing anything with them.I don't think this product is worth $30.  It's essentially a plastic garbage can with a nifty lid.  It should probably cost half what it does.  If you get this, try using the plastic grocery store bags and taking them out more often.I want to add one last thing for those parents that don't know--a lot of parents aren't emptying poo from diapers into the toilet before throwing away the disposable diaper.  This is something you are supposed to do, not just for cloth diapers.  That stuff needs to go through the sewage system, not be locked up underground in a diaper that will take forever to biodegrade. I realize this takes some of the convenience out of it being a disposable diaper, but it is something we all need to be doing.  It'll also help cut down on the diaper stink of course.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This thing doesn't work very well. It still smells up the room. I've found the only way to not have smelly diapers around is to throw them in a grocery bag, tie it up and put it outside. It's cheaper too.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We have used our diaper champ for the last 7 months and it is great. It doesn't stink, it is easy to change bags, and you can use any bags you like.  I use our standard kitchen garbage bags.  I have tried the diaper genie and hated it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This product is nice in theory but not all that its cracked up to be.  The foam lining comes out after several months of use (this happened to 3 other people I know too), and it does nothing to stop odor.  (If you peek around the latch, you can see that there is open circulation into the diaper bag where odors flow freely).  Save your money and buy something else - this champs a chump.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Got this for my baby shower, after reading all the reviews.  I have never had a problem with mine.  I uses odor controlling garbage bags, and you never smell any dirty diapers.This product is great!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,It does contain most of the odors but not all.  It is however a huge hassle to open so beware if you value your manicures.  It will save you money on refills so that's a plus.,3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My baby is now 8 months and the can has been helpful.  I think it's great to make sure the really smelly ones are sealed, especially if I can't run to dump the trash outside.  I do usually bag the really bad ones, so I don't dirty the the entry.  It's also great now that the baby is crawling.  She can easily knock over a trash can, but the Diaper Champ is much heavier and she hasn't been able to get into it.  I doubt she will be able to get into it even when she is older.The bags are easily replaceable and affordable, far more than other options.  My friends recommended against the other options, which they claimed they worked for awhile, but soon became cost ineffective and smelled.  My friends liked my choice.You do have to empty the Diaper Champ can and clean it, but since it holds some pretty toxic trash, I would recommend that with any disposal system.  I'm extremely satisfied.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Have had no problems with this! We use regular scented trash bags & empty out twice a week. No issues with smells, but we keep it in the bathroom and use scented trash bags so that may help. We used the diaper genie with our first baby & this one is considerably much better. Good price too!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Over the past several years, I have babysat for many different families.  In every home where there was a child in diapers, there was a Diaper Genie.  Recently, I had my first child, and I decided to try the Diaper Champ instead.  I am so glad that I did. I find it much simpler to use than the genie, and I have had no problems with odors.(I don't think this should be an issue if the bag is replaced every few days.)  It is also nice being able to use any garbage bag instead of having to purchase special bags.  I have no complaints about this product- it works great for me!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love the Diaper Champ and I plan to get another one!  I have one in the baby's room and I'd like another one for downstairs next to her pack 'n play (since it has a changing table on it).  I feel like it keeps odors in as long as you do what other people suggested such as every time you take out a bag, spray and air out for a couple minutes and then replace with a new bag.  Also, I always make sure that I roll up each diaper securely before putting it in the diaper champ.  We only have to empty ours about every 2 weeks right now (our baby is 11 weeks old) because I change her downstairs half of the time.I really like the fact that you can use your own trash bags.  What a cost saver.  No special bags, no twisting (like the diaper genie), no tying special knots in the bags, no buying refills... as you can see I don't like the genie one bit.  As a babysitter for someone who had the genie - I could never figure the darn thing out.  Think of someone who comes to watch your baby - the diaper champ is so easy and they'll almost never have to change the bag for you.  That diaper genie was always full when I was babysitting.  Ugh!The only reason I gave this four instead of five stars, was because you can easily break your nails trying to open it up to replace the bag (the first time I did, despite the warnings!).  And the lid doesn't stay open for you to air it out unless you prop it open... but that's only for a few mintues anyways.  I do like that a toddler would not be able to open this up or get his/her hands inside of it.  Speaking of hands, you only need one hand to throw away that messy diaper too!I highly recommend the diaper champ - in fact, I'm buying another one today!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love the convenience of not having to worry about special bags, that's why I rated this so high. However, when I first started using this diaper pail, the velcro from my daughter's diapers was getting stuck on something inside the lid.  Needless to say, getting the diapers unstuck was disgusting.  Once I yanked out the fabric that the diapers were getting stuck on, I really liked the diaper pail.  The dirty diapers still stink, so I put each dirty diaper in its own sack and throw them out in the kitchen garbage so that they go out every night.  Now my house never stinks like a dirty diaper.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We love this diaper pail.  I purchased 2 different pails (the other being a lousy product from Fisher Price), one for cloth and one for disposable diapers.  The Diaper champ is easy to use single-handed, and is tall enough so you don't have to bend over much to use it.  We found it contains even the stinkiest diapers well, and can fit quite a few in there.  By trash day the pail is full, easily indicated by having to push the plunger down manually because the other dirty diapers are close to the top.  The plunger can make a loud 'thud' if you turn the handle quickly so at night I just leave the diaper sitting on top until baby is awake, or turn it really slowly.  It doesn't seem to bother the baby, but I don't want to take any chances!  The other pail we use is very inferior.  It takes 2 hands to operate, is very short and doesn't contain the smell well.  We would buy the diaper champ for any of our friends having babies.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I got one of these and a diaper genie for gifts. I decided to try them both out and see which I liked better. The diaper champ defintly won! I love not having to buy refills, my regular trash bags work just fine. It completly hides odors and is very easy to clean and use. It also holds more then the genie.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,This is one great diaper pail.  I cannot smell any diapers in my son's room.  It's easy to use.  Cheap to keep in trash bags.  And holds a week's worth of diapers.  Trash day we just empty it and out to the trash it goes.  Yeah for the Diaper Champ!!!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,This is a great for dirty Diapers. I have had no problem with smells. And it is easy to empty out. I love It!!!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"If you wrap up the diaper with the tape, it keeps the smell out just fine.  Also, because you can use any bags with the Champ, we used some cheap eucalyptus smelling bags and it's a lot cheaper than using the Diaper Genie bags!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I was a diaper genie user until my son was about 1 month old.  I thought that it was hard to use.  We had a friend tell us about the Diaper CHAMP and told us to try it out.  The name say's it all.  Our son is now almost 2 years old.  We just quit using the diaper champ about 3 months ago just because it was just as easy to carry them out to the trash.  We have had no problems at with the diaper champ at all.  It does a great job on keeping the odor in the pail.  Sure, it smells when you change the bag, but you just seal off the bag, and smell is gone.  NO refills to buy or anything.  ITs great.  ITs a breeze to clean and empty the bag.  This is way better than the diaper genie!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have been using this diaper pail for 41/2 months now and just love it. It is taller than other diaper pails so you don't have to bend so far down to dispose of the diaper AND you can use regular kitchen garbage bags.  I didn't want to have to buy special bags which are more expensive and just one more thing you can run out of.  My son is still exclusively breastfed, so I don't know if the Diaper Champ will continue doing such a great job once he is on solids, but so far, it has been great; even in the VERY hot weather it has contained all diaper odors!  I am very happy with it and would gladly recommend it, especially if you are the least bit tall.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,......all I can say is the smell is horrible.....1 star..... Please don't buy this one!,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We like our diaper champ because you don't have to buy special bags and it let's you know when it's full.  We don't have any smell in our babies room, and she poops a lot.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is a great diaper pail, easy to use and keeps the odor in. It is much more cost effective then the genie b/c you don't need to keep buying the expensive bag inserts, just use any old trash bag.There is also no messing with loading a newbag like the genie. It is also very user friendly in that you only need one hand, just drop in the diaper flip the handle over and you're done.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I paid $39.99 for this on Amazon and could have bought it in the store for $29.99.  WAY too overpriced!  I wish I had researched a little more.,2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Daiper Champ is a true champion. Earlier i was planning to buy Diaper Genie as i had liked its innovative style. However, all my friends were sick and tired of its refill system. Not only that, it also gives out a stinky smell when the baby grows and starts eating solid food. It also need some assembly while as CHAMP is so easy to use and can take any size diaper, any trash bag and even a kid can handle it with ease.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is the best diaper pail.  I was a little skeptical because of its simple design, but it really is so easy to use and I haven't noticed any odors since we've been using it.  I highly recommend this product to everyone!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I LOVE this diaper pail!  Just buy regular kitchen trash bags! I haven't found a pail yet that's completely odorless, but this one is the best!  And my daughter can't get into it and pull the diapers out!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ is excellent.  I have experienced no issues with odor, in fact I keep this in my baby's closet.  No special bags are needed ... what a savings!  Just a spray of Lysol in between bag changes and everything smells rosy!  Great value for an excellent product.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I'm not sure about this one.  In concept, it's a fabulous idea.  I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.  I just go to [the store] and purchase tall kitchen bags and use those for the Diaper Champ.  The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.  In addition, I don't believe that it is odorless.  My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor...I'm concerned that as she gets older the #2 diapers will only get worse.  If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We like this diaper pail.  I've had two others with our older kids--one a diaper genie (which I personally found to be a pain) and another by fisher price that I don't know if they still  make.We used this for all diapers for the first six months, until our baby started having solid food.  As an exclusively breast fed baby, there were no odors escaping at all.  (Formula fed babies have stinkier diapers, so I don't personally know if it would be as efficient for them.)  My older two actually enjoyed putting the diaper in.  It's easy to change out.  I always opened it up outside (if you try to open it inside there will be some odors escape), pulled out the full bag, sprayed the can with lysol, and kept a dryer sheet in the bottom which I changed every month or so.Now that little one is having solids, I personally don't expect any diaper pail to contain the smell, so I put dirty ones directly outside.  We still use it for the wet ones.  It has worked out fine because at this point he only has one messy diaper a day.I had a little trouble with the adhesive on the gasket thingee coming loose, but I emailed them and they very promptly sent me a new one for free, along with a few extras in case it happened again (which it hasn't), so I think the customer service is good.The only thing I don't like about it is that you have to empty it fairly often, but I also recognize that honestly that's ridiculous on my part.  The more it holds, the more room it takes up, the heavier it gets, etc.  And the fact that you can't go more than two or three days (as a newborn, anyway) is probably one of the reasons it contains the smell.  The longer they sit, the more rank they get.  Now that he's older and doesn't go through 15 diapers a day, I only change it about once a week.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I bought the Diaper Champ because it was recommended to us over the Diaper Genie.  2 weeks after using it we decided it wasn't for us.  It didn't hold the smells in AT ALL! Tried using scented garbage bags and that didn't help! Our room still stunk! I bought the Diaper Genie and while it does't keep the smells in 100% (you can still smell it when you open it to put another diaper in) and you have to buy the refill bags, it works a lot better than the Diaper Champ and the room smells a lot better than it did before.",1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ was recommended to us in the Babies R Us asile by a nanny who was picking up one for one of the households that she was working with.  She loved her previous experience with the product, and we are glad that she spoke up to recommend it to us.Pluses: It is a LOT easier to use than the Diaper Genie (for example you can throw a diaper away with just one hand!  Woo-hoo!)  Also, you can use regular kitchen trash bags inside it, so you don't have to buy special bags at an inflated price.  Further, due to it's extra large containment area you don't have to take out the trash as often as you would have to with the smaller Diaper Genie and the smell seems to stay inside just fine. :)The one minus that I experienced: According to the directions that came in the box, you can take apart the drum/piston assembly if you should wish to thoroughly clean the inside of it.  When we first bought the Diaper Genie I tried to take it apart.  I *could not* get it to come apart, nor could my husband.  It would not BUDGE-so much so that if the directions didn't specifically mention that it could be separated I would have assumed that it was not built to come apart.  After trying to get it apart for a ridiculous amount of time, (using practically everything from my nails to a crowbar,) I finally broke down and called the customer service number to see if I was missing some key- a button or lever to push- anything!  The customer service person told me to ""try harder"", then call again if I couldn't get it open!(Insert long pause with upraised eyebrows here.)Needless to say, I thought that was a bit less than helpful.  So... maybe my Diaper Genie was warped, or maybe they are all impossible to get open- it's your gamble.  I didn't take it back to the store because I assume that they are all that way.  On the bright side, I really haven't felt that it's gotten dirtier than a lysol wipe could handle- so despite that lack of helpfulness that the customer service folks could offer me, I would still recommend the product itself to a friend.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband and I went to Babies R Us to buy a diaper genie, but instead were intrigued by the diaper champ... the store was sold out, the worker said we should have them hold one for us because they sell out as soon as they get them on the shelves... I can see why!  I have already referred about 5 of my friends to buying one.  We live in a small house, and if something stinks in one room, it will stink up the entire house, so we are so glad to have something that really works for those dirty diapers!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Well, the first three months were odor free!!  Then after the charcoal chamber absorbed all the odor - watch out.  After the3rd month, it was intolerable!!  I am going out tomorrow to purchase the diaper genie or something better!!!  No matter how much you clean or how often you spray with Lysol the smell keepscoming back.  And they don't have a website to complain too!",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I am the mother of 9 children and this is the easiest diaper pail I have ever used.  It captures odors and it uses regular trash can liners so I don't have to buy any custom can liners, which saves me money and time.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My friends think I am strange, but I have to show my Diaper Champ off to anyone that comes in my house:) I recieved a diaper genie as a gift when I had my daughter three years ago and hated it. When I got pregnant this time, I decided to try something different. The Diaper Champ works great and I am saving tons of money not having to buy special bags. My 3 year old loves to turn the handle for me after I change the infant - some of my adult friends can't even figure out how to turn the Diaper Genie!!!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Unlike others, the Diaper Champ uses standard trashbags -- saving you headaches from trying to find the right bag and money because you don't have to buy a bag that only works in the Champ.  The Champ uses a wonderfully simple design to keep out odors and won't break.  The best part is that it is a full-sized can, which means you have to empty it less often.  The one drawback about not smelling dirty diapers is when you go to empty the Champ -- take it outside before you open it!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Love the Diaper Champ.  I had planned to get the Diaper Genie, but after I read the reviews, the Diaper Champ won out!  I love the fact that the Diaper Champ accepts any kind of bag, and you don't have to purchase specific bags.  That's way too much of a headache and expense that I don't need.  It's also super easy to use one-handed which is important with a squirmy infant either in your arms or on the changing table.  It took me a few minutes to learn how to change the bag, but that, too, is easy once you figure it out.  We haven't had a problem at all with the smell, but we do wipe it out with Clorox wipes every so often just to make sure.  This is one of those baby items I wouldn't want to do without.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The diaper wipes get stuck in the mechanism, making it unable to properly flip over. (edited, one year later to report:)I recently stopped using this item because the baby's room started to smell like urine, etc, after a few days. It didnt block the smell of the diapers. I am not sure diaper pails can really DO such a thing, but if they can, then this product isnt doing it's job. I started putting each diaper in a ziploc bag before throwing it away in this Diaper Champ, hoping that it would take away the stench of old diapers...no such luck. Now I just take the diaper with me and throw it away outside or in the main kitchen trash that gets taken out each night. I would take away my three stars and give two or onw, but I can't change what I put originally.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"A great product that works as promised.  I haven't had any problems with it accumulating odor, but I have a friend who did. I went to look at his and picked it up, it felt like it weighed 50 pounds! Folks, ya gotta empty it every few days, it can do only so much. The only con against it vs. the genie is that you should wrap the diaper tightly or the delivery chute will get soiled.  Other than that, it blows the genie away.  BUY IT.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We are using the Diaper Champ with our first baby and we love it!!  We don't have a problem with odors because we keep a roll of diaper disposer bags (little roll of blue plastic bags with a yellow duck dispenser) nearby in the changing table to put the smelly diapers in - this keeps everything clean and the blue bags are extremely economical to purchase (maybe $3 for 50 bags).  A small price to pay for an almost odorless diaper pail - we only use them for poopy diapers, not for wet-only diapers so they last for quite a while.  The bag in the Diaper Champ still gets changed 1 - 2 times per week because it's full, not because it's smelly.  This method also keeps the chamber and plunger free of messes.  Since the Diaper Champ can be used with any garbage bag, it's one less thing to have to remember when shopping and changing the bag is so simple and quick, it's easier than changing our kitchen garbage bag.  We have relatives who are expecting babies and will be sure to encourage them to register for the Diaper Champ.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ not only holds bombs, it is the bomb.  We used it for out first child 3 years ago, and are now using it for our new twins.  Holds in the odors so well, that even grandma occasionally makes a deposit herself!",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have been using the Diaper Champ for the past three months. It holds lots of diapers and you can stuff it full. I have not smelled any bad odor coming from the pail in my son's room. It is easy to change a new bag, but I would suggest doing it outside. Once you open it up the smell does escape quickly. But, just give a quick wipe with a disenfectant cloth and put in your own garbage bag and you are ready to put it back in the room. I am very happy to have this diaper pail. I recommend it.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We love our diaper champ, and are so glad that a friend tipped us off to it. We had the diaper genie on our registry, but someone suggested that we get this instead--because we would save on bags. You can put any small size garbage bag in it- our local Target sells a pack of 90 for 1.99. Plus, from my babysitting days, I remember DiaperGenie being a little hard to use/empty. The diaper champ is easy, just throw the diaper in and flip! If you are trying to choose between the two, I'd go for the Champ.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"THis thing works!  There were 3 baby cousins born 2 weeks apart in our family, I have the Diaper Champ and the other 2 have Diaper Genies -- I am the only one using my diaper pail. They quit using theirs in a few weeks because of the smells.  They both feed formula and only have one poopy diaper a day, so they immediately remove it from the house. My baby is breastfed and has poopy diapers at most diaper changes and this Diaper Champ diaper pail has been up to the task so far, he is 8 weeks old.  Outside is easy to wipe down with clorox disinfectant, since sometimes the cylinder gets a little runny stuff on it if I don't wrap them up tight enough. When it  doesn't want to turn and drop all the way down, then that's when I know it needs changed. It's nice not to have to buy special bags too!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love this product because you can use REGULAR TRASH BAGS and you do not need to order ""refill bags"" to keep this unit operational!  It's easy to use, blocks all odors, and once you pay for the unit, there are no additional bags to buy...which saves you money in the long run!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love this diaper Champ. I got it as a shower gift and hadent heard of it before but when I started using it I had to tell all my friends. This will definatly be my gift of choice from now on to all my pregnant friends. As other reviews say the smell isnt that great when it gets full but its not that bad (I see it as a hint the bag is full and its time to change). I also spray the inside w/ febreeze or lysol disinfectant during each change and that nips the problem in the bud. Overall, Its one of those things that I cant live without but didnt know it until I got it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This was my 3rd diaper pail with my 3rd baby.  This one was by far the best one and the easiest to use. You can use your own bags, which makes it a plus over the Diaper Genie.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I originally bought the Diaper Genie when my son was born. It broke when he turned 9 months so I bought another Diaper Genie. However, the Diaper Genie became very smelly as my son got older and onto solids. I decided to switch to the Champ and I think it's much better at handling odors. It also holds a lot of diapers. Not having to purchase special bags is a plus. Now, I agree with others that there is probably nothing out there that truly gets rid of odors, but I think the Champ does a good job. Just make sure the tape of the diaper is not exposed when you throw your diaper in the Champ and try and empty it as often as possible. My son is now 12 months and after 2 Diaper Genies and a Champ, I highly recommend the Champ.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I had a cheap safety 1st pail and hated it. It fell apart and did not keep down on the stench AT ALL. I read a ton of reviews and thought...&quot;hmm  the diaper dekor sounds the best&quot;. However, I really did not want to deal with buying special bags and all that (plus the pail itself was more expensive). I know I didn't want the genie, so I tried the Champ. Since I have not tried the Dekor, I can not really say which is better. But the Champ is easy to use, inexpensive, and keeps down on the bad odors. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS (especially for people who are not rich and dont want to spend the time and effort finding and buying special bags)",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"my son is now 3 months old and when he was born i didnt have a diaper pail.  well after reading the reviews i decided to go with the diaper champ. let me tell you, the only time it smells is when its full or you open it to change the bag, after that with a fresh bag, there are no disgusting smells. i love this pail and i dont have to worry about forgetting about needing refils and running out at 3 a.m. because i can use my tall kitchen bags! my 3 year old enjoys helping me change the baby because he likes to flip the handle.  this was my best investment for the baby!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,It stinks - we lysol ours 2-3 times a week. Diapers get jammed and it hardly holds any. We are better off buying a flip garbage can lid for like $6 bucks. Same idea without the headache and the ""diaper pail"" look.The only good thing with this one is you can use any garbage bag you want.,1
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We got this for our newborn, and within the first two weeks of use, the liner (that I assume is supposed to keep odor in) fell out because it got caught on one of the stickies on the diaper. This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I recieved this pail as a gift and loved the idea that it didn't require specifc refills packages. You can use any plastic garbage bag! It's easy to use and convienient. One minor detail is you don't know when it's full until you can't turn the handle any  more, but that's a small price to pay for this wonderful product.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,I am glad I bought this! It uses regular garbage bags and there is no odor at all. It is so easy to use. Thumbs up on this one. I am glad I didnt get the diaper genie..it wouldve been a waste of money!I recommend this diaper champ to everyone!,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"Its a good product because its easy to use, and you don't need the expensive refillable bags like the Diaper Genie.  However, it doesn't do so good of a job hiding the smell.  We'd spray the inside with Lysol disenfectant, but if we waited for the bag to fill up to capacity our room would be full of the dirty diaper smell.  So that's the only reason I give it a 4 stars.Its easy to use, and inexpensive when it comes to the refills.  Just doesn't mask the smell of dirty diapers that well.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"this works really well.  I found it easier than diaper gienie and you can drop in the diaper and dispose with one hand.  To keep odor down you need to change before it gets too full, couple times a week  or more often if have a couple poopy diapersYou also can use any bags.  I have one on each floor of my home.Also keeps the dogs from getting the diapers.  occasionally a diaper will get stuck but that is usually when it is getting too full.  Only prob I have found is when I push on the lever to open to change the bag it is kind of difficult to unlatch and have broken a nail on it a few times- no biggie, kind of annoying.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This truly is the champ of diapers. This product, unlike the genie and others, is standalone of ""refills"" (well, you do need garbage bags, but you should already have those). It also does a very good job of keeping the stink away. Not once has the smell came out in such a way that we notice.It also kind of reminds me of the ghost jail thing in Ghostbusters, you know, where they put the trap in and release the ghosts?It's a great product. It's kind of big, it's well made, and it will not need to be changed out for about a week. I'd advise anyone to buy it.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I've read all of the reviews of those of you who can't understand why the rest of us hated our Diaper Champs, and I just have to say-give it a while, you'll find out. We bought our Diaper Champ when our first son was born. For pretty much  the first year we LOVED it. Everyone is right, you don't have to spend money on seperate bags, it's a nice height so you don't have to bend over it and it's really easy to use. I think it takes about a year though, or maybe even a little longer, and it will start to reek so bad that you'll want to sleep at the neighbors house just to escape the smell. For all of you who haven't used yours long enough-just wait, it will happen. We scrubbed ours with bleach, we emptied it daily, we aired it out in the backyard for two days, and then we finally started putting every single diaper in ziplock bags before putting them in the diaper champ (so much for no extra bags!). NOTHING helped. I'm not stupid, I understand that when it comes to diapers, nothing is smell proof. We emptied it all the time and disinfected it constantly. But I'm not talking normal stinky diaper smell. I'm talking the combined smell of every stinky diaper in the entire world. It was SO BAD. Unless you plan on potty training your child when he turns one, and good luck with that, you'll probably end up replacing yours before the diaper days are over. In the end we bought a Diaper Genie. We've used it for two years now and have had no problems. It kinda stinks a little when you open it, but the smell stays in there when it's closed. I'll buy seperate bags any day if I never have to smell that foul Diaper Champ again.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I see that there are complaints of stinkiness regarding this unit, but short of hermetic sealing, you're gonna be dealing with poo smell. I think a bit of odor is a fair trade-off for the ability to use normal trash bags and not be locked into yet another system of expendables. (See Braun shaver cleaning cartridges, etc.) The unit relies on a fairly tight seal between the bag (where it passes through the dark blue plastic holder) and the ""funnel"" bottom on the underside of the top portion. If the bag installation is somewhat off this would probably lead to a poor to non-existent seal.That said, the design of the unit is pretty clever - the piston and gravity work to deposit the diaper into the bag in one fell swoop as the handle is rotated through a 180-degree arc, without any hazardous poking of fingers in the vicinity of fresh poo.  That the lid latch is not immediately easy to pop open can be seen as a feature - keeping the contents safe from rude dogs who knock over trash for the goodies inside.  All told it seems to work very well.",5
Basic Comfort Rest EZ II Pregnancy Wedge,"I bought this pillow a month ago, and have been sleeping great ever since! I am 5 months pregnant, and had been sleeping with a regular pillow under my belly until i purchased this product. I am petite so i was always having to lift my belly to set it on the regular pillow, and i could feel my round ligaments cramping up. I haven't woken up with discomfort or pain since using this pillow! It keeps me from rolling on my back and is very comfortable to sleep on. I don't have any complaints with this product. However, i can see how it could be a problem for someone who tosses and turns at night, or for someone on the larger side, it may have enough back support.",5
Basic Comfort Rest EZ II Pregnancy Wedge,"I love this pillow. I just bought it &amp; am finding that it keeps me on my side where I belong. Being a back sleeper is tough when you aren't able to do so. I only gave four stars because I still have lots of back pain, but hopefully I will lose it with more pillow use. I wish I'd bought it LONG ago!",4
Basic Comfort Rest EZ II Pregnancy Wedge,"Although I'm not extremely big yet, I wanted to try to get a pillow so I could get used to sleeping on my side (I'm normally a back sleeper).I'm in my 4th month and just bought this pillow. The first couple nights, I tried it as the picture suggested.  But I found that it wasn't staying the way it was supposed to, and it just wasn't comfortable.Then, a couple of nights ago, I just took the larger of the two wedges, and put that behind my back as I laid on my side.  I made sure my shoulder was comfortable, by adding an extra pillow under my head.  And ever since I tried this configuration, I have been sleeping much better. I think this is working for me, because since I am a back sleeper normally, this kind of feels similar to what I'm used to, with the wedge on my back.Also, the past month or so, I've been waking up with pretty bad lower back pain, but ever since I started using the wedge behind my back, I have had almost no back pain.I would recommend this to anyone who is having trouble sleeping on their side and/or is waking up with back pain.",4
Basic Comfort Rest EZ II Pregnancy Wedge,"This pillow helps to support the growing belly, but I really bought it for my aching back.  The back support is minimal at best - it doesn't stop me from rolling over to my back nor provide a cushion of support to lean my back up against when I am tired of putting my full weight on my left side.  I have had this product for about 2-3 months, and now use it only about 1-2 nights per week.  But for the price, it is better then nothing.",3
Basic Comfort Rest EZ II Pregnancy Wedge,"By the time I actually purchased this, around my eighth month, I was already used to sleeping on my side.  The problems I was having of basic discomfort and pain when sleeping were not helped by this product.  If I wanted to move at all I had to wrestle with it to move it and I still hurt all the time.  I guess by that point nothing would have helped.  It might be useful if you buy it very early on, though.",2
Basic Comfort Rest EZ II Pregnancy Wedge,I felt a complete difference the very first night I slept with the pregnancy wedge.  I regret not purchasing this sooner.  It truly makes a difference in our sleep - and we diffently need our sleep!  After the baby comes you can use it to prop the baby's head/body up when he/she is ill - another wonderful use.  This is a must buy and a great deal.,5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","My son is 18 months old, and I have been using this sheet for over a year (I now have 2 of them). This is a wonderful item for parents who don't have the patience for constantly changing a fitted crib sheet when baby's diaper leaks (and we all know this happens no matter what we do). I have read the warnings about babies getting stuck under the sheet, and while I agree that this is very dangerous, I have never had a problem with mine. I did have to exchange a sheet recently, however, because the elastic pieces and the snaps were sewn too close together, which made the sheet bunch up in several places &amp; not lay flat in the crib. I noticed that many of the sheets are sewn this way. Other than that, I highly recommend this crib sheet.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",We got 2 of these sheets as a gift and I feel sorry for the person who bought them. They don't stand up to any kind of washing and they're still dangerous. My wife and I finally gave up and made our own sheets that are much much safer. They're like larger pillow cases that fit over the entire mattress. Little more trouble to put on but our son can't get wrapped up in them no matter what.,1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I had high hopes for this product, anything to make our lives easier, especially for crib changes in the middle of the night.  However, I had to return this product for multiple reasons.  First, it does not attach properly to my crib.  I have a standard size crib, which a standard mattress fits in just fine (very snug) however the elastic loops do not attach to my crib rails correctly, so there are either loose elastic pieces that the baby could find and chew on, or it's stretch funny across the crib leaving lumps of fabric in the way, either way it's not appropriate.  Second, it's extremely hot. If you have a warm body baby, (s)he will be sweating in minutes laying on this thing.  Our little boy would be on it for less than five minutes then be screaming because he was so hot.  We have central air in the house, so it wasn't because the house in general was too hot. We had trouble moving him from his pack n play to his crib for weeks, until we realized that this layer could be the issue.  As soon as we removed it, he was perfectly content to sleep in his crib.",1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","Love this. We keep several layers on the crib mattress: mattress pad/protector, sheet, then ultimate crib sheet. In case of nighttime accidents or illness of any sort, I can just pull the ultimate crib sheet off, have another sheet ready to go, and mattress is always protected. Deducted one star b/c both of our ultimate crib sheets balled up immediately with first wash. Not as bad with second sheet since actually followed washing directions, but still had some pilling of soft layers.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","It's kind of weird to be putting a cover over your crib sheet (and never having to change the crib sheet), but these were a lifesaver after my daughter started leaking poop like crazy overnight.  Changing the crib sheet daily was NOT fun.After I got this, it got a bit easier.  It's not super fast to unsnap and snap on, but better than replacing the crib sheet (esp given I have a mobile that gets in the way of taking the mattress out).I have 3 of these so I don't have to immediately wash the dirty one.Only con is that the material seems a little rough.  Not as soft as the crib sheet fabric, unfortunately.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I purchased two of these sheets for myself before our baby was born, and also one for a friend's baby after I had tried them for myself. These sheets are great. I first used it on my bed before baby was born just in case my water broke while I was in bed...which did happen! And the sheets protected my mattress and bedding beautifully. The same in my baby's crib. I also use the sheets on the floor when baby plays on the floor (on top of a softer blanket). The ultimate crib sheet is basically a soft sheet on one side, a rubbery backing with something soft in between the two. All the bedding you'd probably put on the crib mattress but all sew together as one unit. Washes easily. I'd get two, one for the wash, one for the crib. I use one brightly colored fitted sheet on the crib mattress under the ultimate crib sheet just to give a little bit of a decorative look to the crib since the ultimate crib sheets I have are plain white. I recommend this product and will be using again myself in the future.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I have been using these sheets for 6 months.  I have two Ultimate Crib Sheets, and when my 6 month old has diaper leaks or blowouts while sleeping, I can easily switch to the new ultimate sheet.  They are machine washable and dryer safe, which I LOVE, considering I am doing baby laundry multiple times a week.  Putting regular sheets on crib mattresses is a huge hassle, so the Ultimate Crib Sheet is a huge help for middle of the night diaper leaks.  It takes me much less time to switch these out than to change the whole sheet.  I leave baby's cute sheets on the mattress and use this on top.Size: Both of mine shrank a tiny bit in the dryer, but it is not a problem at all.  They fit flat on top of a regular crib-size mattress.Material:  The top side is a breathable, soft cotton layer.  The bottom side has a soft, waterproof plastic feel.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","Hi - In concept this is a great idea, but I want to make sure people know about certain limitations.  Because of the placement of the securing straps, this sheet CANNOT be used on convertible cribs with a solid headboard.  You must have slats on all 4 sides of the crib - or be handy with a needle and thread.Just want to make sure people know, as these sheets are expensive and I was very disappointed to learn that I am unable to use them.",3
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","Neat idea.  Although, I thought it was boring, so I wanted to put my sheets over it.  Well, it's not possible with the straps.  So, I have my sheets over it and it's not attached with its straps.  I never thought of leaving the sheets on underneath it to show through the sides until I read a review just now.  Perhaps if this was offered in colors as well as just white, it would be less boring.",3
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I don't know how I would have managed without these! My  twin boys wet through diapers like crazy, and these sheets are a huge time saver... just snap them out, wash & dry and snap them back on. They are really soft too.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","works great to keep the mattress and sheets under dry.  It also is good enough to be used without a cover, my daughter doesnt mind it.  Its practical and good for the money paid, recommended.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","The first night we had our daughter sleep in her crib, we had to change her sheet in the middle of the night.  Needless to say, after my husband wrestled the mattress out of the crib and the sheet off the mattress, he was beside himself!  I ordered 2 of these ultimate crib sheets the next day.  They are a snap (literally) to change, and every nursery needs at least one.  Save yourself the midnight wrestling match with the mattress when you need to change the sheet - and go with the Ultimate!",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I used these with my second child, and plan to purchase some for my next child.  They are so simple to use, and make those inevitable middle of the night changes so easy.  I used mine over the top of the decorative sheet (so the mattress would be covered), and therefore only needed to change the decorative sheet once in a while.  Very handy, since I had to wrestle the mattress out of the crib to get the regular sheet off!  It also snaps securely so the baby cannot pull it off.  I would recommend this product to everyone!",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I purchased the Ultimate Crib Sheet for a baby gift. I'm that crazy about this product. Like all of my favorite baby items (my babies are now almost 10 and almost seven), the crib sheet was a gift from a friend who too, loved it. You put your regular crib sheet down on the bed (the fitted one). This one snaps in over the fitted sheet, around the rungs of the crib. If your child poops/pees/vomits in the middle of the night, all you have to do is unsnap the top sheet (it's got a leak proof backing on it) and then you've already got your regular sheet underneath, ready to go. No fighting with the mattress in the middle of the night. Getting a fitted sheet on the mattress is hard enough during the day; doing it when your child has other issues going on is a nightmare. This really is the ""Ultimate"".",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",I love the Ultimate Crib Sheet - we've been using it since our 22 month old was born.  You don't have to constantly lift up the crib mattress and fight to get sheets on.  It works very well and is a great time saver.,5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","Buy 2 of these, so you can have a clean one ready while you do laundry.Usually, I write Good Things and Bad Things, but I have no complaints - so this time, only Good Things!Good Things:1) Easy to get on and off.2) Soft cotton top over waterproof bottom.3) You can put your 'cute' sheets underneath, and really never have to change them, because they never get dirty. So you only need 1 set of pricey sheets if looks are your concern.4) What else do you need out of a crib sheet? :)",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",This is by far one of the best products that we purchased for our baby!  I would recommend that any new mom buy at least two of these sheets.  They make middle-of-the-night accidents so much easier to deal with!  Simply unsnap to remove the dirty sheet and snap on a clean one.In a market where there are so many useless and difficult products available (and as a first time parent you feel obligated to buy them all!) this is a little ray of sunshine!  Too bad all baby products are not this simple and wonderful for parents to use.,5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I just recommended this item to a relative who is expecting.  In thinking about it, I realized that I have had the same 2 Ultimate Crib Sheets in continuous use with 2 children for over 7 years now!  What a time saving device!  It comes off in seconds--no fumbling around at 2 am trying to change a dirty crib sheet.  Crib mattresses fit very snugly in a crib, so it is very difficult to change them; especially with a bumper on.I also think that this is real safety device.  As your crib sheets are washed and shrink they tend to slip off more easily which we all know is a suffocation hazard for baby.  With this Crib Sheet on top of a regular sheet, you don't have to worry about the fitted sheet slipping off. It has also allowed me to buy only one really EXPENSIVE designer sheet which I use underneath.  It has never had to be washed and looks as beautiful (and expensive!) as the day I bought it!  I wish I had invented this product!!!",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I really wish that I had this when my son was a newborn and all those midnight crib cya gongs could have been avoided. This is a really great and easy to use product. It is definitely one of the first things that I recommend to parents and I'm glad that we will have it around for our second child. Make sure tha you buy a backup one or teo for those late night changings. This came in very handy when our 18 month old went through potty training and just for any other leakages or accidents that kids sometimes have.My only complaint was that when we washed these in the wash, some of the snaps would break off. also, on a side note, as cheap as these are from Amazon, I have also been able to find the same brand at TJMaxx and Marshalls for half the price.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","When my son was a newborn, I was able to fold it in two and placed a blanket on top to make it a little more comfortable because it is kind of scratchy.  Now at four months it is at is full length and I still put a blanket on top of it.  Whenever he gets it wet I just take the blanket and the cover and wash it easily.  I don't have to mess with the fitted sheet and trying to get it off of the mattress which is so hard since they are so tightly fitted against the crib.  This makes life simple and cleaner.  You can use it anywhere.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I really like this sheet!  It keeps the rest of my son's crib sheets dry, so easy to take off and clean. I have two so I just wash one and use the other.  Especially great for those nighttime leaks when you just need to change baby and the sheet and get back to bed!",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I thoroughly enjoy this product. It covers the full top surface of the crib, give or take an inch. My daughter has used 3 of these over the last 3 months. The upper material is soft and smooth with adequate middle absorption so that it catches excess moisture. I used one on her crib on top of a decorative sheet, another doubled over in her playpen under a practical sheet (since the playpen pad can't be easily washed), and a third to replace whichever one she soiled most recently. I have not yet had any problems with her getting underneath it. The snaps work well on small crib rails. They may not fit around larger crib posts. I highly recommend this to any new mother with an appropriate crib. At 3am, I love not having to wrestle with the crib mattress.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",I recently attended a baby shower and gave this as a gift.  The mother had requested a couple of these.  Since then she has given birth and this sheet has been working well for her.  Great idea for a baby shower gift.,5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I absolutely love this sheet! Changing my babies sheet is effortless, thanks to this great invention. Just snap one off and snap another one on- so convenient, especially for those middle of the night changes! A couple of my snaps have fallen off over time, but it's no big deal, and the sheet will still work- I highly recommed this sheet to anyone who has a baby!",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",We got these sheets because they got good reviews but I hated them. They don't wash up well. They bunch all up and fall apart after several washes. The elastic that straps to the slats doesn't hold up well to washing either. They look absolutely awful on the bed because they don't cover the whole mattress. I am tossing them in the garbage!!,1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I've had no problems with the product. No shrinkage, no getting under the sheet, no bunching, etc. I LOVE the UCS and have bought it for MANY of my friends.You gotta have at least 2 though.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I love this crib sheet because of its ease of removal and replacement and its protection against all leaks and blowouts.  A friend had recommended it and Im so glad she did.  From the side you cannot even see it is there because it sits on top of the sheet (it is nice to have the matching sheet for the set to look nice).  When a leak happens, just unsnap, throw in the wash, and replace when dried (or buy two which makes it easier).  That way you are not fighting trying to cover the mattress with a sheet each time, lifting and tucking, etc.  This does make life much easier.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I bought two of these thinking, &quot;What a wonderful timesaver&quot;.  But after they were washed a few times, I started noticing that they had started leaking through and moisture was getting on the crib sheet, which meant I ended up changing the crib sheet anyhow. So I am pretty disappointed in the product; my baby is only 3 months old so these really haven't been used that long.  I followed the washing/drying directions but apparently unless these things are handwashed and line dried (and who has time for that w/ a young baby), the lower layer of vinyl doesn't hold up.Also, on one of them, the snaps that hold the sheet to the crib have never worked right and never stay.  I wished I hadn't wasted the money on these.",1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","The concept of this product is good, but I found the snaps extremely difficult to snap and unsnap (maybe they get easier with a little wear, but I haven't used it enough to see).  Therefore, I found it both quicker and easier just to take the mattress out all together and use fitted sheets (which are also more attractive).  I would only use this product if you have a mattress/crib set that have a fit making it extremely difficult to get the mattress out.  Seems like most crib mattresses slide out pretty easily, making this product pretty unnecessary.",1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I saw the postings on the dangers of this product, but I just love it! We do have one on our crib, but we really only use the crib for playtime. We also keep one on the pack n play's bassinet feature and our cosleeper. They're easy maintenance and comfy! If you provide lots of supervision for your child, I really don't see any danger. I will continue to enjoy their benefits!",5

"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I thought this looked wonderful in the store so I registered for a couple.  Afterwards I attempted to put a cute sheet and mattress pad in the crib... such a chore!  I started using these and haven't had to change the cute sheet since.  It's so easy to just snap on and not fuss with anything else.  It's a soft sheet on top, an absorbent layer in the middle, and a waterproof vinyl back so nothing leaks through.  I've changed it in the middle of the night in a couple minutes tops... it washes up great with my baby's normal laundry too!  I highly recommend these sheets.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I have been using these for my son for ten months. It was a huge pain to change his crib sheet as it fits so tightly on the mattress.  With these, I just unsnap the 8 straps connecting the crib sheet to the crib.  I can take the dirty one off and put a clean one on in two minutes or less.  I have two of these, and I am so grateful that I have them!When washing, be sure to take the two removeable straps (one at the top and one at the bottom) off the sheet, and snap closed the six straps that are sewn to the sheet.  That way the straps will not tear in the wash.  I wash them normally in the washer and dry them in the dryer.  I have had no trouble whatsoever with these sheets.  I plan to buy these for everyone I know for their baby shower gifts.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I love this product!  It's such a pain to change the crib sheet and take off the bumper pads, but with this product you just change this and you're done.  It attaches with snaps so you don't have to worry about SIDS.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","We have used Ultimate Crib sheets since the beginning with our 9 month old twins.  They were a huge time saver and we have recommended them to other parents.  This morning I found one of our girls ""pinned"" under a corner of the sheet nearly suffocating.  She had managed to get her head under the corner and the tension on the snap trapped her head under the sheet facing the rubber bottom.  She is ok, but needless to say we have removed our Ultimate Crib sheets and will not be using them any longer.  Please be careful and don't let this happen to you!!!",1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","We have used several of these with our children in the crib. They are nice because one only has to change the top layer rather than trying to re-make the entire crib in the wee hours of the night after a diaper has &#34;lost containment.&#34; We keep several of them on the crib at once so we can unsnap the one, throw it in the hamper, and go back to bed.Unfortunately, there are some durability issues. The waterproof lining on the underside will not last forever. We always wash it in the machine on the gentle cycle and then hang them to dry (we are afraid of the heat of the dryer destroying the waterproof lining). We still have the compromised sheets as the &#34;emergency layer,&#34; but don't trust they would hold a leak for very long. The plastic snaps on the tie-downs also break off with time, leaving fewer points to hold the sheet down.Even with the durability issues, this is the best product we have found for protecting both the crib mattress and some semblance of sleep for the parents when there is a mess.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I agree with the other mom's this item is so wonderful and very easy to use..But I have to also agree that they are somewhat disposable,when you wash them the snaps fall off.....This is a lot cheaper than what I paid for them, I bought mine at babies r us and spent 20 a piece on them....",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","We originally gave this a negative review but I can positively review it for the specific purpose of using it as a urine-resistant layer UNDER a top sheet.  We have the Clouds and Stars zip-up sheets (which I have loved for years) and use the Ultimate Crib Sheet under the zip-up sheet, so when our child would have an accident we would unzip the zip-up sheet and pull off the top and Ultimate sheets and wash both.  It's protected our mattresses over the years.  I wouldn't use it as a top sheet since it seemed that the sheet could easily be bunched up or pulled off by a strong baby, and I'd be concerned about suffocation hazards if a baby wiggles their way underneath, or a choking hazard (if a baby pulls off one of the two end pieces, which go around the crib bars at either end of the crib, and which could fully snap off).  But for this limited use, we used it happily for years.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I have loved having these crib sheets!  I only have to use one regular sheet, and then this goes over the top.  When it needs to be changed, a few snaps does the trick and off it comes.  Otherwise I'd have to have a mattress pad, a waterproof pad, and a regular sheet, and all three would have to come off for each change.  With the thick mattress on the crib, changing them would be a real chore.  The Ultimate Crib Sheet saves time and money.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","This is truly an ""all-in-one"" crib sheet! It's absorbent, soft, and fairly easy to get on and off. It also covers the entire crib - much better than those itsy-bitsy ""leak guards"" we got that only cover about one square foot!The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that not all the snaps stayed snapped. The elastic-snap thingies (that allow you to secure it to the crib) started to wear out before the crib sheet - one was always coming unsnapped - so I ended up just leaving one unsnapped.All in all, however, this is a great buy. I recommend getting 2 so you always have one handy.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",The reviews that say this product is soft are all pretty old (2002-2004 isn). Recent reviews all agree that the product is not soft. Somewhere down the line they must have tried to save some money and made this product. I wouldn't sleep on this so will not use it for my son's crib. As far as protecting the sheet it probably does what is says...but I'll never know since I'm returning it.,2
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","This product is great in that you do not have to tear apart allbedding/mattress to change the sheet. Makes life easier when you already have too much to do.  The back of the sheets have cracked and started peeling after about 1- 1 1/2 yr of use.My biggest concern, however, is my son was able to pull off the snaps that secure the mattress to the crib. He started this at around 1 1/2yrs. This appears to me to be a huge choking hazard!!",3
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I absolutely love the idea of this crib sheet. After receiving one as a gift I immediately tried putting it in the crib. To my disappointment, the elastics at the corners will not fit around the wide posts of my crib. For those of you that have Italian made cribs (I have a Baby Italia), this sheet may not work for you either. This should come as no suprise since it is also harder to find crib bumpers that fit correctly too. Needless to say, if you have an Italian made crib, keep the packaging and the receipt. You may find that you'll have to try another brand.",3
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",This crib sheet is a must have.  There's no constant changing of the regular crib sheets which are a pain change.  Just pop this one off and throw it in the washing machine.  It's also portable.  You can put it underneath your baby no matter where he is sleeping.  Pregnant?  Worried that your water will break in bed and soak your sheets and mattress?  Just lay the crib sheet on top of or under your fitted sheet and your worries are over.,5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","This product was exactly what I needed. I could not find one locally & my only choice was to drive to another, larger town.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I absolutely love this.If you want something easy, ( what mom doesn't?! ) I suggest getting these.They are waterproof, and so easy to change- I honestly don't know what I would do without them!Just make sure to register for at least 3-- one for in the wash, on for in the crib, and one for when the baby decides to ""dribble "" in the crib!ENJOY!",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I, unfortunately, bought a non-standardized crib (I didn't know it at the time). I couldn't find sheets in the store and could only order them from the manufacturer of the crib (at a decent price). I found these and they're great because I can snap them into place and although the top and bottom of the mattress is exposed, it's no different than if I had shrunk it in the dryer.Speaking of shrinking, they do shrink A LOT, even on low heat. However, the efficience of just having to change this sheet by unsnapping it and putting the spare on saves an unimaginable amount of time and energy. You should at least try one once.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","We bought two of these shortly before our son was born, and I could not be happier.  I purchase them on Amazon because they were cheaper than where we registered (I think they were on sale at the time).  He is now 11 months old and we have been using these ever since he was transitioned to his crib at around 3-4 months old.  They are incredible time savers!  They snap on easily and quickly, they are really easy to take off (just pull it off), wash up wonderfully in the washing machine, can go in dryer no problem, and are actually very soft fabric.  They are waterproof but don't feel rubbery or like plastic on the side the baby sleeps on.  Our son loves them so much, he actually won't sleep in his crib until we have one on.  He has peed, pooped, and vomited on these things and they still look and feel great after over 7 months of use.  We have never had the problem of him getting stuck underneath it.  It stretches tight enough to the slats on his crib that he can't get it off the mattress.  The best part is the same as everyone else said, you don't have to change the cute sheets underneath it, so you don't have to worry about taking off the bumpers, lifting the mattress, etc. for those middle of the night messes.  Just snap off, snap on!  Also, having the Ultimate Crib Sheet be a plain solid color is a really good idea.  My son gets too distracted by the little figures on his regular sheets and spends time trying to pick them off his sheets instead of going to sleep.As everyone else has said, if you are going to get this product, I would definitely buy two so you have an extra that can go on the bed while the other is in the laundry.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I really do like the idea of this crib sheet. The only problem is that I have a very thick convertible crib (crib, toddler, full bed) and the corners are too big for the staps to secure to the snap. For now the sheet is secured to the slat beside the corner leaving about an inch of space not covered by the sheet...no biggy, worth it for the convenience. I plan to eventually replace the elastic closures with longer elastic pieces for a perfect fit.",3
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",Yes i have pretty sheets on the crib......but who wants to wash them every time there is a mess.  Well this is the answer!  So much easier (since they snap around the crib slats) to get on and off!  Waterproof!!  What else should i say!  Perfect gift!!!,5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I measured the crib before purchasing this, but it was not a hood fit for our standard Jenny Lind crib. Some of the elastic snaps could not stretch far enough to snap closed, so they just hung thee. It did not make me feel comfortable to have those straps dangling since they could have been a potential choking hazard.",1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","When I bought these two years ago for my daughter, they were the best sheets!  Thickly padded and washed and dried like a dream.  I still have them and use then regularly.  THEN, when my son came along this year, I got two more.  WHAT JUNK!  They are now less than half as thick and after only one washing the vinyl backing is all wrinkled.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, they won't last a month of washing.",1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","Can't imagine life without this!  It's my favorite thing besides his favorite blankie.  I got two Ultimate Crib Sheets when my son was born.  He's now 18 mths and they are still going strong, although they have started showing some wear underneath.  Mine are a bit short on the ends, but it doesn't bother me or him.  I recently changed the sheet on his bed, but don't think I've done so for about six months.  It doesn't really get dirty unless you have some serious overnight leaking, which we recently have had (obviously time to size up his diapers).  Changing the sheet means taking the bumper most of the way off and the mattress out of the crib.  I certainly don't have time for that on a weekly basis and you won't either.  Make sure and get a couple!!!",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","I have 4 daughters and was greatful for this crib sheet.  I had purchased 1 over the telephone several years ago from an ad.  After I received it, I called and purchased 3 more.  My kids are a little older now and no longer in baby beds, but I still use them when they are sick by placing them under their pillows.  It still saves me from changing sheets all of the time.  I have purchased a sheet for everyone I know having a baby for the past 5 years and they all end up buying more of them. THIS IS THE BEST IDEA FOR A CRIB SHEET THAT WAS EVER INVENTED!!!!!",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",Received this sheet and after I felt the scratchy material I started reading all the reviews on this and realized I made a good decision by sending it back! It sounds like this thing is a death trap! Many moms find their babies underneath the pad suffocating! So glad I sent it back before having to learn the hard way.,1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","My son spit up in his sleep for the first 6 months, so this product was wonderful.  However, by the time that he was 6 months old, all of my ultimate crib sheets had developed holes and cracks in the plastic backs.  The product was such a life saver that I will purchase new ones (maybe a different brand) for future children, but I really expected more than 6 months of use out of these.",2
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",The Ultimate Crib Sheet is the ultimate gift for both baby and mom. No more wrestling with a fitted crib sheet. Just lay the Ultimate Crib Sheet over the pretty fitted sheet that matches the bedding and snap it in place. In less than a minute a new sheet is in place and the crib didn't have to be moved and mom didn't get frustrated trying to keep the sheet around the matress while the bumper pads kept pushing it off. It's perfect for those middle-of-the-night sheet changes and it can even be put on one-handed. A must for all moms!,5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","Our newborn baby boy has been having a ball spraying us every time we change him. Thank goodness we bought these crib sheets! I can't see the sheets underneath really well, since it covers the entire top of it, but it keeps it clean and dry. The top is soft, while the bottom is lined with plastic.",4
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","This sheet is such a smart purchase.  Yes, it may be fun to get all of the adorable printed sheets, but this is so much better.  When you have to change sheets in the middle of the night, it is SO much better to simply unsnap and snap this sheet rather than lifting up the cumbersome mattress to get a regular sheet on it.",5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",I received 2 of these sheets as a gift after my daughter was born.  I already had several sheets and didn't think I would use these...then I tried them.  I can't say enough great things about this product.  It is so easy to change the bedding now.  No more lifting up that huge mattress.  Make sure and have 2 of them-so that you can have one clean at all times.  It takes me less than 3 minutes to change the sheets.,5
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",This item posses a chocking hazzard. I woke up to my 6 month old gagging on the elastic strap that holds the sheet to the crib. While it may seem like a wonderful invention (oh how i miss it!) I don't think it's worth the risk.,1
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;",Seems to fit just fine except that the corner snaps could be longer.  We have a Sorelle Rosa crib with hidden hardware so the snaps must go around the outside of two bars for each corner.  The straps are just not long enough to effectively go around all 4 corners.  No big deal though as we just do two corners and then go around the first set of bars on the far side.  So the sheet is offset by a couple inches but doesn't appear to have enough slack to become a safety issue.  If our baby does start to try to get under the sheet it doesn't seem like a difficult task to just add our our strap extensions.  We'll probably be buying a few more to allow for more time between laundry runs.,4
Basic Comfort Handy's Plus Pad Full,"I purchased 2 of these for use on my son's twin size mattress.  They are wonderful!  They contain everything, wash up beautifully and have drastically decreased the amount of laundry that I have to do.  The full size pads are actually the perfect size for a twin mattress in my opinion.  I was worried that the twin size pads would be too small, and I'm glad I went with the full size.Update 01/31/2009:  We've owned these pads for a little over a year now, and they've been great!  With washing 2-4 times per week, both pads are now starting to leak through to the mattress below because the waterproof shielding is starting to develop little cracks and pinholes here and there, so it's now time to replace them.",5
Basic Comfort Handy's Plus Pad Full,I was looking for a nightime waterproof pad for an elderly person.  After looking through what Amazon offered I choose this one and have been pleased with it.  It does a terrific job in absorbing and keeping the bed dry.  It is also very soft and comfortable.Its not as large as the picture would indicate.  Take the measurements given seriously.This is an excellent value.  Recommended.,5
Basic Comfort Handy's Plus Pad Full,"I bought a full size pad for my son's twin bed, and we are able to use it in other sizes of beds too.  It is not too bulky and it is nice for traveling.  Since my son has not had any accident yet, I don't know how well it absorbs.",3
Basic Comfort Handy's Plus Pad Full,"While my 4 yr old had been potty trained since she was about 2-1/2, she wasn't making it thru the night & so we used Pull Up every night. Shortly after she turned 4 she started waking up with dry pull ups.  We gave it a few weeks to make sure it wasn't a fluke & then invested in *two* of these pads.  The tuck in feature on both sides is great & I find that it does stay in place even after a nights sleep.  She finds it comfortable as she's never complained about it (of course, Princess sheets accomanied this new pad to encourage acceptance and we made a HUGE deal about her giving up Pull Ups & sleeping in regular underwear).  The best part about this design is that if there is an accident, you just whip it off (and any other top sheet that might have gotten wet) and tuck in a dry one.  No changing the fitted sheet in the middle of the night.  For us, if the top sheet or blanket gets wet, I've got a second comforter/blanket in her closet to quickly throw over her. (of course pajama changing can't be avoided) That helps get everyone back to sleep as fast as possible.  I've washed them a number of times & they come out of the dryer in the same shape every time (follow washing instructions). The size is also generous.  I was worried that she might move off the pad during the night, but with proper placement to where she normally sleeps most of the night, we've never had a problem.  It says it absorbs 6 cups; while we haven't tested that, I've never found the pad dripping, so all the urine was securely soaked in.  We haven't found a down side to these pads.  Even the price isn't bad-- I did some price comparison and maybe you'll find them a few bucks less, but not by much.  And, if I may add in a bit of my own potty training 2-cents, my husband wanted her to give up pull ups much earlier, but I was in no mood to change sheets (or these pads) *every* night.  I've read that most toddlers' bladders aren't large enough to make it thru the night anyway, so I was just as happy to let it happen naturally. In that way, everyone was happy (well I was and you know what they say about Mamma being happy-- everyone's happy!)  Thus, I highly recommend this pad to anyone going down the no-more-Pull-Ups Road.  I am sure it would be just as useful for any older child (and parents) dealing with bed-wetting problem.",5
Basic Comfort Handy's Plus Pad Full,I got this for my three-year-old daughter to use at night since she still has night time accidents.  It works fabulous!  Super absorbant.  Makes my life so much easier!  I bought two in the beginning and now I'm buying two more.,5
"Summer Infant, Ultimate Training Pad - Twin Mattress, 38&quot; x 28&quot;",Great Product ... Highly Recommend! No more changing crib and toddler bed sheets in the middle of the night!,5

"Summer Infant, Ultimate Training Pad - Twin Mattress, 38&quot; x 28&quot;","It does the job of protecting the mattress, the flaps for tucking under the bed come out a lot though. Not sure if it's worth the hassle of having them.  My daughter tends to be a wiggle worm though.  I suppose without them the pad might not be remotely in the right spot in the morning though. We bought two for a twin bed since she is all over the bed during the course of an evening and I wanted to make sure we were covered. 1 would work for a toddler/crib sized mattress, if you have a twin you will probably want 2.",4

This pad is a great item, it's soft on the top so my son doesnt mind sleeping on it and it really works keeping the sheets dry. My son sleeps all over the place and it's plenty wide enough to give the coverage we need. And it's never leaked through. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that it's tough to tuck the far side in when you have the bed up against the wall like we do. I'm not sure how they could make this better, but they should work on figuring out a way. ;) I only wish I'd gotten 2!!",4
"Summer Infant, Ultimate Training Pad - Twin Mattress, 38&quot; x 28&quot;",This is my second one and it works like a charm. Just don't put it in the dryer on high setting or the backing will start to come apart and the waterproofness is no longer.,5

He is adorable and fun to have around during the day and besides house training him, he's pretty easy to take care of. I could get him to a puppy pad or outside during the day but at night he would go without waking me up and then go back to sleep since he was so young. I got very tired of cleaning pee off my mattress and constantly washing my blankets but I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a full cover since I sleep on a full size mattress. This small cover was a good price and big enough to cover the area where he always goes. I do wish it was bigger but it works very well. I would definitely recommended it.",4

"Summer Infant, Ultimate Training Pad - Twin Mattress, 38&quot; x 28&quot;",I bought two pads for my toddler and have been using them for a year. They work fine and save her mattress from many bed wets. However the surface area of the pad is not very big and my toddler likes to turn and flip around when sleeping. Hence we put two pads on the bed and that solves the problem. My only complaint is the folding area could be longer. My toddler's mattress was very thick and the pads would shift position as the cloth that is folded underneath the mattress is very little.,4

Basic Comfort EZ Changing Pad,"I put this on my baby registry for my first born. After having her home from the hospital for a month, I became very unhappy with this changing pad. My baby had very loose stools (from a strictly breast milk diet) and she soiled this pad close to every changing. I kept having to wash the cover. My girl friend recommended to me another changing pad on the babiesrus website called the ""Contoured Changing Pad"" that has a permanent plastic cover on it (that allows for a wipe clean surface).  I got one and found it to be worlds better than the E-Z pad. In fact I now have two of them, one for upstairs and one for down.",1
Basic Comfort EZ Changing Pad,"I got this pad as a baby shower gift and I think it is just fine. I've never used the velcro straps to strap down my baby, I think you can do without those. I had a changing table given to me and this just fit right in it perfectly. I also got terry cloth changing pad covers with this gift and they fit nicely. Then I put one of those waterproof flannel pads down underneath the terry cloth cover and a smaller one on top of the cover where the baby's bottom goes. I wash the terry cloth cover once a week and don't need to do much more because if he pees or poops in the middle of a change I've got the waterproof pad on top as a back up and just change that out.As a newborn though, when I would put him on the changing table, his legs and arms would flail out and he felt like he was falling and he'd scream. At my mom's house she has a different changing table that has more of a dip to it where he lays and he never did that there-guess he feels more secure that way and can feel the sides of the pad and table hugging him. That would be the only downfall is that it needs to have more of a dip to it. Other than that, it's a great pad-nice and comfy and I like the cover that comes with it, but I've always got other layers on top so I never really see it.",5

Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"I bought this diaper pail because the store had run out of the Fisher Price pail I had originally intended to buy. Boy was I sorry!! Aside from the fact that the diaper pail fell apart into many little pieces every time I went to change the bag, It did not contain the quite pungent odor that accompanies dirty diapers.While this diaper pail was cheaper than the Diaper Genie, I found it to be a complete waste of my hard earned money, as it doesn't even serve well as a basic trash can.",1
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,this bin is great for cloth diapers. we love ours. keeps odors to a minimum and holds a day or two's worth of diapers-- which is all i need because we wash every other day. Our local Babies R Us sells replacement deodisks (or you can buy them online from cloth diaper vendors) when the one that comes with it loses it's smell so that you can maintain freshness. It's easy to clean and use and pretty inexpensive.,5
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"We bought this pail for our first son.  It was easy to use and easy to load new bags.  It was also great that it just used regular kitchen trash bags.  However, it did not contain the smell of diapers hardly at all.  You could walk into his room and smell the diaper pail.  Would recommend trying a different type.",2
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"I liked the idea of this pail using regular kitchen trash bags, however, it is a pain to change the bag.  Also, it is not odor-less.",1
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"I was using the diaper genie and I wasn't at all impressed. I was at a shop needing to pick up Genie refills and saw this pail on sale for $14. I bought it. From day one I loved it I threw out the genie and I won't go back.It only got 4 stars because you do need to buy fresh disks every so often. They are nice because when you open the pail you smell a fresh clean sent. Also I feel the pail could be taller, when I change the kitchen bag (which is the only time you really smell the foul diapers) my bag was only about 3/4 the way full.But other than that its a great investment, no smelly nursery and no dang refills to buy!",4
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"My husband and I bought this with the hopes that it would keep the odor inside and we could save the money on refills.  Well, it did not control odor.  The plastic disk that is included to neutralize the odor works for about a week.  The odor escaped even when the pail was closed.  You do save money on refills at first.  But when the diapers become stinkier as the baby grows, you have to change the bag more often.  I used A LOT of baking soda and Lysol spray to help control the stink.Also, the button on the top that opens the pail can fail easily, and it is also very easy for a child to get into once they start pulling up on things.I would not recommend this product.",2
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,I babysit 8-12 kids usually a day and 2-4 of them are in diapers and this product is real easy because i can keep it anywhere without it stinking everything up and it is easy to dispose of the bags. It is just like a garbage can you would keep in the kitchen or in a bathroom but it really keeps away the odor and it is great cause it is quick and easy jus tbny hitting the button and closing it. Very simply to do while holding a 4 mth old and a 22 mth old,5

Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,Thanks to this wonderful diaper pail I never have to smell dirty diapers! The other wonderful part is you can use regular trash bags( I buy the drawstring so I never catch a whiff of the contents) instead of pricey refills!! I highly recommend this product!,5
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"It's not worth it!  I have tried Diaper Genie and Safety 1st, now I'll have to try something new.  This diaper pail has broken on me and I've had to have parts replaced.  I had to pay the mailing cost to send the broken part in!!  It was cheap, but not worth the loss of time trying it. It stinks--even with only one smelly diaper in it.",1
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"I've found that the Odor-Less Diaper Pail is nowhere near odorless!!  It was okay when our baby was still making the non-smelly diapers, but FORGET IT once your kid is on solids.  My husband empties that pail every few days (then sprays the inside with Lysol) when it's only filled with pee pee diapers.  And it is ready to be emptied by then, because it reeks of urine.  Don't even think about keeping poopy diapers in there!!  We have to dump poop, from a soiled diaper, in the toilet and just throw away the diaper because the Odor-Less Diaper Pail DOES NOT contain the smell.  Buyer BEWARE!

Also the first time I changed the bag, the springs broke under the top.  I still use it because it's the only thing I have, but I would not reccommend this to anyone.

It's not exactly odor proof, but you won't smell anything unless you leave it for more than two weeks. I keep a spray can of room freshener next to the pail and when I get a stinking diaper, I give the pail lid (the inside blue part) a quick spray and everything is fine.

You will end up spending more money to replace it with a better one.",1
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"I purchased this diaper pail for my son and let me tell you it was more work keeping up this pail then it was caring for a newborn.  We purchased this product because there were no special bags to buy and it had an area to place deoderizer tablets.  Well the spring popped off every time we put a diaper in it which left a space for the smell to come out. It was nasty.  We had to constantly fix the springs just so it was close up each time.  The pail stunk so bad even with the tablets and an air freshener in the bottom of the bucket.  It was so bad, we soaked it and washed it and it still stunk. We ended up throwing it in the dumpster. It was just horrible. Not a good product and poorly made.",2
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,Not being able to find the deodorizer discs refills was my only complaint. I found them. You can order them directly from Safety 1st by calling 1-800-544-1108. They are 50 cents each plus shipping and handling.,4
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"We have this diaper pail, and it seems to work fine for us.  Our son is one year old now, and the pail is working fine.

I registered for another one for baby #2.",4
Cord 'Shortner,"I love these cord shorteners. I have 11 month old twins and have bought several of these to put in the areas they play in. I have also used them in my own bedroom, even though the twins are never in there. One of these wraps my electric toothbrush cord up nice and neat so it isn't taking up all of the sink. It wraps up two thin cords together or 1 thick cord by itself.This product has made having twins a lot easier. It is durable and comes with sticky stuff to adhere it to the wall, although removal of it will mean patching up and repainting. I never stick it to the wall, but it does a great job and hiding all the cords we have around the house. The kids are no longer interested in the plugs when these things are in place. And if I decide I need to move and item, it easily comes apart with a push of the center.",5
Safety 1st Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,"What a pain! My daughter could open them no problem, luckily because it was so easy she wasn't interested in it. You have to take them off to use the broiler. Like another reviewer said, it's easier just to remove your knobs...don't waste your money.",1

Safety 1st Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,"These knobs are fairly easy to remove.  They provide basic protection, but it a toddler is determined he/she can get these off.  It's always a trade-off of convenience vs safety.  We have another set of these that is a pain in the rear to open up but we know that the kids can't do it.",3
Safety 1st Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,"I bought this because everytime I go to my cabinet above the stove, I accidently turn on the stove knobs.  These work!",5
Safety 1st Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,My daughter can no longer get to the stove knobs. Everyone is happy about that! They do exactly what they say they do. Good value.,5
Safety 1st Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,"First off, these may not fit everyone's range. They are designed to fit a wide variety of standard-sized knobs, but may not work for you. Yes, you must remove your knobs to get these covers on initially, but if they fit, they definitely work. Yes, you must open the cover to turn your knob, but remember, these are safety devices, not convenience devices.That said, they worked on my GE Profile range, thankfully. From what I could tell, most of the GE ranges use the same knob types, so if you've got a GE, I believe these covers will fit.I had kept these (and a few other knob covers) on my wish list until my daughter learned how to reach up and turn on the gas. I had been reluctant to order because of all the snarky reviews - there didn't seem to be a highly-rated knob cover. Well, suddenly, I needed something right away! I immediately ordered these ones, which arrived very quickly (thank you Amazon Prime!), and I had them installed in about two minutes. Neither my wife nor I have any difficulty opening or closing these with one hand, and my toddler can no longer turn on the gas.On a negative, my knobs are located directly above the oven door opening, so I must agree with other reviews here that I run the risk of 1) snapping off the caps when I close the oven door, and 2) melting the covers if I leave the oven door open. I do not blame Safety First for this, if you want to consider this a design flaw - I would blame GE for that one! Knowing this has allowed me to preserve them from breaking (thanks to other reviews). I do wish that this was a 6 pack, though, since I have 6 knobs on the range - the main reason this is only a 4 star rating. I have a bottom warming drawer, which is electric and harder to turn on, so I opted to leave that knob exposed, preferring to protect the gas knobs, instead.On the positive, It works. My toddler was constantly turning on the gas, or changing the flame height on the stove while my wife or I were cooking - you know how they love to imitate. We would also occasionally smell gas, and we knew she had tried to do some cooking again. Those brief moments of the unattended wandering child are the biggest reason for these knob covers - scary to think of a gas explosion! :-( After installing these, she still reaches up to the knobs, but now she merely spins these covers, leaving the knobs untouched. And now that we no longer need to chide or punish her for turning knobs (really for just being curious), she has lost a great deal of interest in them altogether. These will stay on the range, however, until they break or are no longer needed.If they break, I will definitely replace with the same ones.",4
Safety 1st Stove Knob Covers 5-Pack,"We thought that these were the same Safety 1st knob covers that we had purchased two years ago. Those were larger, and were very easy to open with one hand, using minimal force. These are much smaller, barely cover our knobs, and are nearly impossible to open with one hand. One of us CANNOT open them without pulling the knob off of the stove, the other needs to stop cooking and concentrate on the proper amount of force to apply in order to open them.Overall, these knob covers are very good at covering knobs, and preventing little fingers from turning them, but they are not very good at letting you use the knob in a manner that will permit cooking.Take a little more time and look for the larger, easier to open Safety 1st knob covers (with a thumb-sized push-pad).",1
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,"The product itself works great, it's just a little hard to use. It's a little difficult to get the sides squeezed to get it open, and if your cord is larger than the standard size it's a little tight. But it keeps the little people out.",4
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,My little guy is very active and loves to get into trouble. We only have a couple items plugged into an outlet that isn't covered by furniture so I purchased these to make sure he couldn't pull the plug out of the wall and get shocked. They are wonderful and I feel much safer letting my little guy explore the house. Even though I am never too far away our let him out of sight he still manages to get into things. He is so fast and just a little distraction could be fatal. But I don't have to worry about the plugs anymore! One less worry and just the little bit of stress relief that makes this purchase very easy for me to recommend it to all parents.,5
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,These are great- easy to install and actually keep prying little fingers out of the sockets!,5
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,"My 1 yr old is very clever, but he can not work out how to open these, they have been a life saver - literally!!!!",4
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,"Would work great for things like lamps, clocks, etc that have thin cables.  But power bar cables are too thick to fit in these.  Bummer.",1
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,"I had to use a chisel to scrape the plastic so that it would fit our standard outlet.If you are willing to chisel some of the plastic, then it will fit.The cable guide at the bottom cannot handle shielded cable from a power strip (some shaving of plastic will solve this also.)The entire box may not cover the outlet completely and leave a gap around the edges where kids can insert things and reach the wires.",3
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,"These outlet covers do just what they are supposed to. I'm not at all concerned about my little ones being able to bust into them...they are hard enough for adults to disconnect! I wasn't sure about the quality of a Safety 1st product (seems to be hit or miss with this company), but I was pleasantly surprised by the integrity of these covers. And the price is great for a 2-pack.",5
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,"I can't believe I'm even saying this, but the plug cover portion of these covers - that is, the part that screws into the wall socket - doesn't fit.  I have regular plug sockets throughout the house, old style with the screw in the middle, and these things won't fit on any plug socket.  The holes are too narrow.....After some frustration and some thought, I realized that these outlet covers are designed to fit over the existing plug cover, not to replace it as most others do.  They are, in fact, not even big enough to enclose the hole in the wall, and once I realized that it all fell into place.In any case, that's the story.  Maybe it'll save someone else the aggravation.Are they any good?  Well, they do what they're supposed to do.  As others have said, very hard to remove, so only use them on sockets that will not have plugs frequently changed.",3
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,"These are fine for standard, thin power cords.  We have had one in place that the kids have never dislodged despite two years of trying.  But they will not close over the heavy, thick cords like those for microwaves, computers, or power bars.  We finally ended up attaching ours to the wall with duct tape to cover those cords.I am giving this three stars because it does work fairly well for thin cords, and because I have yet to see anything better out there.  My advice?  Invest in duct tape.",3
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,A clean and easy install. Very secure. Impossible for children (and hard for adults) to get to your plugs.Will not work with oversized plugs or adapters.,5
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,These things are awful! I can't even get them apart to install them. I even had my husband try and he couldn't get them apart either. I know it's suppose to be baby proof but come on??,1
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,"This would be 5 stars, but the cover is hard to open once the unit is installed. This doesn matter much to me as the two things that are plugged into my outlet are not things I move around...so they are staying in there! Overall, I thought this was easy to install and I feel much better knowing my little monkey can't unplug things and get hurt.",4
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,Almost impossible to open for installation and to use once installed. Good because Im 99.9% sure my little one will never get hurt but my hands hurt now. A few swear words needed to remain mentally sound during install process lol,4
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,I bought this thinking it was a great idea but you can't use it with any plugs that have a larger than standard plugs. I feel everything of my children's has an oversize plug that goes in the wall. Have yet found anything to use it for.,2
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,This thing works but it's very tricky getting off. If you work it a little you figure out how it will just pop off. Don't get discouraged like I did. Work it gently and It will come off easy with a little presure. Does not fit a bulky box plug in head only standard ones like a lamp.,5
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,"Great to keep kids away from plugs, but it prevents me from using the plugs as well. If you have something that is plugged in permanently, it may work great but don't use this for an outlet you need to access regularly.",3
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,"These were a complete hassle to pry apart just to install them.  My mom and I each held a side and pulled, but nothing.  I finally had to shove in the latches as far as I could to get them apart.  Since that seems to be the only way to take the cover off, I had to leave the latches pushed in, defeating the purpose of keeping kids from pulling them off.  Definitley something I would use as a permanent fixture.  It's too much of a hassle to take it off every time you need to plug something in.  I plugged in what I needed to and have not intention of switching them up.",2
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,"There is no way a toddler or even some adults could get to the plugs under this thing, it is very secure. However, I decided to stop using this as an over cautious mother, thinking if a child gets caught up in the cord it should be able to come free of the wall to prevent strangulation.",3
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,This thing is so hard to get off that neither you nor your children will ever get to your outlets again.  This is not a product you should buy if you want to use your outlets once in a while.  It took me 15 minutes to pry it open.,3
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"First, this product is HUGE. Second, your kids can easily put their fingers right in and flip that button.  I can even put my fingers in and they are much bigger than my 19 month old! This is not a child proofing object. It's more of a big chunk of plastic that serves no purpose whatsoever.  I would NOT buy this product.",1
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"We have two power strip covers at our house--one by safety 1st and the other by Mommy's Helper.  The Safety 1st cover far exceeds the quality and durability of the Mommy's Helper cover (whose buckles looked like they might break if opened too often.)  I like the Safety 1st cover because it allows for adjustability in length and is very wide inside, as well as looking quite sturdy.  There was plenty of width inside ours as well, so I'm no sure what other reviews were referring to.  For extra safety, we covered the unused sockets on the strip with plugs...wish I had purchased this one first!",5
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"I bought one of these to see if it would fit over an extra-long power strip. The product description wasn't entirely clear, and it turns out that the description is at the small side. Sliding the case, it can cover larger power strips.It's also remarkably child-proof. Our household has an 8-month-old who's getting into everything. While she's usually blocked from getting to the computer desks, it's smart to err on the side of caution and protect every power strip in the house.I'm very pleased with this product and will order more, now that I see how versatile, sturdy, and safe they are.",4
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"The product does work, I just have a very inventive child. The opening up top is just large enough for him to get his fingers in and still cut off the power or pull a cord.",4
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"I ordered this some time ago. I finally started using it last week. It was very difficult to figure out how to use. But, once I ready the instructions a few times I got it.  My 8 month old loves all electric cords. I needed something to protect her. For the past week this has been working.Only one side of it can I get a big 3 prong plug into it. I only need 2 openings to get in and out of so it hasn't presented itself as a major problem yet. I would purchase another one of these.",4
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"This is a perfect baby proofing tool.  The strip cover will cover most standard sized power strips.  There is a hole on the side for the power strip to plug into the outlet and a wide opening on top for it to connect to the devices plugged into it.  It is really easy to put together- just snap shut in 3 places.  It is also easy to adjust as there is a button on the side that allows you to slide it between different sizes.  Overall, best power strip cover I've seen.",5
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"What a great idea, to protect your power strip.  Wish i had one of these growing up and could have prevented a lot of nights being sent to my room without dinner.",5
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"Does the job! It's huge. But, it has to be to fit everything in there. I'm just grateful someone made something like this to keep our kids safe from electrocution. :)",5
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,My baby was unable to pull it off or remove any plugs from to power strip and it is a great product.,5
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"Doesn't fit the strip we have our computer/tv plugs in. Its too small. We intended it to use there, but are using it in our bedroom instead.",3
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"I like this and will probably order another one, but I had to switch out the power strip I wanted to originally use it for because the strip was too long. So, other than that it is great.",4
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,Easy to use!,5
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"I got this for my son's room and it would be fine except that most kid stuff has larger plugs that do not fit inside (for example for the wipes warmer).  If you are plugging in standard sizes only, it should work great.  We ended up not using it.",4
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"Seriously, I just got this, and this product is not worth a single penny. It is too bulky and gets in the way. Even when it is on its smallest setting! Not just that, but there is a large opening at the top for the cords to fit through, but the gap is so big, my kids can still unplug the cords and play with them.",1
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,Fits all of my cords (even my Apple cords) perfectly.  Works exactly as advertised.,4
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"its a great product especially if you have mobile kids, babies or toddlers. keep in mind its kind of bulky i didnt think of that when ii purchased this but still a good buy for what i needed it for!",3
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"To bulky, not what I expected or needed. Needless to say I gave it to a family member that could use it in a different area. Would not buy again.",2
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"My little one looooves plug ins.  This product prevents her from unplugging my electronic devices, from trying to plug things into the power strip, and from flipping the power strip into the off position.  It keeps my child and my electronics safe!My only critique of this item is that it seems a bit flimsy when fully extended.  The power strip for my entertainment center is a pretty standard length and size and fits in this strip cover with the cover extended fully.  When extended, the cover can wiggle, and if wiggled enough, little hands could possibly figure out how to separate the two pieces, thus gaining access to the power strip.  In an effort to avoid this scenario, I have placed the product placed far enough under my entertainment center that my child would really have to reach to get to it, so the level of concentration that it would take her to both reach for the power strip and open the cover is beyond what she is capable of doing.I am still satsified with this product despite its weakness when fully extended, however, because when I placed the bare power strip in the exact same location, my daughter had no problem both reaching for the power strip and flicking it into the off position.  Furthermore, seeing all those cords, outlets, and plugs motivated her to move the power strip to where she could reach it better and within a matter of moments, she would happily turning it on and off, unplugging things, and trying to ""plug"" foreign objects into it.  So another thing this product succeeds in doing is making the power strip less attractive for her by covering up all the things she likes most about them- buttons, plug ins, and outlets.If this device were more readily accessible (ie: out in the open) I think my daughter would have no problem figuring out how to open it and thus rendering it useless.  It might not have the same problem with a smaller power strip because the product wouldn't need to be fully extended.",4
Safety 1st Grow with Me Portable Booster Seat,"My reason for purchasing a booster chair is because it is a space saver in my small kitchen (as compared to my 16 month old daughter's high chair).  I have only used this one for 1.5 weeks so far, but I find it to be quite efficient.  It's very basic, but serves its purpose.  My daughter seems to be comfortable with in it.  I either use the tray or push her up to the dinner table next to me.  I have not used it on the go yet so I can't speak on that aspect of it.  However, I think it's pretty much worth its price.",4
Safety 1st Grow with Me Portable Booster Seat,"This chair is terrific!  We go out to eat a lot, and my 7 month old is still too small for the restaurant high chairs or booster seats - she pretty much slides right out of them.  The three point harness keeps her in the chair, and the tray keeps her from leaning too far forward, as well as giving her a focal point.  Since she can't reach beyond the tray, anything that goes on the tray can go in her mouth.There are also two height adjustments and it folds well for easy carrying.  The only thing that keeps me from giving this a fifth star is how hard it is to put the tray on or take it off.",4
Safety 1st Grow with Me Portable Booster Seat,"My first son got this booster when he was 2 years old and we mostly used it when we traveled. But when my second son was born a year later, we got tired of having his big high chair in the kitchen. So when he was big enough, we strapped the booster to a chair and that was his place until a few months ago when he decided he wanted to sit in a regular chair (at almost 3).Unlike other reviewers, I have never had any problems with the tray--either keeping it on securely or getting it off easily (I think it is kind of funny that one product can have both of these problems!). The straps have always been adjustable to fit several sizes of kitchen chairs.I will admit it saves food well--to really get out a messy meal we take it outside and shake it upsided down then take the seat out. We did sort of solve the food under the chair issue by putting a dish towel on the seat of the kitchen chair before setting the booster on it. Then all you have to do is take the booster off and fold up the towel to clean the chair underneath!I loved this chair because it meant no highchair to climb over in the kitchen! And if we needed to go visiting we could just throw it in the trunk and have a highchair wherever we needed it.I'd buy it again in a minute. But someone won't have to where I live because I am Freecycling it to someone who can get even more use out of it.By the way, this one outlasted a different brand booster that my parents' bought for their house that was used half as much and was pretty much broken in two places when they pitched it earlier this year.",5
Safety 1st Grow with Me Portable Booster Seat,"This booster is a great space saver, but it is very hard to clean. Food falls down the cracks on the sides and in the back. I usually have to unstrap the seat from the chair and clean underneath it. We do like the fact that our daughter can sit up to the table at dinnertime.",3
Safety 1st Grow with Me Portable Booster Seat,This fold up booster seat is great. I noticed some people complained about the cracks holding food but we just take it apart and put it in the dishwasher like the directions say (only problem is springs in the tray rust). We also occasionally using it on the floor to when our son wants to draw (rub crayongs on paper).,5
Safety 1st Grow with Me Portable Booster Seat,I bought this seat and returned it.  It didn't fit on our dining room chairs very well.  The buckles clip kind of low in the back.  I didn't feel this was very secure.  My daughter is a climber.  I was afraid if she leaned over to far that the seat would flip.  We purchased a another one that fits much better.,2
Safety 1st Grow with Me Portable Booster Seat,"We originally bought this seat because we lived in a small apartment, and only had room for a highchair we could strap onto a kitchen chair.  It is a very durable product.  It is a good space saver, and I like the fact that it comes with a tray, and the tray does fit in the dishwasher :).  However, our tray comes off VERY easily (my daughter merely pushed a little and it popped right off).  Also, on certain chairs, we cannot get the straps that fasten it to a chair to tighten enough, so the seat moves around a lot.  (And the straps are easy to lose if you don't keep close track of them.) Like some of the other reviewers, I found it to be a good food storage area! Seriously, food gets caught in all the crevices, and it is not easy to clean unless you take it apart.  I don't know if there's a better fold-up booster seat/highchair out there, but I would only recommend this seat for going places, and then to use it with close supervision.  We now only use it when we go somewhere or go in the backyard, and I'll be darned if I can keep those straps with the seat!! We have to put it on the ground now because we can't fasten it to a chair.  We have a real highchair in our house now that we have some room, but I would like to switch to a booster (my son is 2 1/2--it's about time).  I don't want to bring this one in the house because it's so hard to clean up after meals (the booster and the chair underneath--unless you want to scrub the finish off your chairs because you didn't know the food was leaking down under the booster!).  On the positive side, the seat has lasted 6 years and is still in great condition.  I just wish the seat were designed better!",3
Safety 1st Grow with Me Portable Booster Seat,"I was given this booster seat from a friend.  I live in a really tiny house - so tiny that there is no room for a kitchen table! Because of this, at first I didn't think I would find much use for a booster seat.  Was I ever wrong.  I use it in the living room so my daughter can (have a dry) snack with me, play with play doh, draw, etc.  I just attach the back of the chair to the coffee table leg so that the chair is stable.  It is also much easier to bring along to functions as compared to a high chair. It also comes in handy when we are one high chair short, such as when we had a Passover dinner at my dad's house and my friends brought along their 2 year-old; instead of having them lug their high chair down there, I brought along the booster seat.",4
Graco ultraclear baby monitor,"Only being able to compare this product with an old Fisher Price monitor I can say that this monitor is crystal clear. The old Fisher Price one gave out a constant fussy hum and picked up far to much noise around the room (eg the wind blowing past our windows). I'm confused though about the packaging between this Graco Ultra Clear Monitor and with the 'Graco Clear Range Monitor' the only apparent difference being 'microchip technology' while both are using 'telephone technology'. However I guess the extra $10 is worth it because this is definately crystal clear, without hissing and without interference. It genuinely only picks up our babies sounds. It is not interfering with our 2.4Ghz cordless phone and I have no idea about the review which says 'it's too loud'. Turn the volume all the way up and only when you put a monitor to your ear can you hear hissing, which is why you only need the volume set down to 2 or 3 (out of 4). It has two channels and so far I've not even had need to try a different channel due to static or interference. Who needs 2.4Ghz monitors (for greater range) like the Sony one- unless you plan on mowing the grass outside while monitoring? And the advantage here is you're provided with two monitors not just one.",5
Graco ultraclear baby monitor,"I am currently looking for a monitor for our second child.  We bought this one for our first child 2 years ago.  We thought we were buying quality, but this thing started getting more static at 3 months...then [just like the reader from MA] it stopped working completely.  What a waste of money!!",1
Graco ultraclear baby monitor,Love this monitor!  This monitor is so clear... I can hear my baby move in his crib and the base is across the room from his crib.  From the day we brought him home from the hospital we have used this monitor and it has never failed us!  We recently traveled to another state to visit friends and took the monitor to use while we were there... our friends live in a condo complex with a pool.  This monitor worked from the pool... which was 4 units away from their unit and on the opposite side of the building.  (Don't worry... my friend was in the kitchen the whole time because her kids were sleeping in another room.)  My friends were so impressed that they gave away their monitor after we left and bought a GRACO Ultra Clear Monitor to use for their two boys.  So glad we have this one!  Highly recommend!!!,5
Graco ultraclear baby monitor,"I can't tell you how clear this monitor is!  I could hear my preemie baby sucking his pacifier with the base across the room from his crib, and that's not even something I normally hear when I'm with him.  Having two receivers is wonderful, I don't have to move one from room to room depending on where I'll be.  And not having batteries in the base really doesn't matter, because if the electricity is out, there's nothing else in the house to make noise that would prevent you from hearing baby.  It's not interrupted by our high powered cordless phones or the video monitor, either.  I highly recommend it!",5
Graco ultraclear baby monitor,After reading the reviews I was very worried about all of the problems I read about.  I have not however encountered any of these with this monitor.  This monitor comes in very clear you can even hear the baby breathing!  I like the dual monitors I leave one in a stationary location and the other I carry around with me.  This way I have one on with the electricity but can also use a battery in the mobile one.  Once I read the reviews and decided on this monitor I did have trouble finding it.  I found it at Target.  I would definitly buy this product again.,5
Graco ultraclear baby monitor,"I'm a fan of Graco products in general, and this monitor does not disappoint.  The base is very sensitive, so it transmits even the smallest sounds from your baby's room.  The dual receivers work even when on different floors from the transmitter - in our 3-level, 2,400 sq ft house there's no spot I've found that doesn't get reception.  Best of all, the frequency doesn't cross our phones, computer network or any of our other electronics.  Highly recommended!!",5
Graco ultraclear baby monitor,"After trying 2 other monitors, this one is wonderful.  It gets great reception inside and out (I can get some yard work done!).  I have a 2-story house with a basement and get reception on all 3 levels.  Excellent product!",5
Safety First Cabinet and Drawer Latches - 12-Pack,"Better then the new model, but still a pain to install and dont work all the time. But still better then the other that breaks the head all the time. If it does not work all the time why do it?",2
Safety First Cabinet and Drawer Latches - 12-Pack,"Personally I found these a hassle to install, ignore the included directions and break out your drill to make pilot holes.  Also difficult to adjust alignment side-to-side, so drill the holes right!  Works great for cabinets once installed correctly.  I gave up on installing them in drawers.",3
Safety First Cabinet and Drawer Latches - 12-Pack,We purchased these--fairly easy to install as long as you have a drill.  Keeping baby out so far.  Used when tot locks were to hard to locate with magnet-better than them by far.,3
Safety 1St/Dorel Oven Lock 241 Child Safety,"I like the lock, however the sticky tape that comes with it does not hold well.  I need to get some better tape and then it may stay on better.  It does at lease deter my daughter and she hasn't tried to open it since I put it on the oven.",3
Safety 1St/Dorel Oven Lock 241 Child Safety,"This item won't attach to a regular stove because the adhesive won't stick to the sides.  Also, it comes unlocked too easily if you can manage to get it to stick to the oven.",2
Safety 1St/Dorel Oven Lock 241 Child Safety,"We love this oven lock. It does what it is supposed to and the adhesive seems to be working extremely well. It was hard to attach at first because there are three pieces and with only two hands it's hard to hold all the pieces where they need to go. It doesn't get too hot to touch when the oven is on, which is great so that I can have it locked while I'm cooking and then unlock it without getting burned to take the food out.",5
Safety 1St/Dorel Oven Lock 241 Child Safety,Does what it is supposed to.  Basic and easy too use and little ones can't figure it out.,5
Blind Cord Wind Ups,"If you're using them to simply get the cords out of reach then they'll likely be ok.  However, if you will actually be raising and lowering the blinds then these DO NOT work at all.",1
Blind Cord Wind Ups,This works but it is just a container to hold the cords.  It does not wind and unwind without opening.  We ended up just cutting our cords to shorten them.,2
Blind Cord Wind Ups,Do not waste your money or time on these-completely useless this product is garbage! They are being returned anything would work better than this,1
Blind Cord Wind Ups,"I bought these for my plantation blinds.  If you have lightweight venetian blinds with very short cords, this might be useful.  I can not wind up enough cord to shorten it enough to keep out of reach. And if I do get it short enough, then when I try to actually open the blinds this thing pops off.  they are hard to keep on.  Also, if they are within reach of the child, they create a strangulation hazard because they create a loop.  I am going to replace these with cleats next to my windows.",1
Blind Cord Wind Ups,"these do get the job done.... if you have really long cords they still hang down pretty low, but they still are high enough to keep out of my son's reach. before i just had a nail up on the wall and had the string up on it, and that did the trick too, but this is a bit easier. (my son is 15 months) I for the life of me could not figure out how to put the dang thing together. the package instructions didnt make sense to me, and i even looked up instructions online. maybe i'm just blonde, i dont know. I was just horribly confused. i ended up just doing what i thought looked right, and it worked out, but i'm not sure if it's the ""correct"" way. it was very inexpensive and it got the job done, so overall i'm pretty happy with it. just wish it went up higher. I guess for the money, I would recommend it.",3
Blind Cord Wind Ups,"I've had these up on my windows for about 3 months now and have had no problems with them falling off or anything. My son hasn't tried to pull at them yet and if he ever does, I dont know how well they will hold up but for the price, they are a pretty gold safety meAsure. They definitely keep the cords wound up above his reach so hopefully pulling on them wont ever be an issue anyway. So yeah, no complaints here",4
Blind Cord Wind Ups,TOTALLY Useless! The 2 pieces will not stay together when you put any kind of pressure on the cord.  Get some retrofits at Window Coverings Safety Council instead!,1
Graco Deluxe Tot-Lock with Tray and High Back Seat - Navy Gingham Pattern,"I had my first un-interrupted restaurant dinner after I used this hook-on chair.  My 6-month old daughter just sat there, watched us eat, happily banging on the tray with her little hands without wanting to be held.  Absolutely the best money I have ever spent on a baby product!",5
Graco Deluxe Tot-Lock with Tray and High Back Seat - Navy Gingham Pattern,"I can't say enough good things about this chair!!  We love it!  It is really easy to use on a wide range of tables.  We mainly use it at our bar, but it fits well on all of the tables we've tried it on so far.  It is a great thing to have for going to dinner with friends or family.  It also comes in handy when having company with a small child as one can use this and the other can use the high chair.  Folds up easily to travel.The tray is a bit tough to get on and off, but that is probably good so that the child can't pinch their fingers.I do have one complaint and that is regarding the strap. It is the kind that has one center piece and the two side straps snap into the center.  It holds the child in securely, but doesn't always come unsnapped on one side very easily.  I also have a Graco swing with the same snap &amp; have had the same problem.  This can be a bit frustrating, but is definitely not enough to keep me from highly recommending this item!",5
Graco Deluxe Tot-Lock with Tray and High Back Seat - Navy Gingham Pattern,We bought this chair to use in our motorhome and now we use it everywhere.  We always take to the restaurants with us.  It works great on most sturdy tables and we love when we get a booth.  Our son was also able to use it earlier than the restaurant chairs because it has a higher back on it and he is always at the right level with the table.  Another feature I love is that he has his own tray (which can be removed).  This way he always has a clean place to eat!!  We highly recommend this product.,5
Graco Deluxe Tot-Lock with Tray and High Back Seat - Navy Gingham Pattern,"We absolutely LOVE our Graco Deluxe Tot-Lock Chair!!  Our son is 9 months old and we have most certainly already got our money worth!We love that fact that every time we eat out we know that he's eating on a clean surface. He is always buckled in and I don't need to worry about the germs that are on the restaurant high chairs.  We can very easily sit in a booth, which is definitely more comfortable than sitting at a table.We take this chair with us everywhere.  When we fly to visit relatives, it comes right along with us.  It easily fits into our suitcase and doesn't take a lot of room.  It connects to almost every single table!!You do need to be careful with some tables, as they can be flimsy and move. In cases like that, I plop my husband across from my son and all is well!I highly recommend this chair to EVERYONE, it's a must have!",5
Graco Deluxe Tot-Lock with Tray and High Back Seat - Navy Gingham Pattern,We got this to take when we visit grandma or eat out. Now my daughter insists on sitting in it at home. We have put the high chair away and this seat is a great space saver! It's super easy to set up and remove from the table which makes cleaning a breeze.,5
Graco Deluxe Tot-Lock with Tray and High Back Seat - Navy Gingham Pattern,We like this seat and it allows the baby to be part of the family.  One problem... your table must be flat on the underside... I have a table I intended this for that has framing between the four legs only  about three inches in from the side of the table... this makes this chair unusable.  You need about 7 inches on the underside of your table that are flat for the chair to be properly set up.,4
Graco Deluxe Tot-Lock with Tray and High Back Seat - Navy Gingham Pattern,"I saw this while browsing and decided to get it on a whim, and I am so pleased with it. It is very nice to take into restaurants and you KNOW your highchair is clean. It puts them at your level and they feel part of the family. I love that it has a tray so again, sanitary eating surface. The plastic is easy to wipe down, but we haven't had any big messes to clean from the crevices, so I can't complain about that yet. It feels very secure once attached and the only thing to watch is that the table won't tip from the unbalanced weight. Two things I wish were easier, first, depending on the table thickness, we sometimes have to put the chair part-way on and put our daughter in before securing it tightly to the table, so it really takes 2 of us to do it safely. She just can't maneuver into the seat otherwise. And second, it is a bit bulky even though it folds almost flat. It folds to about 12&quot;x24&quot; (I am guessing, don't quote that) but we just leave it in the cargo area of the SUV and it's not bad. Really is a hassle when carrying the baby, diaper bag, and this seat at the same time, so I use it only when I have someone to help me. Once in place, it has been a wonderful purchase! Well worth the effort!",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,Works great but beyond a nightmare to install. Get ready for a learning curve perhaps 30mins for the first then 15 for the rest by the time you install and adjust doors to work well. Once in fantastic!,4
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"My husband and I installed these and experienced the same problem as the previous reviewer. The magnet seemed too weak to work well. But the set includes extensions.  The hole needs to be drilled deep enough so that the magnet comes close to the front of the cabinet door. (I suggest putting a piece of masking tape on the drill bit, so that you can make the hole deep enough without going through the cabinet door.)  When the hole is deep enough & the extension used, it works well.  And there's even a latch to keep it unlocked, if you want to keep it unlocked without uninstalling the whole thing.",4
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"Magnets rule.  These things may be a more challenging install but if you think it through and go slow they do indeed work as advertised.  Just don't try to do it in a hurry or with your toddler ""supervising"" because you will get distracted, break something, and/or teach them a new word or two!Some tips that may save some time and energy, both of which you obviously need considering aforementioned toddler.GET THE FULL SIZE INSTRUCTION SHEET!Yes yes, the instruction sheet blows.  Even laser eye surgery won't help you see the diagrams clearly enough.  But after a bit of hunting I found a PDF of them online which you can ZOOM into and see everything MUCH clearer!  Go to the safety first website at safety1st.com and search for instructions for product number 71175.  Print, have a beer and read em through.Consider all surfaces before installation:The top frame of our sink cabinet had stuff in the way and the double doors don't have a center post.  Doh.  But after a time-out and another beer, I realized I could  try attaching the strike plate to the inside bottom of the cabinet and it works just as well.  So before thinking it doesn't work, ignore the diagrams and evaluate which edge will work best.From experience... avoid drilling 4 holes then re-drilling 4 more:SKIP the second part of Instruction #2 that says to mark the 4 holes for the lock first.  Just drill the center hole for the magnet plunger thingy  first.  I did as the instructions say and because I was a bit off on the center hole (remember the beer) all 4 of those holes were useless.  On subsequent installs, I would insert the lock (good time to test it too) and then once it's all groovy, use the actual lock in position to mark and pre-drill the 4 holes to attach the lock to the cabinet.Save money:  use fewer Tot Loks on double doors:Before you buy 20 of these... One money saver idea...  if you have any cabinets that have ""double doors"" that meet in the middle, you can reduce your costs by just using a tot lok on one of them, then place an inexpensive sliding surface bolt or other interior cabinet latch (from any hardware store) on the inside of the second door.  Open one, reach over and pop the second one when you need that side open.  I did this on the lesser used, garbage disposal side of the sink cabinet and thus impressed the wife with my unusual frugality and common sense.Hope this is helpful!",4
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"As previous reviewers have stated, these locks are very difficult to install. Mine did come with a drill bit stop, but I had to go buy the right bit for the drill. Then the stop did not work, it was too loose on the bit, even though we bought the size suggested in the instructions. This resulted in drilling through one cabinet door. Then on the second door, despite being very careful, my husband drilled through even with the stop on the bit. After some measuring, we came to the realization that the lock would only work if installed in a spot where the front of the cabinet was cut in to give it a paneled/beveled look. This makes the door too narrow, so that the lock is impossible to install without drilling all the way through it. We still have this lock on the doors we drilled through, because it works well and we have not been able to get replacement doors yet, we can't find them! So yes, it works great once installed. If you have thick doors and don't mind the hassle, go ahead and get them. Otherwise keep looking.",3
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"We have 5 of the Tot-Loks and 2 magnets.  Three of the locks are in the bathroom and 2 protect the chemicals under the sink.  The installation of the locks took a little more time than other systems, but only took 30 minutes to install all the locks.  We have some friends that use the locks that you have to push down the arm to get the door open, they are always complaining that their toddler smashing his finger trying to get the door open.  Don't have to worry about smashed fingers with these locks.  Also don't have to worry about glue from adhesives ruining the front of your cabinets.  Once removed there is only a small hole on the inside of the door.  We don't lock our drawers since we do not keep any knives in the drawers, so I can't state how well they work on drawers.  But they are a great product and have suggested them to anyone with a toddler or expecting.",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"I saw a few negative reviews on these locks that made me hesitant to purchase them, but when my 18 month old son came in the living room holding the freeze off wart can, that was it! They have such little arms and fingers; he reached right under the sink that had the traditional plastic child proof locks. I bought the 2 pack to try it and was so very careful because as some of the reviews said, you can drill right on through the cabinet and that is quite true, I almost did it on the first one I did. I blame my husband for distracting me, but I was holding the drill. Take it slow and BE CAREFUL! Consider turning the speed of your drill down so it doesn't get away on you. It's worth it, and as long as you use the little magnet extenders they give you, it will work awesome! As for being tricky, yes you have to read the directions. The first one took me about 30 minutes to figure out, but then it was easy! I ordered more and I just now put 2 more on, in about 10 minutes and they work super! If you need extra keys like we did, consider buy another couple of 2 packs, you pay $7.99 for an extra key and only get the key. For 3 bucks more you can get 2 more locks and the key and put them maybe in the kitchen where you have more cabinets. Just stick the key on the fridge, high up away from little fingers and you always know where it is! I'm very impressed with this safety lock system and won't use anything else.",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"I wouldn't consider myself a handyman at all, and these locks were easy to install. It seems like people who had a problem installing these either A)were afraid of/didn't know how to use a drill B)had abnormally thick cabinets or C)didn't read the instructions.  Just follow the instructions, and you'll be fine.  Our cabinets don't budge an inch, and I'm confident that my daughter won't be able to pry them open.  Heck, I can't pry them open.  They are more expensive than the other kinds, so we just got these for our cabinets that have sharp objects or chemicals in them.  For the other drawers and cabinets, we just used the cheap, plastic hooks.Overall, very good, very effective, and very easy to install.",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"Love these. Not the easiest to install and they may take a little getting used to, but so worth it! They are really secure and do not interfere with the appearance of your cabinets. Would recommend in a heartbeat!",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"Being a woman and I installed 5 locks by myself it wasn't that bad.  This is the best thing I ever bought.  It takes some thinking and organizing and then you are on your way.  You cannot just start drilling, you have to study the pictures and the instructions.  But at the end it pays off.",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"I guess we should have known, having had poor experiences with Safety First products in the past, but even with that past experience, we were dumbfounded at the cheaply made, poorly designed garbage that is this system.  I guess, if you don't love your children, and you don't care for your beautiful cabinetry, go out and buy one of these....or five.  We installed it, it didn't work.  We returned it.  We are very unhappy!",1
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,These were impossible to install.  We ended up returning them.  My husband builds his own furniture and is very handy with tools.  He could not get these to work if his life depended on it.,1
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"This is a wonderful product!  I tried several brands of the traditional plastic cupboard toddler locks and they kept breaking or the cupboard could still be pulled open.  Tot lok is strong and unopenable without the key.  Plus, it does not compromise the look of my cupboards either.  The instructions are easy to follow for proper installation.  I can't say enough about this great product!  Highly reccommended!",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"I bought this to defeat the prying hands of my 2 year old. I lost.The device is phenomenal in concept and even drilling holes did not deter me. I was able to get this to work fabulously for cabinets and pieces of wood under 1.125"" thick--before you add the ""Extension Slug"". In a sentence, any cabinet thicker than 1.125"" is entirely non-functional.The magnet that comes with the lock is great and strong--and activates the lock consistently across the 3 packs of locks I bought through 1/8"" of wood so long as you're not using the extension slug. The extension pin, however is fully functional. Once you add the extension slug, the device stops working entirely.",1
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Starter Set,"We tried the tab and hook kind, where you push down the tab to disengage it from the hook, but those still allow your kid (and you) to get your finger smashed in the drawer, and kids figure them out pretty quick. Even the small gap needed to get your finger in to depress the tab is like a mile wide gap for small hands.  Installing them is a bear, with lots of trial and error, and usually no templates to help you. They also tend to collect grime, and they break or loosen up a lot over time.These are great!  The doors/drawers remain firmly shut until the magnetic lock is disengaged with the ""key"".  The directions are good, and they include a sticky template for each lock.  I will say that you need to read the instructions and make sure how your hardware is supposed to be lined up. I screwed up the first one I ever did, which was more me hurrying and screwing up some spacial relations as far as what direction things needed to be in than bad instructions.  After that the rest (we have quite a few of these installed) went smoothly.The sticky templates are especially helpful making sure everything is where it's supposed to be. If you have thick doors (we have really thick, hardwood cabinet doors) they have extender slugs that effectively lengthen the magnetic catch.  Even if you have to have a handyman install these they're well worth it!One note: It does take some trial and error to get the hang of what spot you have to pass the ""key"" over to disengage the lock. But you get the hang of it quickly.",5
Secure Grip Door Knob Covers,"Assuming your child was born with 2 functioning hands, don't waste your money.  My cat could figure these things out.",1
Secure Grip Door Knob Covers,This product is great!  Keeps two year old out of pantry and basement door.  Don't have to worry about her falling down the basement stairs as she can open all other doors with ease.,5
Secure Grip Door Knob Covers,The hole in the middle is just the right size for little fingers to get in. My son realized this immediately. They manufacturers really need to think of a more clever design. The covers did however successfully keep me out when I needed to open the door. I therefore think it should be called ""parentproof"".,2
Secure Grip Door Knob Covers,"This product works but it is cheap plastic and won't last long and if you don't have large doorknobs the product is much too big.  The package says it should spin freely on the knob but on our doorknobs it sags too.  This would be fine for larger knobs, though only if there is adequate supervision as well, because I think a determined child could break the plastic given a bit of time.",2
Secure Grip Door Knob Covers,"I have a 2 year old, that ended up walking down the driveway with this on the door. I was watering my flowers, and she was in the house with Daddy and sissy, next thing I know, she is standing right next to me laughing. I brought her back in the house, and watched as she opened the door as quickly as I do. Doesn't stop her at all, doesn't even slow her down.",1
Secure Grip Door Knob Covers,"These knob covers worked well at our house, from when our kids were 1 1/2 til they were 4 and more.  They are intended to fit loosely over your door knob, so the cover spins freely when a child touches it, and the knob doesn't turn.  Your child should not be able to open the door until they are taller, and their hands are bigger, to be able to press buttons on opposite sides of the knob cover at the same time.After the covers were over a year old, we replaced a few because the rubber on the inside was getting sticky and so the covers gripped too much, and the knob could be turned by a child tall enough to press down on the top.When our kids were 4, the tallest one began to be able to open the doors with these covers on.  But they got us through the most difficult years, when saying ""no"" isn't enough to stop the kids going to unsafe areas.Our kids are now 5 years old (triplets), and we still have these knob covers on our doors to go outside.  Those doors are stiff and heavy enough that the kids can't open them without help.  And we are glad they can't leave the house without us knowing about it!It's too bad these don't work for all kids, for all doors.  But for the modest price, it's worth trying them.  You might get a lot of peace of mind.",4
Safety 1st Seat Belt Adjuster,"This is a good way to get the shoulder strap off your neck without any fuss.  There isn't too much more to say, except your small person will love not having the shoulder strap around their neck any more.",4
Safety 1st Seat Belt Adjuster,These are not just for children. I used mine all the time. It really helps to keep the shoulder strap from grabbing you across the neck. It is so much more comfortable to wear a seat belt now. I have bought several as gift for friends and they love them too.,5
Safety 1st Seat Belt Adjuster,"This item is NOT SAFE.  The lap belt portion of the seat belt should rest on the hips/thighs of the passenger.  Devices like this can cause the lap belt to ride up onto the soft part of the abdomen, which can cause serious internal injuries in a crash.  If your child is too short to use the seatbelt properly (no putting it behind their back, and no shoulder belt across the neck/face) they should still be in a booster seat!  Most children are not ready for just a seatbelt until they are at least 8 years old and 80 pounds.  Take the money you would put towards this product and get a booster seat instead.",1
Safety 1st Seat Belt Adjuster,"I ordered five of these so that my disabled son would have this seat belt adjuster in every car he rides in.  It is easy to install, easy to adjust and stays in place well.  My son is 12, and needs to be secured in the seat belt without it choking him.  It took him a little while to adjust to it, but now it's not even an issue.  He has used it in all five cars, and we have all been pleased with it - especially for the price!  I am very pleased with this product and would reccommend it to anyone.",5
Safety 1st Seat Belt Adjuster,I have two of these adjusters and have been using them since my kids were 5 years old.  They take a few minutes to put on properly but they work and the kids can clip themselves in....Yeah!!!!  They are excellent when traveling!!!  I will be buying yet another one in a few months.,4
Safety 1st Seat Belt Adjuster,My wife is one of the ""little"" people.This is more confortable than other alternitives.,5
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,My husband finally installed the magnetic locks and I absolutely love them.  I can't comment on the installation as I stayed away for that part but the locks work great. I love the fact that you don't have to open a drawer or door and smash your finger in the process of trying to unlock it. I believe this is item is well worth the price.,5
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,"This is a very nice product, and does exactly what you'd expect it to do. My only two gripes are: (1) It's true that the first one is hard to install. The instructions are a bit hard to follow, and I think an adhesive version would be a big seller. (2) The extra kets are expensive. Otherwise, I really, really like the product. It's exactly what I was looking for, completely invisible, and my child can't possibly defeat this unless we leave the key within reach. Buy an extra key with the kit or you won't be able to get in either if and when you lose the enclosed key. A regular refrigerator magnet will NOT work as a emergency back up key.",4
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,"My sister and brother-in-law had these and I wanted some too.  I wish I would have read the many negative reviews on these before I purchased them and drilled holes in my kitchen drawers.  The bottom line is, like many of the negative reviewers point out, these will not, and do not work on hard wood solid drawers.  They may work for cabinet doors only, and after my experience I would be skeptical of those as well unless they are really cheap plywood cabinets.  The idea behind these is they open by using a magnetic key that, in theory, unlocks the locking mechanism by placing the magnet on the front front of the drawer or door. However it is not powerful enough to pass through the outsides of my drawers to engage the mechanism (and I drilled ""drill bit is not included"" almost to the very edge of the front of my drawer.  That is going through a half inch of solid wood of the drawer cover, and also a half inch of the interior of the drawer. I even used the extra metal extender slug included in the package.  Nada. They do not work and there is nothing I can do to make them work.  The bad part is I bought them through ebay.  Lesson learned there.  Cannot return them. I am really not sure if these are even designed for drawers.  Be warned folks.",1
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,"This a great tool to keep toddlers out of cabinets. I've tried the product that latches on the cabinet or drawers and I found them harder to install. This install can be rather tricky but it's worth it once they are in place. It comes with a guide to help you figure out where the screws go, the main tricky part is drilling the required hole and stopping just before you go all the way through your cabinet. Although it comes with a piece that helps you know where to stop, you have to do one cabinet to figure this out first.",5
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,"So far so good after a couple of weeks. Just be careful not to drill your pilot holes to deep because the screws are short. Made the mistake on the first one, but after that one it went smoothly. The templet was perfect and all works well.And it's child pull tested.  She is a strong one and has been testing it out.",5
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,"This is simply a great product.  It is installed inside the cabinet so there is nothing to see from the front.  The newer models work even easier than the original ones we purchased years ago.  They open easily when the magnet is put near (don't even need to touch the cabinet door).  We use these in several places over the house and love the convenience, but piece of mind it gives.  They are also pretty strong - our 3 1/2 year old pulls and tries to open sometimes and has not broken or pulled open any drawer.NOTE - The old version needed a drill to make a small hole on the lock which sits inside the door, but the newer ones like this no longer require that hole to be made. These work better and are easier to install - just need a screwdriver and a few minutes.",5
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,"Such a great idea but...installation is ridiculously difficult but I suffered through to protect my child.  I ended up with holes in my nice furniture and a system that will not work.  My entertainment center is a hardwood, maybe that's a factor I don't know, but my cabinets aren't thick enough for the extension slug so I'm at a loss.  Maybe I'll look for a stronger magnet and try again since the damage is already done.Oh well I guess that's why they make wood filler and stain, just add that to my list of a million projects.",1
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,"My husband and I had some trouble installing these. As others have said before, make sure you swipe the key over the lock BEFORE closing the door to ensure that it works properly (it should click and release easily). If not, you might end up like we did being completely locked out of our cabinet! When I called customer service, they were not helpful at first and suggested I find a stronger magnet to open the door. I kept asking to speak with someone who knew the product well. Finally, I spoke with a wonderful representative who told me the problem was probably that I had not drilled far enough into the cabinet. I was able to pull the door open just enough to fit a thin, metal shish-kabob skewer between the door and the lock to release the lock. We drilled a bit deeper into the cabinet and it worked! Now, these locks work beautifully. As soon as we slide the key over the area, it unlocks quickly and easily. Also, make sure to measure the depth of the cabinet and add the extra slugs as recommended. We really like these locks! It is so easy to keep them in the unlocked position for times when there are no children in the house.",4
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,Set up is a bit timely but they are great. We bought a house that had them just needed a few more. The lock an be deactivated which is really convenient.,5
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,"My son's first reaction to his new 'big boy' furniture was to open the drawers and climb up.  We tried the lesser expensive spring locks, but he can still open the drawers a little bit and climb up.  That's when I found the tot locks and the drawers do not budge unless you have the key.  I love the option where he can't pry the drawer open to climb.  Spring locks are good in our kitchen for easy frequent access, but for a bedroom tot locks are perfect!  I've read reviews where they are difficult to install, I had no issues at all with directions or install.",5
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,"We tried Safety 1st's alternative cabinet lock, the kind you press down with your fingers just inside the cabinet door, as well as Tot Lok. We put some of each system on various cabinets in the kitchen. Tot Lok is vastly superior to the other kind. It works every time instead just most of the time; it makes it impossible for our 18-month-old to smash her fingers in the drawers and cabinets; it is strong and secure.",5
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,These are great for keeping the little ones out. They don't require much to install. There is a template included so you get everything lined up perfectly the first time and drill your holes in the correct space. That's right if you don't want to add holes to your cabinet then these aren't for you. They are easy to disengage and they have an unlock switch for when you don't have to worry about the little one getting into the cabinet.,5
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,"Love these, my son can not open anything now. Everything is totally safe in our home now because of these",5
Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,This product is very easy to install and is the best of all child safety locks.  It's magnetic system is easy for parents but impossible for kids. =),5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Magnetic Key,"We have the Safey 1st  tot locks on our chemical, bathroom, and treat cabinets, and we used to have 4 magnets.

So to bpass the locks, you can unscrew a hinge if they're external or snake your. arrm thrgh a drawer if you're lucky.Anyway..  I'm one of those guys that kees hard. drive magnnets around and I'm using that until I get the 2 magnets I just ordered.Also, If your kids are acrobats, you should look at mounting a cupboad hook in the cieling away from climbable objects.  Hang a key ring where both adults can reach it with arm fully extended and tha should solve the snack pilferage ;)",4
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Magnetic Key,This key has more magnetism than the one that came in the kit.  Key will actually hold on the outside of the cabinet door and seems to unlock with more authority.  Like it.  Keep the original kit key as a spare.,5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Magnetic Key,"I'd have to suggest that the other reviews were either sour grapes over the price of the magnet alone (reasonable, and I can't figure out why a magnet alone is so much compared to a kit with locks included) or a misunderstanding about how the product works.The reviewer who downrated because ""it's only a magnet"" may not realize that the lock itself if MECHANICAL (plastic interfaces that interlock) with a MAGNETIC RELEASE.  The drawer/cabinet is NOT kept closed via magnet.I might suggest moving over to the kits that contain the magnet along with the locks, however.  You'll need several magnets unless you are locking multiple cabinets in the same room.",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Magnetic Key,We had to get a replacement after one of our &#34;keys&#34; grabbed a cookie sheet on the way into the oven. Having 2 makes life so much easier. Our youngest is lovely called a hurricane based on her path of destruction.,5

Safety 1st Hospital's Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,This thermometer is awful.  I tired several times to get a reading on myself and my husband and it always read 93 degrees or below.  I finally used the old standby digital thermometer and it worked perfect.  I do not recommend this product to anyone!,1
Safety 1st Hospital's Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,"I'm not sure why everyone seems to be having trouble finding covers, I found mine at my local [store] (and it's a tiny store).  With my last child I had a Thermoscan, and I liked it a little better only because the covers were easier to put on, but this is still a great item",4
Safety 1st Hospital's Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,"This thermometer does appear to be accurate (when tested on myself), however it is very difficult to use on an infant.  My daughter is 3 months old now, and I still find it difficult (and a little scary) to use on her.  She wiggles around so much that the scanner is usually out of her ear before it is done.  I am also hesitant to use it in fear that she will jerk her head and end up getting poked in the ear or eye.  I think it will get plenty of use - just not yet.",3
Safety 1st Hospital's Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,"I bought this thermometer for my daughter when she was first born. It is AWFUL! It gives strange readings like 94.5 and 95.1, when in fact I know that she has a fever! I bought just a regular digital rectal thermometer at the pharmacy and it gives more accurate readings. Don't buy this, its a waste of time and $$$$$$!",1
Safety 1st Hospital's Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,I was a little worried when I read these reviews about not being able to find replacement covers after I had already received this thermometer.  So I went to Babies R Us to look into exchanging it and I found 10-12 packages of 20 ea. replacement covers for this very model.  I then found them at Wal-Mart as well.  I just wanted to let all those that are having a problem know this!  Good luck.,4
Safety 1st Hospital's Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,"i got this for a baby shower gift and i ended up going out and buying a cheap digital one.  this thermometer does not give accurate readings.  i used it on my daughter and it read 94.3, to me that is pretty bad when i used the other one got a reading of 98.  i suggest buying the cheap digital ones instead. i would rate this product at 0 stars but there is no 0 rating.  so i had to give it a 1",1
Safety 1st Hospital's Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,"I bought this to take my infant's temperature, since she doesn't like to sit and wait for her temperature to be taken under her arm.  I decided to test it before she was sick to make sure it was accurate, and it never gave the same reading twice.  First it was 95.5 and then 98.5 and then 96.2, etc.  I tested it on myself, my daughter and my husband.  Then I gave the directions and the thermometer to my husband to try to see if maybe I just wasn't doing it correctly and he had the same results.  I have taken it back to Target and am trying a different brand.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!",1
Safety 1st Hospital's Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,"This product is advertised in a misleading fashion:it says that it is for all ages but it is not.  Unfortunately I did not find that out until attempting to use it on my sister's visiting sick 12 week old baby.It's scary enough dealing with a baby's fever without hearing from every doctor that you talk to that the thing is inaccurate on infants. This should be acknowledged in the packaging not (as it is) buried in the fine print of the directions. It is also very difficult to follow the instructions, and we wasted quite a few of the probe covers trying to figure it out.DON&quot;T BUY THIS AS PREPARATION FOR A NEW BABY. Go the old-fashioned rectal thermometer way, that's what your pediatrician would recommend.",1
Safety 1st Hospital's Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,i was given this thermometer for a shower gift and boy does it come in handy. The only problem i have had with it so far is finding replacement lens covers.  For all those who dont know how to change it from C to F it is really easy.  make sure the unit is off press the &quot;m&quot; it will show wether it is in &quot;f&quot; or &quot;c&quot; then turn the unit on and press &quot;m&quot; to change.  And for all those buying unit it is extremely important to save all the manuals.,4
Safety 1st Hospital's Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,"I would like to ditto (and thank!) the reviewer who suggested the CVS brand covers.  After reading her review, I purchased the covers from cvs.com . Then I thought about checking at Walgreen's, and sure enough, they carry them (same price as CVS, 40 for $5.99).  I just picked up a box today.  So I will soon have a bunch of covers, but I don't care.  I just love this thermometer.  I actually have the one with the light on it.  Outstanding product.",5
Safety 1st Hospital's Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,"I don't usually bother complaining about products, but this thermometer was such a waste of $, I just wanted to save someone else the trouble. The temperature readings on this are SOOO inaccurate. EVERY time that we check a temp. it is different, it varies alot. Just to see if it worked we tried 8 times in a row on ourselves to see what we got. Every time it was different sometimes by a few degrees. It reads low sometimes, so you may have a temperature and not be aware. And we couldn't even take it back to the store. Do yourself a favor by the regular digital thermometer.We didn't have any luck with a diffferent brand either, the ear ones are all off, but not as bad as this one.",1
Safety 1st Hospital's Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,I have tried and tried again to use this thermometer on my 7 month old and each time it reads a very low temperature.

Safety 1st Hospital's Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,"We have found that this thermometer often shows different temperatures for each ear.

We cannot find replacement covers - anywhere!  Not in stores and when we did finally order from online, the company cancelled the order due to no product.  Ours only came with 10 lens covers - hardly enough to keep using after a year.  Unless you know where you can get replacement covers, I suggest to NOT buy this item.",2
Safety 1st Hospital's Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,"We got this for our baby as a baby shower gift.  It registered accurately only twice.  Since the second usage, it registers drastically different temperatures within seconds of each reading.  Covers are also impossible to find.  Plus, I was told that I would have to wait until baby was 6 months for an ear thermometer to work properly.  She's 7 months and no change!This is a complete waste of money.  Please don't bother.  Your best guess is more accurate for your baby's temperature.  We bought a basic digital for less than half price and use arm pit temperature now.  Much closer to reality!",1
Hospital's Choice Fold Up Nail Clippers,"On the first use of this item a sliver of metal fell off.  If I was not in a well lit room and paying close attention, my 7 week old could have gotten seriously hurt.  To add salt to the wound,  I tried to return the item and I got two separate emails from the seller.  The first email asked me to describe the defect.  I responded to the email. After which, I received a second email asking me to send a picture of the item; SERIOUSLY!  1. Do you think I am storing the sliver of metal to take a picture of it?  2.  If I described the defect as a sliver of metal, the product would look the same as in the original picture of the item, as a sliver denotes a very small piece, so the seller already has a picture of what the product looks like.  3.  If the seller needed a picture, this should have been requested in the first email, not in a second email.  I shop online because I have limited time.  I do not have time to respond to an email trail for a $3 nail clip.  However, I am so irritated with the product and the seller's response that I decided to write this review.  In addition, my request to return the item was closed before the return approval process was completed!",1
Hospital's Choice Fold Up Nail Clippers,I have no complaints at all.  We had these before and lost them.  They work great and were just like the ones from years ago that we replaced.,5

Hospital's Choice Fold Up Nail Clippers,"We had the Summer Infant clippers first.  They came in a two-pack, with a smaller clipper and a larger clipper.  Neither one worked well.  The larger of the two didn't work at all.  These Safety First clippers cut every time.  For those of you who know how difficult it can be to clip a baby's nails, you also know how frustrating it can be to finally get the clipper positioned right and then have it not cut.  AAAAARRRRGGGHHHH!These work every time.",5
Hospital's Choice Fold Up Nail Clippers,"This nail cutter originally came to us in a baby-care gift set when my first daughter was born. We've used it for her and my son for about 5 years.

I finally just ordered this again through Amazon and am very pleased yet again and so is my little 3 month old.",5

It's sharp enough to cut nails on the first try and the white bulb is pretty comfortable to hold.  What more do you need in a pair of baby nail clippers?The losers:- Safety 1st model 49539 (has the holder for emery boards) - the grip is comfortable but the clippers are blunt and therefore useless.  The emery board is useful.- Dubon baby nail clipper (the kind that you wear on your finger like a ring) - has the safety guard so you don't catch the baby's skin in the clippers, but that makes it almost impossible to clip the actual nail.  Plus, it's not sharp and therefore worthless.- Nuby infant nail clipper - not bad in terms of sharpness, but something about the way it's designed makes it really difficult to get at the baby's nails.Search ends here, thank goodness!",5
Safety 1st Digital Pacifier Thermometer,"It is always difficult getting a reading from a thermometer for a sick infant. With this product, given that the infant would be used to a pacifer, works wonders. For all of my friends expecting a little one, this is a must.",5
Safety 1st Digital Pacifier Thermometer,"When I bought this item, I thought this was a really clever way to take a baby's temperature.  I use this thermometer only on occasion.  It's convenient, but it requires about 3 minutes before a final temperature is reached.  It requires that your baby keep it in his mouth for that long.  It's getting harder for my baby to accept this ""pacifier"", now that she is on the larger, 6-month-plus sized pacifiers.  Also, check with your doctor about how to take accurate readings: our pediatrician said that a rectal thermometer was the most accurate for the early weeks of her life.",4
Safety 1st Digital Pacifier Thermometer,"The thermometer only worked one time and then the battery died, and you cannot replace the battery.  This is a waste of money.  We only had it for five months and it is useless already.",1
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"We received this as a baby shower gift (after registering for it). I had hoped it would work in our kitchen sink and then fold up to store easily in our small house. However, it doesn't fit well in the sink -- either the sink is too small or too deep as it would leave the tub hanging only by the fold-up sides. And, like another reviewer said, it leaks and doesn't hold much water.While I fully understand that babies and children tend to make a mess, a slippery floor and a slippery baby aren't what I'd prefer to have at the same time.It also doesn't quite seem big enough. My son is only 8 weeks old and there's already not enough room for his legs and feet. (Granted, he was 9lbs 3oz to begin with and just keeps growing.)I think I'll be buying a bigger, bulkier tub soon - as he's still too young for me to feel comfortable bathing him in the sink and my back and knees can't take putting this tub in the bathtub.",2
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"This tub is convenient because I can fold it up and store it under my son's dresser.  My son was a big baby....well over 9 pounds by the time of his first tub bath, and now he is almost 14 pounds at 7 weeks.  His head constantly slides to the side, and there is only hard plastic on the sides, so, bath time has not been a fun experience.  I am going to start putting a rolled towel on the side, so that his head willl be cushioned.  They should have thought of this, and made a head cushion out of the foam liner, but, I don't know of many tubs where this wouldn't be the same problem.  As far as holding only a little water, I just let the water run the whole time he is in the tub, and leave the drain open, so he has a constant stream of clean, warm water on him.",3
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"This tub was given as a gift for our first baby.  Along with it, we were given one of those bath sponges that you lay in the tub and then set the baby in.  We couldn't have been happier with it.  It was shallow enough that with the sponge, the baby was snuggled just right.  She didn't slide anywhere.  It fit right onto our kitchen sink and when she was a little older we would put some water in our big bathtub and then put her into it with her tub.  She was still secure in her tub but able to enjoy her bath even more.",4
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"In my opinion this is the best tub for babies. It fit perfect on my kitchen sink, which made bath time highly convenient.  It is also the perfect size.  And the foam mat that is inside it made it so baby does not slide around. It is also reclined perfectly to keep baby in the perfect position. I got this for a shower gift for my first baby.  Then I got another tub for my second child 2 yrs later.  I ended up putting away the new one and sending my husband to the storage unit to get this one back out.  I love this tub and would reccommend it to anyone.  The only problem that I would have with it is the foam does not come out so it could harbor bacteria. I just always made sure to rinse it with antibacterial soap and HOT water after every use. No other tub compares!!",5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"This tub doesn't have any support for the baby's head, especailly when they can't sit up on their own yet. I have to constantly hold my daughters head to prevent it from falling to the side of the tub which has no paddings. And where she sits in the tub curves too much where she looks like a little ball and I'm not able to sit her forward or anything to wash her back because she doesn't have any more room to bend in the tub. I don't know how to describe it in details, but I just recommend all the moms and dads to just walk by this tub when you see it in the store!",3
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I purchased my first Fold-Up Tub back in 1997 when my 1st daughter was born. When she outgrew it, I gave it away.  Then when I had my 2nd daughter, I purchased another one.  I was completely satisfied with the tub, I am currently expecting another baby the last part of January 2002 and WILL purchase another one.  It is so convenient to use and store.  I never had any problems with the ones I bought.  I recommend this to all parents for their babies, it is affordable and works just great.",5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"This tub made bathtime horrible! Slip resitant pad my... arm! My baby slid all over the place. Now that he is 2 months he doesn't even fit in it anymore. 0-6 months, I don't think so! We bought another tub and were much happier, as is our son! Reading the other reviews I may try to use it as an after the bath seat. BEWARE every single complaint (in all the reviews) is well founded!!!!",1
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I recieved this tub as a gift at my shower. The first time I went to use it, I was alone with the baby. I put the baby in the tub and water started pouring out from the hinges. It was horrible. I tried it again and it did the same thing, even with a tiny amount of water. Please, don't waste your money.",1
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER WHEN SHE WAS 2 MONTHS OLD. NOW 8 MONTHS STILL USING IT. I LIKED THAT IT FOLDED UP FOR EASY STORAGE.  SOME OF THE OTHER BABY BATH TUBS ARE SO BIG AND BULKY. IT ALSO IS VERY STURDY.,5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"This is OK for the short time that I am actually going to use it because it does get the job done.  However:-it does not hold a lot of water, so the water gets cool fast-the cusion is not that soft so I still have to put my hand under my babies headThe good news is:-it folds for easy storage-it has a little area for you to put the bathing items that you use such as some soap, wash cloth, or toys",2
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"This tub works fine.  It does not pose any safty hazard and is better than just puting baby straight into the tub, but be aware that it does have some problems.  Firstly, it is difficult to keep your baby (who cannot sit - which is the whole purpose of the tub) from drooping over to the side.  It also brags that it is a space saver, but to me that is like a bicycle advertising itself as a space saver simply because the basket on the handle bars is removable...in other words it is an exaggeration.  Lastly, after awhile, the bottom yellow pad starts peeling up and you can not get it to stick back down....I don't feel ripped off or anything, but I am having another baby now and replacing it with a better one.  This one won't even make it to the garage sale...it is going in the trash.",2
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I bought this tub because it  folded up. However, I hate it. It's hard to fill with water and there are trenchs on either side were my baby gets her foot stuck. The biggest problem I have is where the tub folds there is an open space that some how my baby keeps putting her hand in and getting scrapped.",1
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I bought this for size convienence. While its folding feature is very useful, I had to buy a bath sponge to put under my son because the foam liner was NOT slip resistant. My son slides all over. It did fit in my sink well, though, and the drain plug is useful. My son is 6mos and 25 inches and is about to grow out of it, but the tub does say 0-6 mos, so I guess it's time for a bath seat. I guess if you decide to purchase it, get a bath pad too!",3
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,We bought this tub for our first child and it was great. We used it first on the counter and then later in the big tub so that our son would be used to the running water sound (which can be scary to a young child). It is so compact and easy to store. I didn't want a bulky tub to try to store when I wasn't using it in our apartment. I kept this bath and will be using it with our next child we are expecting in a few months! I think this is a great buy and very well priced. Face it you will only be using this for a few months until your child can sit up on his/her own so spending a bunch on a fancy tub just doesn't make sense. =),5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,We are ""apartment dwellers"" and the idea of this tub folding up really attracted us to this product.  It IS very compact and fit nicely into a nook in our tiny bathroom.  Buy it does tend to leak at the hinges; I recommend using it inside the sink and not on a counter-top.  It also is very shallow.  It was perfect for those very first baths when you don't want too much water in the tub or possibly for a child who does not like baths.  But my son is a bath lover and before he was even 6 weeks old we'd replaced it with a deeper tub to allow him to stay warmer and also to splash around more.  If I could do it again I'd save my money (every little bit counts for us!) and just buy a bigger tub to begin with.,2
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,This is a great tun for the price.  I used for my son until he was about 10 months old and thereafter he could sit up in the tub on his own.  It folds up very easily.  I found that using a body spong to line the bottom of this tub made it much easier to keep a slippery infant secure and comfortable.  I was not able to save this item to use with my next baby as the yellow lining inside the tub began to discolor but for the price this was an item that I did not mind throwing out after using it with only one baby.  This tub lacks the bells and whistles of more expensive ones but does the job and does it well.  I would buy this item again when I have another baby.,4
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I registered for the tub because storage is limited in my house.  My husband and I do not like this tub because if you fill it up too high the water spilled out of the sides where it folds up.  It also does not hold very much water.  Only my son's bottom is in the water.  His feet and hands are out of the water, so he cannot explore the water with them.  When he was younger his head always leaned to one side and ended up resting on the plastic side of the tub.  I was always worried that he would slip down.  I would recommend buying a different tub.",2
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I like this tub, it fits in my sink well, it folds up nicely. My daughter is 4 months old and still fits in it.",5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"We have used this tub for our daughter from birth to now (she is 6 months old). And she was 6 lbs, 14 oz at birth and now is 20 lbs (she's a big baby).  I don't understand the comments about it leaking at the hinges - it's not meant to be that full.  If it was that full it would be dangerous in that if the baby turned their head to the side it would be in the water!  The little reservoir is great at the end to keep ""clean"" water and the plug you can pull anytime is a must.  It fits down in our kitchen sink (and we have used it in other kitchen sinks when traveling - it has fit every one) and you can drain and refill during the bath.  We keep our little one warm by placing a wet, warm washcloth on her belly while we wash her hair (since this tub is in the sink and has the plug to pull - we leave the water running and can -re-warm her washcloth over and over) - a higher water level would be unsafe.  There is nothing I would change about this tub.  We'd keep using it except our daughter is sitting alone now and we think she's ready to play in the big tub.",5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I bought this tub for the convience.  I thought having a folding tub to store would be much easier.  My infant gets her feet caught in the sides of the tub and screams!  It hurts her poor feet.  Also she slides all over the place her head usually ends up propped up against the side which is not comfortable.  Also it does not hold much water so you end up having to dump water out just to have enough room to rinse her off and she stays cold the whole time.I would imagine it would not work well for older babies either, it is almost too small for her and she is only 10 lbs.  I hope this helps someone!",1
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"We first saw this fold-up infant tub in the NICU unit where our baby stayed for her first 4 weeks.  Its ability to be easily stored was a big plus in the hospital, as well as at home.  The NICU nurse recommended that we line any infant tub with one of those baby bath sponges (ours is yellow and in the shape of a bear).  We use our tub in the kitchen sink.  Leaks, pinches and mildew have never been a problem.  Oddly enough, we have found that our baby likes to sit in the tub backwards (once she could hold up her head).  This positon is more upright and also makes it easier to wash her hair.  We use the kitchen sprayer on low and place a washcloth over our baby's torso which we frequently re-wet with warm water to keep her from getting cold.  Our baby is still a bit small for 4 months, but we anticipate that this tub will work for several more months.  Our baby loves bath time!- Our baby is now 8 months old and about 16 pounds.  We have used this infant tub up until this point and are just now graduating to the big tub.  This fold-up tub was a great purchase for us!",5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"This tub was an excellent purchase for our family. It folds up easily and neatly for a quick trip to grandma's house or for storage.One thing I recommend is purchasing a baby contoured body sponge to lay inside the tub as the lining is neither soft nor slip proof (a thick towel would also do the job). We have one and it makes the entire bathing experience a joy as we don't have to worry about holding our son is a safe position while we bathe him. The tub folds and unfolds easily and has no problems leaking. We live a California so we don't worry about the tub not being deep enough to allow the water to cover our baby completely, but if you lived in a colder area I might think about purchasing another tub that can keep your baby covered by more warm water.",5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"because it folds up, it doesn't hold enough water to cover baby to keep him warm.  Nice portability however.",2
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I thought that this tub looked neat because it folded up for easy storage and it had a foam cushion already in it, plus the price was great! This was the worst purchase I have made.  My baby looked like she was &quot;folded&quot; when I put her in the bathtub and she slid sideways, because there arent any adjustments to the tub, so you can't raise it up and down.  I would advice anyone looking for a tub to just purchase a 3 in 1 tub.",1
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"There were definitely problems w/this tub. My baby's feet did get stuck in the hinges as others have mentioned. Also, if you try to put much water in it, it leaks. Try to shop around. Since my baby has gotten bigger, the little bather stands have worked best for us. This tub made us dread bath time.",2
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"This a great tub. fits in the sink great, I purchased a small sponge to lay her on so she would not slip. I love that if folds up saves space. Only problem is shes getting to big for it  My daughter loves her tub time !!!",5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"The good features of this tub:stores easily-takes up very little spacehas a nice sponge pad to reduce slippinghas a little holding area at baby's feet for soap, sponge, etc.Unfortunately, the bad features are pretty bad:maximum water level is only high enough to keep a 7-week-old's bottom wet (and warm) - the rest is all out of the waterit is not contoured from side to side, so baby slips and slouches diagonally in the tub, resting his head on one of the hinges.That said, we are using this tub again with the second child, but I think it will only be useful for a few weeks.  We are already placing it into the big tub and using it there, which erases any benefit to the parent of not having to bend over.If we had the space, I would definitely use a different tub.",2
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I love this thing, all the advantages of a full size bath with a special twist.  I live in a very small house and this was perfect for my needs.  It folds easily, the baby fits in the bath tub as if it was any other bath.  I do not see any pinching hazards due to it being a folding tub.  Mat is easily cleaned as it is not to porous.  Would recommend, especially if you have limited space.",5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"For new moms looking for a easy, compact tub..this is the one!I've used this tub for my daughter since she was 2 weeks old.  As she got older I put this tub right in our larger tub and it fills and drains easy.  It's easy to clean, folds easy and you can store it right in the closet.  After each bath I would leave it out to dry and then folded it up and stored it away, it NEVER got mildew or smelled.  My daughter is now 7 months old and has out grown this tub but I have to say it's the best one yet!",5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I have used this tub since I brought my newborn home fromthe hospital.  He loves getting a bath.  This tub keeps the water below his waist, for less chance of drowning as long as I am right there.  It also has a plug that I can let water out if neede, in case it is too full.  It has a rubber center that keeps baby from slipping and causing injury.  This tub folds up really nicely and I can fit it under my sink to keep it out of the way.  So, it is handy, safe, and convenient.",5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,this tub it totally uncomfortable and poorly made.  safety first needs to get their act together because a lot of their products lately are poorly made!,1
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"This is the first review I have bothered to write because I feel so strongly on this item.I will be looking for another bather asap. I have used this one twice. The first time I didn't know the water would leak out the hinges on all 4 sides so I had water all over my countertop while my baby was just put in. It was difficult to try to catch the water and hold onto a screaming newborn. Plus I had to use her towel to sop up the water. Good thing Daddy was around to bring me another towel for her. The second time I used it I was aware that it leaked, but I still managed to have it overflow and water leak when the baby was put in. This leak factor would be ok if you were planning on putting the bather in the bathtub, but otherwise it makes a mess.Also, the water is so shallow that she shivered the entire time. If it is shallow when she is 3 weeks old, it will really be shallow when she is bigger. Don't recommend at all.",1
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I was given this tub, and am not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, but it is terrible.  The plastic edges where the tub folds stick out and poke my little one in the temples when he slides sideways.  He is always slipping down lower, and lower as I attempt to bathe him. The whole process quickly becomes an ordeal.  I was a nanny all through college and never had these problems with the other tubs.  I really don't like it.",1
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I would highly recommend this tub to any new parent.  My daughter has been taking her baths in this since she was born (now six months) and only now will I begin to start her in the ""adult"" tub in a bathing seat.This tub is safe - padding helps to keep baby in place, of course you have to hold her 100% of the time! Isn't this common sense?This tub is easy to clean.  Rinse off and wipe it down -- I am done with clean up in minutes.This tub is convenient.  It folds up and stores under your sink, in a cabinet, wherever.  Out of sight!!!This tub is reasonably priced.  Because you will only use it for a short time (they'll outgrow it by six months) you don't have to spend a lot for its great features.I highly recommend it to all!!!",5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"I bought this tub about 6 years ago for my first child and am now using it for our newest addition and I have not experienced any problems. As far as the water going over the sides, which it does do that, I keep the water running in the tub and keep the bottom portion under the running water so the water around the baby is always warm. My children were and are small babies so outgrowing the tub early has not been a problem. My first daughter was sitting on her own by 2 1/2 months but she still loved sitting in this tub and playing. Though not perfect, but what is these days, I would still recommend it.",4
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"My mom got this tub for my daughter right after she was born.  We have used it since she was able to take a bath, and she's 4 months old.  I liked that it could be folded, but I never actually put it away unless we have company since I use it daily.  It does leak at the hinges.  My daughter is very comfortable in it.  Since she was born in the winter, I gave her a bath in the bathroom so that I could get it really warm.  It does fit in the kitchen sink though.  I still give her her bath in the bathroom, and just sit her tub in the big tub.  It uses less water, her head is elevated, and she's a little higher.  She hasn't outgrown it yet, and has plenty of room. It is a great tub, and a great price!",4
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"We bought this tub because the cloth one we had before got a musty smell to it if you didn't machiene wash it after every bath.  We liked the ease of cleaning this tub, and how it folds up to store nicely.  I didn't experience any problems with leaking, (only with splashing, as my daughter likes to waive her arms in the tub).  On the downside, my daughter is only 8 weeks old and 24 inches long.. her legs drape up and over the tub and her feet are FREEZING during bathtime eventhough we keep a heater blowing on us the whole time. As she has gotten stronger, she will bend her knees and get her legs inside the tub where she quickly pushes off the upslope and nealy catapolts herself from the tub.  She has more than once ended up hitting the hard plastic sides with her face when she turns her head to look around, despite the fact that I always have a hand on her.I guess, bottom line the tub is OK for the money and for small, lethargic babies with genetically warm feet.",3
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,I have been using this tub since my baby's first bath.  He is 5 months old now and we still use this tub all the time. This is very useful.  My son also like this tub very much.  He is very comfortable with this tub. The only problem I faced is that the water leaks in seams.  You should be careful about that.  Otherwise this tub is very comfortable.,4
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,Our baby boy seems to love this tub. It fits fine in our double sink and the baby seems quite comfortable.  I do wish it held a little more water but how much water does a 2 month old need! This is a great tub for the money.,4
Floating Bath Pal Baby Bath Thermometer,"I have purchased this item multiple times for all of my friends expecting a little one. The baby thermometer works wonders when a little one progress from using a baby bathtub to being alone in the big bath tub. I was always afraid of giving a little one a bath in hot water and I was always giving my little one a cold bath. With this thermometer, I never have to worry about the temperature of the bath water again. The kids love it as well. It is very durable and the kids love to play with it.The way it works is by dunking the thermometer in the water for a few seconds. As long as you see green numbers on the thermometer, the water is good. If the number is blue, it is either regressing or progressing and you need to adjust the temperature as needed. All of my friends love it.",5
Stroller Rain Cover,"I bought this rain shield after reading another review that said it fits Peg Perego strollers. Since we live in NYC, it is an absolute essential! We had a Prince Lionheart Rain Shield but left it behind on a trip.The quality of this shield is excellent; durable, heavy plastic, nice side vents, etc.The major flaw is that it does not hang down far enough in the front, and when we were out with it last, my 17 month old's feet were drenched because the shield left them exposed. He is of average height but since he will obviously grow before he is totally out of the stroller, this shield is useless to us. (I will save it for any future babies, when we are using the carseat/stroller combo).I am really disappointed and will have to buy another shield.",2
Stroller Rain Cover,I had this on my baby list as it claims it fits over most strollers. I too have the Peg Perego Pliko stroller and last week I tried using it for the first time. Hah! I spent 20 minutes in the wind trying to get the darn thing to stay put. There are no straps or snaps or anything to keep it over the stroller and it kept blowing off like an inflatable balloon! I spent more time chasing it across the parking lot than anything else. Gave up and will be returning it. When I was in the UK they sold a Peg Perego rain cover that first over the Pliko perfectly. Where can I get one here?? Don't waste your money if you have a Peg Perego!,1
Stroller Rain Cover,"Living in the city, our only form of entertainment outside is really to just take a stroll, and this cover really helps, especially on those sunny but windy days.  I do agree with others that it's a pain to fold up, but it is do-able.  You just have to keep the creases there (from when you first open the package), but folding it the same way (like a paper bag)...then it'll come out somewhat flat.It's also nice that it fits over the stroller even with the car seat snapped in.",4
Stroller Rain Cover,"My hubsand and I just moved to England on a military duty tour , and the weather is crazy. But the rain cover was great it fitted very good on the stroller , and it even fit on the baby jogger . Love it",5
Graco Traveling Potty Seat,"I was a little worried about pinching after reading reviews, but I ALSO read the reviews about how to use it and that helped so much. It works like a charm. I like having it because DD's little bum would just fall into the bowl w/o it. I bring it aling everywhere so we don't have to worry about if someone has a potty seat or not.",4
Graco Traveling Potty Seat,"We're currently in the process of potty training our 2 yr old daughter, and we travel a bit.  I saw this and thought it a great idea!  Only problem is, if the seat isn't EXACTLY on right, it can slide off of some hotel toilets.  Doesn't work to well on the extra large (oblong) toilets because the back part isn't supported by the normal toilet seat, but it does help.  And you do know its clean and you know where its been, so when lil one puts her hands on it to help support herself, you don't have to worry about what shes acutally picking up. Travels well in a diaper bag, purse, or the back of a stroller.",4
Graco Traveling Potty Seat,My sister gave me her's for my now 6-year-old daughter.  It was great!  I can't find it and am going to purchase a new one for my 2-year-old son who is now potty trained!!!!  I hate to rely on the paper seats for protection.  This is much better and YOU KNOW it's clean.,4
Graco Traveling Potty Seat,"This is a wonderful way for your boy or girl to stay clean and comfortable using the potty when away from home.  It is foldable which makes it easy to carry in a purse; it is comfortable and stable on the toilet which reinforces the child that it is safe to sit freely.  Don't be worried about catching your child's skin on the fold ends, it does not.  A convenient plastic zipper bag is sold with it too.  Enjoy!",5
Graco Traveling Potty Seat,"If your child is too little to slide all the way back or you can't stand the thought of them touching the a public restroom, then this 'might' work. But, this thing fell in the stupid toilets more times than I care to remember and that is less sanitary. If I'm going somewhere where it's easy for me to take the regular potty ring [not foldable] I do that. Otherwise, I use wipes and toilet paper and save myself the trouble.",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I was given this tub at my baby shower. At first it seemed to be a great gift because it would work until my daughter was a toddler. Well, it didn't turn out that way. The tub leaks water from the bottom even if you follow the directions on how to put it together. I didn't realize it was leaking until there was a huge puddle on my bathroom counter. Another drawback is that it is so big that I can't get it to drain into my bathroom sink if it is sitting on the counter...so I have to carry it over to the tub to drain. ANY time I have lifted it in order to drain it in the tub, when it was supposed to be locked together...it ALWAYS came apart and water poured out all over the bathroom floor. I had to mop this up three times before I finally decided to give it up and get a new tub.Another thing that was extremely annoying is that my daughter would slide down the net sling everytime which meant I had to constantly pick her up and readjust her...not easy with a wet slippery baby!I HATE THIS TUB!!! I just bought a new tub (FOR LESS MONEY) that is GREAT! It has a sling that goes all the way across the top of the tub so she doesn't slip at all. Now she likes bathtime..and so do I.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I have used this tub for two years, but that is only because I've been too busy to figure out another solution.  This tub is meant to sit within the ""real"" bathtub, so be aware of that before you buy it.  Yes, it's likely to leak if you try to move it full of water, so it doesn't work well on a countertop or on the floor.  The sling-type thing for use with newborns I found to work well.  Likewise, the blue part for use with older babies that can sit up also worked well.  But my major issue with this tub is all the cracks and crevices that are impossible to clean.  Mildew thrives in them, and if you manage to take the tub apart once in awhile (a huge project), you will see disgusting gunk in the areas that don't get air.  I do still like the idea of bathing my now toddler in a smaller tub within the main tub (uses less water and easier to clean, in theory), so I will be looking for a seamless very plain tub to replace this one.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,Don't even think about buying this bath tub!!!! It leaks!!!Absolute junk!!!!,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,The 4-in 1 bath tub leaked on several occassions during set up and with baby inside it.  We could only use it in the shower because it leaked when placed on counter tops or table.  The bottom is sharp against babies back when laying inside it.  The suction cups on the bottom were difficult to work with.  I regret buying this product.,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I have absolutly LOVED this tub!! We got it befor our first son was born, he is now 13 months and we still use it.  We are expecting our second child soon, and I have no intention of buying any other tub.  We had the same problem as many others, with the leaking, but once we made sure the tub was fully extended there were no other problems.  The sling worked beautifully until our son could sit on his own, and now we use the green bar.  I worked as a nanny for over 10 years befor I got pregnant and I have never seen a better tub!  I also have two slipped discs in my lower back...and now a HUGE belly, this product allows you to bath your child on a counter top or table top for and much longer time period than the others...this as allowed me to refrane from having to bend over during bath time, making this tub a life/back saver!!!  It was also wonderful because I could use this tub right away for sponge baths and still had no need to bend over which made post c-section healing much easier, and sponge baths less messy.  I HIGHLY recomend this product!!",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I like this tub.  I have a premature daughter and I used the sling at first in the sink and gave her baths on it.  She is now 5 months and I have been using the tub and sling for a couple months when she got big enough for it.  She stays supported fine in the tub.  Her arms fall down where the sling isn't plush against the tub...that is the only problem I have with it.  She hasn't hurt herself though.  I think the tub is great.,4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I'm shocked by all of the other reviews on this particular product.  Many complain that it's too small for their sink...hello!!!  It wasn't made for a SINK.  Anyway,...I love this tub.  I wouldn't want any other one.  It was the most convenient when my son needed to be on the sling =perfect=, and now that he's sitting up,... it's even more convenient.  Please ignore the negative reviews and I highly consider buying this product.  It may be the only tub you will buy in you child' early stages.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I think this tub is great!  I got if for a shower gift about two years ago.  When my husband first put it together it leaked, but it hadn't been put together correctly.  My son is almost two and we are still using it, and we have had no problems.  I strongly recommend this product.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I haven't had problems with this tub.... I used another tub for my son for the first 3 months, and that tub became too small, so I purchased this one.  I'm so glad I did.At 3 months, my son was large for his age, but unable to sit up yet, so this tub was perfect.I've given it 4 stars instead of 5 because I agree with the other comments that it is not easily collapsible to store, and it is bulky, but we simply let it dry in the bathroom overnight and store it under his crib during the day - so space turned out to not be so much of a problem.I have had no issues with the tub leaking though.  Once it is completely extended, there is a good seal and it does not leak.I have and will continue to recommend this tub to all my friends.It's accomodating for longer than any tub out there.well worth the money.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,We received this tub as a shower gift. I was very pleased with it until I realized that it was leaking!  We wanted to return it purchase one of the many better made tubs out there but we threw away the box. I now give him baths in the kitchen sink. I would not recommend this product.,3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I thought this bathtub would be the perfect solution for our small house.  With only one bathroom and little storage space it looked like it would easily collapse and expand to fit in the cabinet.  Even though I am a fairly strong woman I found the buttons difficult to depress and the tabs on the bottom nearly impossible.  The tub will leak if the bottom tabs are not correctly pressed into place. Unless my husband is available to assemble and disassemble the bath I have to use it directly in the bathtub.  Hunching over the edge of the tub is uncomfortable to say the least.  When collapsed the bathtub is still a monster, taking up almost an entire cabinet in the bathroom.  However, this tub is better than a non-collapsible tub for tight living areas as it is possible, if difficult, to put it away out of site.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I bought this for a baby shower. The mother-to-be was enthusiastic about her gift.,4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I love this tub.  I think it was a great idea.  This works as a wonderful transition from a baby tub to the adult tub.  I bought it when my son was starting to sit, I didn't have to worry about a bath seats suctions not working and my son tipping over. Also I know it is hard to get older babies in and out of a regular bath seat without scraping knees. This bath seats clips on so I put him in the bathtub first, then just clip the seat on around him.  He can sit in the tub and play with his toys keeping everything within arms reach of him.  Its much better than filling an entire tub for such a little person.  It does leak a little, but I just put it in our tub so it doesn't matter.  This is a good idea anyway to get them used to the adult tub for when they do eventually have to use it.  I am not sure I would want it for a small infant.  I never used the sling/hammock thing.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This tub is really just not worth it.  Even if some people have had good experiences, look at how many haven't.  There are better tubs on the market -- affordable too.The sling is alright - we use it in the regular bathtub.The bathtub itself is awful - it leaks everywhere.  It would be nice if it didn't leak but it does.  I had seen the review on here where someone mentioned that maybe the tub wasn't snapped or locked in well -- this one was and it still leaked.Honestly - just look elsewhere - the headaches aren't worth it - looks like you have a 25% chance of getting the one tub that won't leak.  Ours is in the trash.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I think the 4-in-1 bathtub is the greatest. I originally put it on my registry because it looked good but I am happy to say it works wonderfully. I love the insert that allows the baby to lay back and still have easy access to wash his back. I also like the fact that it changes as your baby changes. The only drawback is that the place where you put the ring for the bath seat is a little difficult to clean, but cotton swabs work great. This is trully a must have for new moms.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I bought this without reading the reviews.  The tub definately leaks a little bit, I suppose because they try to make it adjustable.  Because it leaked I bought a different tub.  In the end I went back to this one because it has the bath ring.  I feel much better knowing the baby isn't going to slip under the water. My daughter is 9 months now and she loves this tub.  What I did to resolve the leak issue was put a boot tray under it.  It fits perfectly and catches any water that gets by.  Great $5 fix for an otherwise terrific tub.  Hope this helps.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I was really excited about this tub, thinking it would fullfil all of our needs- I was wrong! We tried using the tub sling in our sink when my son was about 4 weeks old. He would slide right off of it. It was more work having it in the sink than to just go without. Now as for the tub itself- I tried, my husband tried, as well as several other relatives, and if there is a way to use it without it leaking water....we couldn't figure it out!! Lastly, the amount of effort it took to pull the bath to full size, or to push it together for storage was more trouble than anyone would want to mess with. If you decide to give this tub a try, keep the box! We just ended up throwing ours away and buying a new tub.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I bought this tub and am not impressed at all. Here are my top 3 complaints:1) Permanant thumb nail damage in putting the &$*$ thing together.2) Despite draining the tub, hanging it upside down and letting it dry, it still stays moist in spots and is a mold trap.3) Suction cups work VERY good and make for a real you know what to get the tub up.Probably the best part is the slanted infant mesh angle seat. That I use by it's self in our big tub. Don't waste your money.And one more thing, if you haven't broken all of your fingernails, this tub will leak until your husband snaps it like Hulk Hogan.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This tub is very hard to set up and I had to try a few times. The instructions given were lousy, I almost clipped my own fingers in between the moveable part while trying to slide it open fullsize.The base of this tub is also uneven, I'm not sure if it's 'friendly' to newborns as it could scratch the baby's skin. The fabric slide is also flimsy when set up at the edge of the tub, it moves!  This slide DOES NOT snap on as claimed, it simply just sits at the edge of the tub.. don't be fooled.Overall, I think if you have to use this tub, it may be better for a toddler since it has the bath ring.For newborns, this tub may not be suitable.  I'm stuck with it and I don't even want to give it away as a gift because I don't think it's an ideal product.  I am thinking of getting another tub when my new baby arrives.Although the tub itself is 'Made in US', the plastic quality is poor.  The slide is 'Made in China' and the quality is acceptable.If you have a choice, don't buy this.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I quit using this tub after the first two months. Count me in the group who wishes they had read these reviews before buying...It leaked every time we used it - and we followed the instructions to the letter. I gave up and put the tub on a towel to soak up all the leaking water...It was also uncomfortable for our daughter if she wasn't in the sling. The design doesn't seem to be logical - all these tough plastic bits digging into the baby when they sit in the tub. We gave up and put it in the basement (where it's collecting dust) and bought a new tub.This tub is a waste of money. Don't bother with this product, there are much better options out there.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This tub was a big disappointment. It leaked the first time we used it. We ended up buying a simple one-piece tub. The two-piece design sounded like a good idea, but it was almost impossible to engage the locking tabs, and the gasket didn't hold up.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We got this tub as a gift before our baby was born.  We had put it on our registry and were thrilled to receive it.  The sling worked great in the kitchen sink for the 1st 3 weeks and then we moved to using the sling inside the baby tub in our bathtub which worked great for about a month.  Now we have scrapped the tub altogether and Mommy takes a bath with baby.  Our daughter is long for her age and by the time she was 4 months old she was banging her legs, feet and knees on the baby tub.  We tried moving onto the sitting position with the safety bar in front of her, but it was impossible to clean all of her in this position.  We never had trouble with leaks however as some have complained.  Overall, skip this and go with an inexpensive newborn sling for the first few weeks/months according to your baby's size and then opt for a non-skid bottomed bath (one of those foam thingies that baby can sit on without skidding around-they cost around $6) for baby to recline in if you don't want to bathe with your baby.  We find that if Mommy bathes with her, she gets all of her crooks and crevices much cleaner and has a blast also.  In a month or so she'll be stable enough to sit without slipping and won't need Mommy's support.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"Terrible tub! We mistakenly used twice and it leaked both times...not from the center where it takes muscles to push it down to snap properly, but leaky on the sides...and then the suction cups stuck it to the counter and water went everywhere!!! I'm going to still try to return it ASAP!",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I liked the idea behind this product. It grows with the child which is neat. The sling is wonderful for newborns because you can use it in the tub or in the sink for really little ones. The only problem is that I don't really see how it will in fact grow with the child. My son is 3 months now and he's 24 inches. He's starting to fit awkwardly in the tub already. I guess it may work once he's old enough to sit up in the ring. The other problem I had with it is that it can't travel with you. It's way too bulky so you can only use it at home. It folds compactly at home but not enough to want to lug it around with you. Overall though, I really do like this tub. It's only $20 and you definitely get your money's worth.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"My daughter weighed only 4lbs when she was born, so this tub with the sling option saved me.  She was to tiny to be in the sink for a bath and this tub was just what I needed.  She enjoyed every bath in the 4-in-1 tub, the sling was perfect, then she graduated to the ring to help her sit still, and then the tub by itself she enjoys so very much. Once this tub was open and all the locks snapped in place we just lifted up the suction cups and placed it against the side of the tub to dry for her next bath.  No leaks, no problems, EVER!!",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We bought this bathtub with the thought in mind - it compacts down for easy storage.  I love the size of the tub, the built in tub ring and the sling that came with it was very helpful.  The price was very reasonable too.  The only thing I didn't care for is that it was not very easy to snap together and  fold it in.  We finally just left it extended.  Other than that, it is a great product.",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I too had a really tough time expanding this tub and would not want to collapse &amp; extend this thing for every bath so it stays open. When open, it is too big to put in the sink and I don;t have much counter space. When carrying a full tub across the kitchen to the table, it leaks all over the floor. I have to pull the table over near the sink and use the sprayer to fill the tub. Terrible. Stick to the regular tubs that have been doing the job for years!",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This was a fantastic tub for us.  We used the sling over the sink in the bathroom for the first two months (we put one end on the countertop and the other in the sink so it was mostly flat).  This was great for me to bathe my baby since I had a c-section and no desire to bend over the side of the tub.  After that, we used the sling in the baby tub in a real bathtub.  Why use it outside of one?  It is really easy to fill, empty and rinse out when in a real tub, plus it gets your child used to being in the big bathtub.  We just set the sling in the bottom of the tub and didn't prop it up like the photos show.  No slidey baby that way.  My daughter used it until she was almost 13 months old.  I'd definitely buy it again.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"The Tub leaks from the bottom, sometimes in a gush and sometimes in a slow leak.  If left for an hour or so while going to put the baby to sleep, you will come back to find and empty tub and a very wet floor.By the second week the support sling had a funny odor from getting wet no matter how I cleaned it.  AND the suction cups stuck to my tub so hard they left marks!NOT A GOOD TUB AT ALL!",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I too have a problem with the sling...actually, I have 2 problems.  The sling won't stay in place....it snaps in before we start the bath but starts sliding around.  My second problem is that the sling is slippery.  My son just slides down. One time he slid so quickly that his back hit the grooves that the toddler ring snap into and it left a bruise on his back! I have to place a washcloth over the area to keep him from getting bruised again. I still use this tub because I refuse to spend any more money on an item that is only used for a few months but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This is a good size tub, but it leaks when you move it. What bothers me the most is that, when it leaks, my poor baby starts to cry because she's cold! All of a sudden her warm bath turns into a nightmare. I have to crap her up and refill the tub again, now this is where it becomes FRUSTRATING... Bath time, in and of itself, is a lot of work, and to add a leaking tub, that just draws the line. Hope this helps!",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I received this bath as a shower gift (I had registered for it).  I used the tub for my daughter from the very beginning.  The sling was perfect to wash her for it let her lay back and not get water in her face when washing her hair.  I read in one review that the cloth on the sling got smelly.  Well, you have to take it off and wash it.  It does have that ability.  I used this tub until my daughter turned one.  I loved the tub and I still have it and will use it again if I have anymore children.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"All in all, I have been very satisfied with this tub.  While it has leaked a couple of times, the reason was that we put too much water in it--if you don't fill it too high, leakage is not a problem.  We have used it since our daughter was one week old, and the snap in sling feature made bathing so easy.  We keep it on the counter between our two bathroom sinks--it fits perfectly, and drains right into one of the sinks.  Our daughter is now a year old, but we still have the sling in it--it makes rinsing her off a snap.  We don't use the ring--it hasn't been necessary, she just sits up on the sling.  Now that she is trying to stand and twist and turn, I will probably move it into the bathtub, where I hope to get another year out of it. We do keep it open, and store it under the sink.  I agree that the snap feature is a bit difficult to use.  But I would buy it again.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"My son (3.5 months) wiggles around so much I'm afraid the sling is going to shoot right out from under him.  He pushes his heels into the bottom of the tub and pushes backwards.  This tub might be alright for an older baby, but if you have a wild one like mine, then you might want to pass.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This worked well when my daughter was smaller and had to lay on the sling. It did leak, I always had to place a towel under it.I changed it to the sitting position last night since she is now a good sitter. She ended up with bruises on her knees. The blue plastic piece is not soft so with her kicking scratched her and bruised her.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I bought it for my newborn and I hate it!!  Even after reading the instructions it worked ok for about a week and then it started to leak. Do yourself a favor and purchase different one.,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,this tub is so annoying. i followed the instructions but the tub still leaked!!!,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"Please do not buy this bath tub! As the other reviews have said, it is a leaky mess! Even with the tabs closed it still leaks! I have to put a few towels under it so that the counter doesn't flood! I am online now to find a new one. If you have received this as a gift, as we did, return it! Hopefully Safety First will read these reviews and take this product off the shelf!",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This tub does not really take you through four stages.  I received it as a shower gift, and started using it right away.  The sling by itself was OK for stage one, but it doesn't fit comfortably or safely in the tub.  Once you have the tub open, it leaks!!!  Just don't waste your money; look elsewhere.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"Don't waste your money buying this tub.  First of all, it was impossible locking the tabs in place.  I had to wait for my husband to come home to put it together, and even he had a difficult time with it.  So if you think that the collapsable feature is a good idea, you're wrong.  Secondly, when I filled the tub with water and picked it up, it leaked all over my floor.  I was so upset that I called Safety 1st.  They told me that the tub was not meant to be picked up and that the directions enclosed told me so.  I argued with them about this and demanded my money back.  It wasn't until that I demanded to speak to the manager that they told me they would refund my money only if I return the suction cups, the plug, and my receipt.  They said that they would send me a letter in the mail and after I receive the letter I needed to mail in the items.  It's been two weeks and I still haven't received this so-called letter.  I am never going to buy a Safety 1st item again because their customer service is terrible.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"For a first time mom, this was great,  for a newborn baby I would recommend using the slope in a sink that is  a better level for your back.  But for a few month old baby the slope in the bath is great, she was able to lie there and kick and splash and enjoy herself.The only set back that this has is that because it can be stored (one side fits into the other side) smaller it has two separate levels,  the thing with this is that the slope goes over the deeper part and you have to fill the tub up with more water to get to the higher end.  Which means that you have to use that much more water inorder to get a good depth.  In my opinion this feature would be better if the slope was over the higher end of the tub.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I have 3 boys.  Two of them are twins.  I received the bath for my 1st son's baby shower.  It is great.  When they were just infants up to 3 months old, I took the sling and put it in the sink.  After 3 months I put the sling into the bath, inside my bath, so I didn't have to worry about water spills.  When they were able to sit I took the sling out and adjusted the ring for them to sit.  When they were able to sit on their own I removed the ring.  As a bonus I was able to put my twins in there at the same time.  All the while I left the tub inside my big tub.  It helps to get them used to being in that area and to see the water come out of the faucet to fill up their tub.  The only thing I found was there was always a little water left in the tub after I drained it.  I would flip it over and leave it to dry.  I have no complaints about this tub what so ever.  My kids all loved it.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,This tub is ridiculous!  My son is barely 4 months old and he can't even fit in it lengthwise!  We can't adjust it to the sitting position though because he's not that great at balancing his upper torso.  So what gives?  We bought a tub that he's already outgrown (even though he's still a newborn) but can't use any of the other positions yet?  What a piece of crap.,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We received this tub as a shower gift and started using it after our son's cord fell off. It worked GREAT for the first few months, but recently it has started to leak, and leak BAD! I fill it up with water, take my son's diaper off and get him to the bathroom, only to find that the tub is already almost empty. VERY disappointing.Also, the sling does NOT lock into place. It doesn't fit where it's supposed to. My son also slides down the sling all the time.My husband put the tub together and did it EXACTLY as it said to do, so the reviewer who said that it doesn't leak if you put it together right is wrong.We went out and bought a different tub today. Hopefully, we'll have better luck with the new one.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This tub sounds great on the box but not worth the effort.  LEAKS LEAKS LEAKS!!!  I received this tub as a shower gift and was truly excited.  When my daughter was able to be submerged I filled it up, left the room to undress her and came back to an empty tub.  To this day it will not hold water for more than 10 minutes. My bathtub fills with more water than this baby bath when I'm trying to fill it for my daughter's tub. Buy the cheaper non-collapsable tub and forget about this one.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I originally bought the Euro bath as it was rated highly in the Baby bargains book.  However, once our baby was big enough to use it, she kept sliding down and it looked VERY uncomfortable.  I tried putting a towel under her and behind her back, but it was just very frustrating.  I then bought the tubside bath seat, but didn't like that either.  The seat sits well over an inch above the bottom of the tub, so you need to use quite a bit of water to get it up to her legs.  I know you aren't supposed to use a lot of water, by my little girl likes to kick her legs and splash.  So, I finally bought the 4 in 1 tub.  I wish I had gotten it from infancy.  It has a sling to use when the baby is really tiny, then when your baby can sit, the blue piece spins around so your baby is supported in a circle.  Our baby is almost 10 months and I am just about ready to turn the blue piece so she doesn't have it in front of her anymore.  Once she is too big for that, we can then move into the Euro bath and hopefully get a few years out of that.  Why use a ton of water when you can fill one of these tubs instead.  Plus I just feel more comfortable having our baby in more of a confined space.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I absolutely love this bathtub.  I used the sling when my daughter couldn't sit up and now she sits in the ring part of the tub.  It is a perfect size for an infant.  My daughter is 8 months old and I think she'll be able to use this tub for a few more months.,5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I bought this tub for my son before he was born and when i started using it i realized that it doesnt hold water.  I hoave to leave the tap on just to keep the tub filled.  Im glad that when I bathe my son I put this leaky tub into the bath tub.  I found that if you stuff a wash cloth in the bottom where the two pieces meet it hold in the water for the most part.  I wish I would have researched it more.  My husband and I thought it would be great so we could have our son grow into it.  Boy were we wrong!!!,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I bought this tub as an exchange for a duplicate gift that I had received.  I have used it since birth, first on the kitchen counter and later inside the bath-tub.  The first time we opened it to use, it was confusing and very hard to push the secure tabs into place on the back to avoid leaking.  I never close it for storage since it is such a pain to open and close.  I liked the sling and never had a problem with it.  My biggest complaint is that it has so many corners and crevices that are impossible to keep clean. I think a better design would be to have more smooth surfaces to make it easier to clean, and forget the storage feature.",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I found this one item to be an amazing value for the money.  The sling was helpful in the early weeks of my daughter's life for baths in the sink.  After she was old enough for baths in the tub we put this tub up on our kitchen counter for easy access - the sling worked great in the tub too.She used the bathring until about 18 months and then just the tub alone until recently. My daughter is 22 months and she just started taking baths in our bathtub instead of in this tub.  We never had any problems with it - and we loved the fact that it helped save water (important to us here in the SW) by not having to fill a big bathtub for just her.I would definitely recommend this product.,5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"My husband and I thought that this tub looked great in the store, so we bought it thinking that we were going to be pleased, and our son would be able to use it for awhile.  When we got home, I checked the reviews on it, and got a little discouraged, but we decided to give it the benefit of the doubt.  It was great for about the 1st 1 1/2 months.  It then started to leak, and I NEVER unlocked it making it smaller, we just kept it fully locked all the time.  I would run the water for my sons bath, and by the time I was ready to put him in it, half the water was gone. Also I noticed that the infant bath sling was rusting where it connected to the tub. I immediatly retured it to the store, and got a different one.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I bought this tub after my 2 1/2 month twin boys outgrew our sink.  I'm very disappointed with it since it really doesn't hold much water and it tends to leak from the bottom once the water has been in there for a short while.  Also, since you can't fill it up all the way, my boys would always be getting cold and that would spoil the entire bath time experience.  I got so fed up with this product that I decided to just take them into the shower with me!  They love it and it's much more time effecient.  All in all, I wouldn't waste the $20.00 on this.  Spend a little more and maybe you can get something better.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"At first I carried the tub into the nursery to bathe my son and it worked great for a while, but the first time I tried to carry it to the bathroom (rather than my husband) to empty it out it leaked all over and I had a mess to clean. Since then I have used it in the bathtub (with a bad back this is difficult). My son is only 3 months old and already he is getting almost too long to use it (of course he is a rather large 3-month old). For the time being he is doing OK in it, he likes to splash around. I think when he get old enough to just lay down in it I will have to invest in a new tub. The sitting position might be good, but it will definitely need a non-skid seat (which I'll have to add on).",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,We had this tub set up on our counter top to give our son his first bath.  We read the directions carefully while assembling it.  About 10 min of washing my son I realized there was water all over my counter leaking out from the bottom.  I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried it again being extra careful to do everything exact.  Same thing!!!!!  This Tub Is JUNK!,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"When my baby outgrew her newborn tub I shopped and looked at several baby tubs and I liked the ring on this tub.I do not have to hold the baby so she would not slide while been in the water. Also she would not be able to move too much or stand she is now 14 months old. I always wash my babys privates while she stands in the tub, then I sit her down. Let's face it the less they move around the less we work. It's difficult to open and close. Don't count on it. We also keep it open all the time and always make sure that it's locked on the bottom so it won't leak. This tub always leaks a little. It would of save us alot of time and water if they just made them one size.  But, after all.  I would not change it for any other. The ringis a time saver and keeps my baby in one place and is safe. Those other suction rings are not that safe.It's not that easy as they make it sound, but it's worth it.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,My husband and I both have problems getting this tub to latch!!  We live in a small apartment and thought that it would be convenient.  It takes up an entire shelf in our bathroom.  Our son is now old enough to sit up with the bar.  There's no tread on the bottom and our son continuously slides and can't sit up straight very well.  We've started putting a handtowel underneath him to give him a little extra help.  It's riduculous...I would NOT recommend this product to other parents.  Spend the extra money and get something more useful!,2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"Stay clear of this bathtub... I cleaned mine and in all of the crevises, MOLD had started top grow. The suction cups are so tight that if you fill up the tub and try to move it, you cannot lift it up. You have to take this tub apart every other day to keep it clean and safe for your child. My daughter also has a hard time laying on the mat. She keeps sliding down and I have to keep picking her back up. Buy a different bathtub for your child.........VERY DANGEROUS",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BATH. If you have bought the bath already look in the creases for bacteria that's growning. I didn't realize there was so much dirt and grim in my son's bath tub until I saw it floating one day and looked into all the cracks and was mortified.,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I took this bathtub back. I registered for it b/c of the space saving feature, but found that it is actually big and bulky. It is hard to snap together... It just isn't a good buy.  You are better off with the cheaper ones without the pinchable, snap together nonsense.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I absolutly loved this bathtub!!!  It was a little hard to get the tub to lock for me but my husband did it in about 5 seconds!  I have three kids and three different tubs for each and this is by far the best yet!  It is very hard to bathe a newborn but with this tub it is soooo much easier!  I highly recomend this tub!,4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I received this item as a gift for my baby shower and just started to use it a week ago. When I filled the tub up it leaked water all over my kitchen floor. My husband finally pushed the lock thing down but it still leaked. This product is not something I urge people to purchase.,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I was really happy when I recieved this tub as a gift for my shower.  I thought the 4-1 was a great concept.  When my son was ready for his first bath I placed it on the kitchen counter filled with water, but by the time I actually got him to the tub it had leaked and all of the water was on the kitchen floor.  What was supposed to be an enjoyable time fom me and my son ended up being a disaster with a cold screaming baby and a huge mess to clean up.  From then on we put the tub inside of our bathtub which was really hard on my back since I had to lean over the tub.  It was really hard to snap open and shut so we left the huge tub open the entire time that my son used it which made the compacting feature useless and annoying since that was why the tub was leaking in the first place.  I gave the tub two stars because the suction cups kept the tub from slipping around, plus the tub did grow with my son as it said it was going to do.  This product has a great concept but needs to be improved.  I would recommend a simpler tub for anyone who is looking.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I received this tub at my baby shower 13 months ago. I have had no problem at all with the tub, at first my daughter took her baths on the counter in the tub next to the sink, now at a year old she still takes them in this tub, but we put this little tub in our big tub! We never had any problem with leaks, and we always felt that she was safe in it. Especially when she was able to sit up by herself.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I registered for the tub and received it as a gift.  I was a little skeptical because of the bad reviews (but we needed something that would grow with our daughter since we do not have a tub - only a shower).I would recommend this tub to anyone.  It is easy to use and does NOT leak.  We have a small bathroom and it fits perfectly on the counter next to the sink.  The sling is at a perfect angle.  Our daughter loves bathtime.  We usually have to put a towel under the end of it because she splashes alot, but it has never leaked.It was relatively easy to put together - just make sure it clicks and you will have no problems.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I really like it even tho my son is only two weeks old and we really haven't had a chance to use this tub to its full potential yet.  My husband did want me to mention that the sling (as recommended for newborns) is WAY too big to fit into any sink.  No problem we kept it in the tub and attached the tub to the counter next to the sink.  Also my son keeps sliding down the sling.  Not only is there nothing to hold him in place, the sling is almost too slippery itself and he can end up in a heap at the bottom if one doesn't hang on tight enough.  Other than that, I really like it and have no complains as of yet.",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I can not believe they still sell this piece of junk!!! I recieved this almost exact same thing at my shower over 3 years ago!!!!  I doesn't hold water at all! I had to fill the entire tub in order to use it as a &quot;tub seat&quot;on top of that,  my son found it to be the most uncomfortable seat ever when he was 7 months old-all he did was cry in it!! Do yourself a favor, don't ever think of buying this-even for your worst enemy, it's that bad.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I really recommend another product - anything would be better.I couldn't get the bath to clip togther properly, my husband couldn't either - so we gave up. We just pushed it together and the water leaked out. My baby was small and he was very uncomfortable in it and slipped around alot.The only bit I finally used was the sling over my knees when we were both in the bath - and its use was limited. This is too gimicky - try a good old fashioned tub.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I first tried the sling in the sink, and that was useless.  It just wouldn't stay in place and made the entire process way more difficult than it had to be.  I then tried the sling attached to the tub. This time it stayed put, however my daughter didn't.  It provided very little support and she was constantly sliding down, I would pull her back up and down she would slide down again.  By the end of the bath her entire backside was red.  I then purchased a new tub.  But now that she is sitting up, I am back to this one, using it with the ring.  I am much happier with it now, plenty of room for her to play without having to fill the big tub. I have no problems with it leaking.  I take it in and out of the big tub everyday and have yet to have any problems.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"My little one is six months now and LOVES his bathtime. He giggles and splashes and feels very safe and comfortable in his little tub. I never used the sling in the sink. We went right into the little tub with the sling at first. We have never had any problems. I put his little tub in the normal, big tub and that works great. That way I can climb in the big tub, stay dry and be right by his side. I would definately recommend it to others.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I owned this tub with my first child and had to discard it when she grew out of it because it cracked. For my second child, I bought the First Years tub, which ended up being a total pain -- I threw it away and purchased this tub again.PROS -- I really like the sling for newborns. It can be used in this tub, as well as in your sink or large bathtub.  It's also easy to clean.-- The tummy rest is great once your child can sit up fairly well.  My babies both leaned their arms over the bar that goes across the middle and could enjoy splashing and playing with toys while I bathed them.  Having a good support like this makes it so much easier to keep a hold of them with one hand while grabbing shampoo, wash cloth, etc. with the other.-- It's great that the support can be removed for cleaning and for a last step tub before your child uses the big tub.CONS-- As other reviewers have said, it's a total pain to lock the center into place to keep it from leaking.  Once you've done it the first time, it's OK, but I was fooled and thought it had snapped (it was the side locks making that noise!) and it leaked all over my counter.  I don't understand why it's not just manufactured at the full size without this expansion thing -- it's not like it's that much smaller when it's not locked into place.-- The suction cups are very strong, and it can be difficult to empty the tub when it's on your counter.  You have to sort of pop up the back ones and then one of the front ones and scoot it over your sink.  It's a little tricky, but you get used to it.-- Because the suction cups are so strong, our first tub eventually got a hole in the bottom where cup pulled the entire plastic around it from the base of the tub (hence the need to throw it away after the first child).I have only one comparison, which is the one-star First Years tub, and I'd take this one over it any day.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This 4-in-1 Bath Station has been wonderful.  It's the perfect size for a newborn to toddler.  We have used the sling by itself by the sink for our daughter as a newborn.  We just used this method to sponge bath her and not worry about a newborn in a bath of water.  As she grew, we used the sling in the tub, then progressed with the various stages to help her sit up.  I never worried about her in the tub, though of course, I never left her alone either.  The tub grew with her through varies stages of development.  It was very helpful, and perfect to bathe her, no matter her age.  It is one of few items to use for a new child from the day she was brought home from the hospital to 3 years old!",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"It leaks every time I use it. It's impossible to snap back together if by some miracle you can change the size.  I have to put towels underneath the tub to collect all the water that leaks out of it.  I love the sling, but I am tempted to beat the tub with a hammer just to take out my frustrations with it.  If I could get down on the floor and bathe my son in the big tub with this tub inside, it would probably be easier (but I don't think my knees would appreciate it.  I received this as a gift and didn't check the reviews before using, I should have.  I am currently looking for another solution to this piece of junk.  Buy at your own risk.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We bought this tub for our newborn daughter.I don't recommend it because:- It leaks- When you are not using the ring, but are using the cloth, the bottom part where the ring will snap leaves a mark on baby.- With time, that same part where the ring will snap, in the bottom of the tub, gets dirty (even though we wash the tub very well after each bath). I had a hard time cleaning that part because a Q-tip didn't fit well.- You save just a little of storage space when the tub is folded.Now the details:Unlike other reviewers, I found it very useful for a newborn because my daughter fitted in the cloth and she seemed very comfy.At first I though the other reviewers didn't install the tub properly, because I didn't had any leaks.If I had wrote a review at that point, I would have given it 5 stars.But when my daughter was 6 months old, the leaks started.And when I put the ring in place: surprise!! The part in the bottom where the ring was snaped was very dirty. And I wash the tub immediatly after the bath, while my husband gets the baby dressed!I found this tub usefull the first 6 months, but now that we have the Eurobath, we know what a good tub means. It has to be durable, comfortable for baby, easy to clean and useful from birth to toodler.This tub doesn't meet those standards.Now we have the Eurobath, from Primmo. It is the best tub ever, even for a newborn.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I love the bath station. It has made bath time a breeze!! It was a bit difficult to get the bath adjusted, to prevent the water leaking out, but after that it was smooth sailing. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with a baby.I cant wait to transition as the baby grows.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I went through 3 bathtubs before finding this wonderful tub. It features 4 bathing options,4 suction tabs, and a drain plug. Most infant baths I came accross are chair shaped. I found that my daughter could not get fully immersed in the water and splash in these chair-shaped baths. The 4-in-1 Bath Station By Safety 1st is shaped like an ordinary basin and has 2 options for how the baby sits in it. It is deep enough for my daughter to experience floating and kicking sensations which she absolutely loves. As a tiny infant, I would lay her on the soft slope and hold her so that her body was mostly covered. She would kick her legs and let them float. Of course, you cannot take you hands off the baby while she is lying like this, but that's not a bad thing in that it keeps you right there and vigilant!Now that she is nearly 7 months old she sits up in the ring at the one end. The ring goes accross her middle and between her legs. This was absolutely magical for her. I cannot emphasize how much she loved it; leaning forward and reaching for her plastic bath toys and kicking her legs and arms up and down. She also learnt to hold onto the rail in front of her for balance. While you should never leave the room when bathing a baby; with the rail in this bath, you can take your hands off the baby and watch happily as she plays for as long as you will let her. She cannot fall backward or forward, and nor can she get her head under water.The bath also folds up. The two halves slide together so that it is half the size. I don't often do this though I can see that it would be useful! However because of the join in the middle of the bath, the two sides are different depths. This is no problem - only, I wish the deeper side were the side where the older baby sits in the ring, and the shallower side were the side you would put the slope for newborns. Not a big deal, just a suggestion!There is one downside is that once the bath is full, you cannot move it. If you do try to slide it forward or backward, all the water leaks out of it! So once it is filled, best to leave it where it is!I highly recommend this product which you can use for many many months right from birth. The best part of it is that its fun and this summer I'm going to take it outside and use it as a splash pool that she can sit up by herself in!",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We got it for our son at my baby shower, and the first time we used u it, it was great, it was not hard to use, and it did not leak, my son loved it too.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,my kids love this bath tub.  its safe for them and convienant for me.,5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"After buying the first years 4 stage bath tub and hating it..I bought this one. Although I have not used the newborn stage yet, my daughter loves sitting up in this tub. In turn, she loves bath time. I like that she is secure sitting up because of the bath ring. My tub does not leak and I like that it elongates to fit my growing baby. I think this turned out to be a good buy..so far.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"My mom bought this for us after she decided that the bath chair we already owned was not good enough.  This has been the best bathtub we could have ever wanted!  The newborn sling is nice, and lets baby have contact with the water without feeling overwhelmed.  Our baby didn't really like bath time until he could sit up by himself, and at that point this bath tub became a necessity.  Baby loves to explore the tub, and the secure bath ring helps keep him safely and securely in one place.  He is now almost 20 mos and we still use it with the bath ring in place because he likes it better that way, too!  I especially like it because I don't have to worry about him slipping under the water accidentally if I look away for a second to get his towel ready or something.  We had a problem with leaking at first, too, but once we read the instructions and pushed the bottom down securely, we haven't had a problem since.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,Because this tub expands there is a rubber strip to connect the two pieces once it is expanded.  The problem is after a while that stip will begin to ware out and not hold the bath water.  I do not recommend this one at all.  I am now having my second child and this is definetly not on my registery list.,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I had previously registered for another tub, though had to begin my research all over after my 6 month baby girl got her legs caught in the last tub.  This is an incredible tub..no leaking, great suction &amp; no rough parts to scrape our little angel.  We started using this tub when she was 6 month old so the first &amp; second stage of the tub I can not comment on..howver stage three is a delight for mother &amp; daughter...She loves her baths.  We keep it in our tub &amp; it works like a dream.  I highly reccommend this tub for new parents!!",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We found this tub was uncomfortable for our son. He always slid down the sling into the water and we had to constantly lift him back up into position. The sling is also hard and uncomfortable on their little bums. We went out and bought the Evenflo Comfort Tub and it is MUCH, MUCH better and cheaper too. The baby fits very snug and secure and bathtime has become a favorite with him since getting it. We say dump this tub and get the comfort tub designed to go right over your sink.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"Not sure why this got bad reviews.  There is a slight issue with locking the tub in the expanded position, if you don't snap it in right, it will leak.  But once we figured that out we had no problems.  We used the product starting at about 8 weeks when our son outgrew the sink but was too tiny for the tub and we stuck this tub right on our countertop for months with no problem.  Now we use it in our regular tub and it saves us from having to waste a tubful of water for one tiny person to bathe.  Our son is now almost one and he still loves this tub, great value!",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I bought this tub before reading the reviews...I wish I read it before because it leaked from day 1.  The lock on the bottom is so hard to push down.  It is even hard to slide it together for storage.  My daughter pooped while taking a bath and the water leaked.  I dont recommend this for purchase.,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I bought this tub, after having to contact the same company about the older small blue ring model after the cups gave way for no apparent reason and my 7 month went over head first. I went to Toys r Us and bought this nice new one, thinking this contraption was going to be OK. Well listen up people, what a joke, it leaks out every time, since about use after 3 times or so, my Husband can't fix it, he messed with sliding it back and forth, locking it in, which is quite difficult. Pressing on the center area doesn't work either, it just runs like a siv! I was taking this back ASAP, when I found this site, cant believe the company is still selling these. Also for the record there are very few choices in tub brands for sale in any stores,they seem to be running the show here. If they could fix the leaky problem, I think this tub would be #1, but looks grim. I leave tub on floor in larger tub, I dont move it, as the cups grab rather strong and don't release too good.But it is comfortable for sitting for 9 month baby. No water No Bath, I fill 3 times when he is in due to water running out, to let him have some time to play. SAD in Michigan.....not many choices either. I was going to exchange item , for another not knowing everyone else is saying the same thing, but NOW I KNOW.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I was so excited when I recieved this tub thinking it would last for years. Well, first you can NOT use it in your home bathtub, because the suction cups will not adhere to a non-slip surface. Most tubs are non-slip, that's what the little bumps are for in your tub. This was fine though, I planned to use it on our kitchen counter. No matter how hard I pressed on the middle ""locking"" device water always leaked out onto the counter and floor. This tub is more trouble than it's worth!",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I received the 4 in 1 bath station as a baby shower gift. One of the reasons why I registered for this item is because you can make it compact so its easy for storage, I found it very hard to keep closing it so I now keep it open which defeated the purpose of easy storage. Another reason why I think this tub is terrible is because once your baby can sit up, you can have them sit with the bar around and between her legs, once you take her out of that position her thighs rub against the bottom of the bar and leaves red scrap marks. I would not recommend this tub to anyone.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"First let me say that the mesh sling was great until our on was old enough to roll-over.  We used it by itself in the bath.  But the tub is terrible.  The part that you push to collapse the tub is right on the baby's spine and he cannot get comfortable.  And the ring doesn't fit right, so my son slides forward and it smashes his crotch.  We just have him sitting up in the bath.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"... and I'm one of them. It's not water-tight, the plastic thing that helps them sit upright is just in the way when you're trying to put a bigger baby in it- just a total joke. We ended up putting it in a bathtub full of water so our son had someplace to sit but it's a huge waste of money, water and effort! Don't buy a product when over half the people reviewing it hated it!",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I thought I must be doing something wrong - the water would pour out the bottom.  The two separate plastic peices never really snapped together.  My husband tried it and so did my father - this product is JUNK!,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"The insert is the only thing I really used for my son. I received this as a babyshower gift and was thrilled cause I didnt even think how I was going to bathe my little one. But I only used the slanted insert, and the tub was so hard his little kicking feet pounded on it, sounded painful. It leaked, and wouldnt stay clamped shut... so we just used the insert sling. That was wonderful, but you could buy that for a lot less money by itself.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I bought 2 of these.  One for our house and one for Grandma's.  Mine was a total dud.  When it was put together, it leaked and the frame for the sling was bent funny that it wobbled.  My mother's went together just fine, never leaked and the frame snapped perfectly into place.  We even used her sling after my daughter outgrew the tub.  When she was sitting on her own but I felt more comfortable with her having some support, she sat on the end of the sling, and it worked perfect!  So if you get one that doesn't guite work right, exchange it cause the next one might work fine.  It was a great tub for the price.",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I didnt realize just how many problems this bath actually had before I bough it. The water wont stay in the bath. I dont care what method you use its impossible to keep the water from leaking, or actually pouring , out. As far as it fitting in the sink I dont know what kind of sink it would fit in , but definately not mine. So basically its useless....",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I like this tub because my son cannot reach the end to push off.  The sling does not latch in place, which would help.  I do not fold it for storage because it's a pain to do.  I still like it because I don't have to use a sponge support with it.  My husband prefers to have my son sit in it without the toddler bar.  It's easier to wash him that way.  Now that my son is too big for the tub (he's 17 months old), we still use the 'sling' for him to lay on to have his hair washed and rinsed.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We had this tub with our first daughter, loved it then and we love it now.We had let our daughter use it with her outside toys when she outgrew it, so we had to buy a new one with our new baby.We had a problem the first night with leaking-that was because it had been nearly 3 years since we had used this type of tub and we didnt bother to read the instructions. Once my husband read the instructions, we were fine.It grew with our daughter. We used the sling, to the holding bar, to the actual tub. My husband says its economical, because we didnt have to fill a regular tub, saving water and energy. He is the penny pincher in this family.I highly recommend this product. I have actually bought this as a shower gift for a couple of my friends.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I registered for this tub based on the versatility it supposedly offers, however, I found that this tub and bath sling do not work well for infants.  My baby kept slipping down on the sling and would have been lying down in the tub if I didn't keep my hand under her bottom the entire.  Also, I followed the directions exactly and made sure that everything was snapped into place (which is not an easy thing to do!) and the tub still leaked.  Not a huge amount, but who wants a tub that leaks?  I ended up purchasing the Summer Infant fold-up bath seat at Babies-R-Us which I highly recommend. It made bath time less stressful for both me and my baby. I plan to try and use this tub again once my baby can sit up and use the bath ring portion.  I'm hoping this tub isn't a total waste.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I got this tub for my baby shower for my daughter.  I have to say its not at all a good tub for an newborn.  Its a pain to empty and fill.  The suction cups on the bottom are so hard to get off once they stick to something.  Its a big big pain.I do love the sling that came with it and will be using that part for our new baby due in just a few weeks.but the tub its self went to the trash about 3 months after my daughter was born 17 mo ago.Buy something else.,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We began using this tub for our premie twins this week.  After being sponge-bathed in the hospital for a month, it was time for them to get their first real baths.  We pulled the tub out to the full position and snapped it into place, and did not realize there is also a spot on the floor of the tub that also needs to be snapped down.  We initially had a flood all over the bathroom counter.  After moving the tub into our bathroom tub, and snapping it into place, the leakage seemed under control.  However, we are not willing to attempt to try using it on the countertop again.  Because of the way this tub is made, in two pieces, it seems inevitable that there will be leaks.  We are currently trying to use the infant sling to help bathe our twins, however, the boys do slip and slide down the sling.  Maybe for babies that are a little bigger, the sling may work.  However, if you have premies, or just small newborns, the sling is pretty worthless.  It was almost easier to give our boys a sponge bath, without the tub at all.  I gave this tub 3 stars, because it will probably work much better when the boys grow a little more.  For now, there's got to be a better tub out there, especially for tiny babies.",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I was hoping to get great use out of this tub, however I had to return it.  It leaks through the seam, even when it was locked.  The store I took it back to, said  lots of people have this problem.  Don't waste your money.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I was so thrilled that this would be the last tub I would have to buy.  My 11 month old loves sitting up in it, and now that I'm expecting another baby in a few months the sling would come in handy.  The only problem is that all of a sudden it leaks tremendously.  We also never really closed it up because it was too hard to do but that would have been fine to deal with if it hadn't started to leak.  Now we have to rush her out of the tub before all the water leaks out.  And with the new baby on the way it looks like we are going to have to invest in another tub.  I don't reccommend buying this.  Especially since it started to leak after we had it more than 90 days so we couldn't even return it and get something else.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"It is one of those things when the tub looks better in the box.  For an infant the tub was way to big, my daughter kept sliding down.  For a toddler the water wouldn't stay in the tub unless it was extended out to its full length...Which right there was one of the reasons I bought the tub is becase it was supposed to be compact.  I would not recommend this tub to anyone, and I wish I would have bought a nicer one.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,This bathtub has to be one of the nicest and most useful ones on the market. It is slightly large but truely does work for various ages.,4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I bought this tub thinking that it would last me a long time and the price of it was reasonable. After two months the tub started leaking. At first we thoguht we did something wrong but after a while we discoverd the strip near the crease started to wear out causing the tub to leak. This pruchase was by far the worse $20.00 I ever spent...,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"The first time we went to put water in the tub for a real bath,  the thing just started pouring water out the bottom (from between the two connecting sections).  Don't waste your money!",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I agree with everything jrcaesar said in the previous review, in fact he/she saved me quite a bit of typing. I have been using this tub for a week now, after using the Safety 1st Space Saver tub from 6 weeks til 8 1/2 months. What more can I say, I love it, my daughter loves it. We put it up on the kitchen counter and when we're done, we drag the end over the edge of the sink and pull the plug. No mess besides the water my daughter kicks all over the kitchen, and that's to be expected! P.S. The locking tabs get easier with time as long as you properly assemble the tub on a regular basis.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,My daughter is 7 months old and I've used this tub since she was born. I really like it and it hasn't leaked on me. If you expand it correctly then you probably won't have leaks either. Collapsing and expanding it does take a couple of minutes but it's not impossible. I just leave mine expanded but I don't have other children so it's not in my way. At first I used it on the bathroom counter top and the suction cups on the bottom stuck great. So well in fact that I would really have to pull on them to get them off. But at least I knew it wasn't going to move. Now I use it in the regular bathtub because my daughter sits up and likes to splash. And it's big enough to have a bunch of toys in it with her. My daughter loves her baths and I like not having to fill up the regular bathtub with more water than I need. It also has plenty of room for growth so you'll probably be able to use it for awhile. I would definitely recommend this tub if you have the room for it.,4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I bought this tub before reading reviews,and i regret it. the tub is actually 2 pieces that snap together, it is not easy to snap together. my baby is 6 months old. i tried to set him up in the little sitting tray, his little pee pee kept smushing up against the bar. not only that, but i wanted a tub that i can lay baby down in or recline. it is not easy to rinse a baby's hair when he is sitting straight up. but the way the sitting bar is positioned, if you try to rinse his hair, you cannot do it without getting water all over the place, because his back is against the edge of the bath tub.  but the thing i really dont like is that since the tub is in 2 pieces that snap together, there is a big hard plastic thing in the middle. you cannot lay baby down (without the sling, which is just for little babies) i even tried to put those little foam things in there but there is still this big lump where baby's back would be.  i will be returning this, i'm sure wal-mart will not be happy with me",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"Do not buy this tub!!!  What a hassle when it leaks all over the kitchen counter and the floor.  The leaking distracts you when you should be paying extra attention to the baby.  I read the directions and also had my husband and my mother try to fix the leaks, with no success.  Also the sling does not stay in the holes and pops out constantly.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"After using this bathtub every night for the past 27 months, I am about to order another one for baby #2.  I came across the online reviews and was very surprised to read about leaks.  Ours has never leaked.  I find it very easy to use, and I love its ability to adapt as your baby grows.  I do recall that it required some strength to assemble the first time, but putting it together was not nearly as difficult as many other baby products.  This tub is easy to fill up quickly so that you aren't spending excessive time drawing the bath rather than watching your child.  Its rounded plastic is comfortable for baby.  Plus, it doesn't lose water every time your child leans on it like the inflatable bath tubs do.  It is just the right size for a toddler and their bath toys.If you don't think you like this tub, give it a second chance.  It may work for you as a toddler tub stationed in your regular bathtub.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I got this tub as a shower gift that I didn't register for.  As a new sleep deprived mother, reading directions on how to get this piece of [...] tub to work was more than I could take.  Save yourself the frustration [...]",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"You don't need this extra hassle with bathing a little one.  Our tub has leaked from day one.  I've even taken it apart and put it back together several times.  It's leaked when we bathe him in this tub inside our tub, on the counter, or wherever we put it (even with pushing down in the ""correct"" places to help the suction).  The sling also does pop out a lot.My husband is ready to throw it out he gets so frustrated with it.  By the time you fill up the tub and get the baby undressed, about an inch of water has leaked out.At four months, my son already stretches to the end of the tub and puts his feet over the edge.  He really likes to do it, but both my husband and I feel as though he's already outgrowing it.The tub is easy to clean.  The sling is very convenient.  My son loves his bathtime, but the little issues with the tub drive us crazy.  I'd recommend seriously purchasing another tub - especially one that is all one piece so you don't have to worry about anything leaking out the seams.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I only used the tub a handful of times, but wore out the sling. When my daughter was old enough to sit on her own we bought a different tub seat. Plus, the tub doesn't fold up that much and still takes up much space.",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I received 2 tubs at my son's baby shower.  I returned the other and kept this one because it seemed like it had more features.  I wish I had kept the other because this one seems to leak every time I use it.  However, the infant sling thing is nice, and the tub itself is a good size.  I think I'd rather get a tub that doesn't leak so much.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I got this tub at one of my showers....it leakes like crazy! I have not been satisfied with this tuba at all. When I registered for it I saw nothing but good reviews, but it is not worth the money. The sling does not help at all! I get the bath ready for my 6 month old son and then go and undress him...by the time i get back in the bath room all the water is almost gone! I have had to refill the tub at least three times now. I wish i had registered for a different tub.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,Absolutely disasterously designed product. Am taking it back to buybuybaby today. We tried to use it for the first time with our newborn. Instructions could not be more vague.Then there is an area in the middle of the bath that you have to push forward to lock. I did this and all that happened is the bath length extended. I tried many many times and had no luck in hearing a 'snap' or seeing any evidence that it had locked. In the end we tried to fill it with water and it flooded our bathroom. I tried again to 'lock' it and could not get it to work.It is a poorly designed and thought through product. The manual couldn't be more vague and less helpful to new parents.Just don't buy it and save yourself the clean up mess that we just went through.I hope this helps,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This tub worked okay when she was small. I did not have much problems with her slipping when she was on the level one. I just felt the tub was akward and big and difficult to store. It also was a little difficult to clean  w/ the small crevaces it has. It did leak if you did not push down on it hard enough. When my baby was old enough for the sitting position I really stopped liking the tub. It just seemed awkward and slippery. I just didn't feel secure with her sitting up it seemed slippery. So I just started bathing her in the kitchen sink ,this was still slippery but I felt more secure and I didn't have to deal with this tub that was hard to store and bulky. Around 8 months i just started bathing here in a small amount of water in the bath tub like a sml child and she loves this.",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"When our 5 wk old is in the sling, he slides down and the middle snap-thing at the bottom of the tub digs into his bac, also leaving bruises. Very, very poor design.  Also, it doesn't even COME CLOSE to fittingin our single kitchen sink.  We refuse to use it anymore. We are gong out to ge the First Years Sure Comfort Deluxe Tub this weekend. It got 4.5 stars out of 5 on amazon and two couples we know swear b it. We should've talked to them before we put this on our registry!",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I was not very happy with the 4 in one bath station, because it leaks.  It is made in a way where the water comes out from the bottom, since this tub is interchangeable to eventually be used for a toddler.  It is not sealed properly. I donot recommend this item.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I got this tub as a baby shower gift, although I did have problems with the locking tabs, once my husband figured it out, it worked great. We took the suction cups off the bottom of the tub because they did make emptying it a nightmare, even though it has a drain, not all the water empties out. The tub works great for little babies but once my son reached 25 inches, we had to quit using it because he could kick the middle of it where the bath seat is and it would hurt his feet, but we just put the bath sling in the regular bath tub and it works fine, he loves to splash around in the water. I plan on using the tub again once he can sit up on his own since it has the bath ring in it.",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We registered for this tub and took it back the first time we used it. Yes, it does leak even when assembled correctly. The sling didn't fit into the tub quite right either. I wouldn't put my baby in it.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I thought this would be a great tub as we really needed a space-saving tub. It fit perfectly on the kitchen counter and it was easy to drain the water right into the sink. Well after a couple months I thought I was just careless and not fully extending the tub out to locking position (which the locking tabs are also hard to lock and release- you need pretty strong thumbs!), as several times I had water all over the counter and dripping down the cabinets. The problem with this tub is the rubber stripping which is at the seam between the two halves of this tub. It was completely twisted and coming off. There is not enough room to get your fingers in to fix it or replace it. As time went on the tub was leaking so bad I had to put it into the real bathtub in the bathroom. It eventually stopped holding water altogether. When I see people with this tub in their shopping carts, I immediately tell them about this tub and they can't put it back fast enough.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I bought this tub despite of poor reviews because I figured that I could make sure that this tub didn't leak.  In terms of idea, it's great.  The sling was perfect for my newborn.  The idea of it shrinking was great too.  But the tub is extremely difficult to break down.  Also, it's really hard to get the tabs to go in to &quot;lock&quot; it so it doesn't leak.  I finally just left the tabs in place.  Well, within a few days, it leaked like a sieve.  The tabs were locked, everything was fine.  It just gives way and starts leaking.  Bad investment!",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"My husband and I really liked the design of this bathtub when we decided to ask for one in our shower list. After using it for only three months my daughter could not enjoy her bath anymore since this bathtub began leaking. We do not recommend this product to any parents. It sure is safe, but certainly cannot be used for too long when the water leaks away!",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I thought this would be a great item to buy for my second baby. However, it's too much trouble with the adjustments, it doesn't have a smooth bottom surface, and there isn't enough room (even for my 3 week old!).I would buy a regular, plain baby bathtub and an infant support.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"When we first started using this tub we thought it was great, but our son is now 5 months old and we hate it.  When we started placing it in the bathtub for baths because our son was splashing all around we had so many problems.  The suction cups would stick so hard to the tub that it was impossible to move it away from the faucet without spliing the whole thing or the bottem becoming unsnappped which caused leaks.  We removed the suction cups, but the tub still has a steady leak.  It's hard enough to bath a slippery baby - don't choose this tub that causes even more trouble.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,This station is so difficult to use. Bath sling doesnot fit properly in station.,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I got this bathtub as a baby shower gift and it looked like a good one.  I did read the instructions begining to end.  The tub worked fine for about a month.  But then it started leaking bad all over the place.  Like a new mom doesn't have enough to do with out cleaning up a flood.  Anyways it just doesn't seal properly.  For awhile it would only leak when you picked up the baby and it didn't have that extra weight on it.  But now it leaks constiently.  So now I have to go buy one of the few things I didn't have to pay for in the first place.  This tub is the tub of my nightmares!  Don't waste your money and time buying this worthless piece of junk.,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I bought this tub when my twins were born and after setting it up for the first time AFTER following the directions, we had no problems with it.  The sling is very portable and was great for our many trips with the twins as infants.  As they got bigger I LOVED the bath ring feature.  And I felt like I was doing the enviroment a service as they approached 1 year when I wasn't filling the whole tub with water to bathe one tiny baby in.The suction cups work great as long as you don't have decals, etc on the floor of your tub.  There was no leaks, it was a great fit for the baby, no problems.I bought this tub again for my 3rd child and after setting it up following the directions again, it was leaking.  I called the company and told them I had a previously great experience with another one of this model tub without leaking.  They asked me about my set up and once they were assured it was done correctly,  they shipped me out a new one immediately.  They said that they did have a problem a while back with the seal leaking and this could have been one of the older tubs.  The new one works great and I love this tub all over again!!I highly recommend you get this tub...just set it up properly the first time.  You really have to press hard in the approprate spaces to seal it tightly!!!",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I got this and returned it.  Not because it was horrible, just because my daughter is already 5 months old and too big for the sling and too small for the seat.  I ended getting the Eurobath instead.  The sling was slippery for her and I couldn't get it right.  The suction cups definitely do the job!  ...that's great if you don't want it to move, but in the tub it makes it more difficult for me to fill, empty, etc.  So, that turned out to be a negative for me.  Yeah, you can pry it up, but it's frustrating.  No leaking though!!  I tested it a few times and it was leak-proof for me.  So if you're only worried about that, then this is a good tub for you.",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"My daughter constantly slides down the sling.  Every minute or two, I am lifting her back up as she slides down into the water.  Unless you have it opened and locked absolutely perfectly, it leaks all over the place",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This tub sounded like a good idea when I registered for it, but I realized soon after that it was not what it seemed to be.  First of all, it leaked after a few months of use.  We thought it was due to it not being locked properly, but we relocked it and it did no good.  Secondly, it seems like you could use this tub for many stages of your baby's life, but you really can't use it for very long at all (at least not for us).  The tub only works in ONE position, you can't make it smaller like it looks. And by the time your baby gets old enough to move around he doesn't want to be confined to a seat anymore.  The one nice thing is the soft incline that you get with it, but the tub is so long, you have to really watch the baby and keep him/her from sliding forward and down under water. So, I really did not like this tub.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I got this tub as a baby shower gift and I've been using it for 8 months now. This is a great tub to use however I also find this tub heavy and sometimes difficult to assemble.,3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I loved this tub! First of all though, I never took it apart. My kids have their own bathroom and we just left it set up! I loved the sling as I did the bath ring. I did try the free standing bath rings and found that 9 out of 10 times it did not stay attached to the tub. I am actually pregnant again and am buying the same one a second time b/c I got rid of my first one. I loved it!",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We bought this tub after using one of the other baby tubs.  Our friend had this tub and said it was terrific.  I really didn't belive her.  However, after using it I love it!  My son is so happy when he gets his bath.  He is 4 months old and can kick his feet in it without a problem.  He can't sit up on his own yet so I still use the sling with a yellow teddy bear sponge to help support him from slipping.  I expanded the tub and it is a great size for my tall baby.  It drains really well also!  I don't have any problems with leaks.  You have to make sure that you latch the parts together properly so it doesn't leak.  It says that in the directions!  Overall I am very happy with this tub!",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This item is junk.  I originally chose it because it was a great concept, following the child through the stages.  I received it as a shower gift from my registry and once home I wanted to try it out.  When I expanded the tub, the center never snapped into place, so I could imagine that it would leak water out of it and perhaps could even pinch the baby's skin.  I tried everything to get it to snap but had no luck.  Then when I tried to collapse it I had such difficulty that by the time I was finished both of my hands were bright red from pushing and pulling and pressing the tabs.  The tabs on the sides were impossible to push down.  I thought this was a very poorly designed product and took it back immediately and purchased just a regular tub with an infant attachment.  Don't waste your money on this product, it is junk!",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I purchased this tub because the toddler ring will not suction to the bottom of our tub.  This tub seemed to have great features, particularly the easy storage feature.  However, the underside of the inner ring has sharp edges, leaving my 6 month old with red marks across her chest and arms.  I have already returned it and was very disappointed.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"The sling is very secure - even in a round shaped sink, and provided me and my baby with a much more comfortable bath time session. My daughter - 5 weeks old- rested comfortably on the sling and enjoyed her bath. I pray it does not leak",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We had gotten this tub as a gift from the inlaws.  I did read the reviews at that time and most had been poor reviews, however we tried it anyway.  We love the tub!  Some of the reviews had complained that the tub leaked but as long as you follow the instructions there is no problem.  My son is now six months old and we have used this tub since he came home from the hospital.  The sling was wonderful and now he is old enough to sit up in the tub.  He just loves it.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I thought that this tub was great and got lots of use out of it.  I never had any problems with it leaking. I did use it both on the counter and in the tub, though I preferred to just put it in the regular bathtub because it was easier to fill up.  If you properly put it together and hear the ""snap"", it won't leak, and I like the suction cups on the bottom.  At first I thought that the sling would somehow snap in and I found it a little confusing, then I just draped it over the side and that worked for me and I suppose that's how it's meant to be used.  I have used the one piece tubs and I found them awkward and difficult to use.  I like how the sling in this one gave a little (not like those hard tubs with the cheap foam pads) and put him at a slight angle and more in the water.  I had a large baby (both in hieght and weight) and never had any size issues with this tub.  I eventually just bought the regular tub seat that hooks onto the side of the tub because although it's still big, it was easier to find a place to store it.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I orignally purchased this tub because it is a product of Safety 1st and because I thought it would be a great long-term bath for my baby since it has the ability to expand, collapse, and had a place for babies or toddlers to up in. Boy was I wrong.The first one I had began leaking a few weeks after I had been using it. We took it back for a replacement and a month or two later it starts leaking again, even worse than the first one leaked! I had to place towels underneath it before I filled it up with water and this morning  all the water just spewed out of the bottom soaking the entire towel and getting my bathroom counter all wet.I am taking it back today and finding a better tub. I wouldn't recommend this tub to anyone. If you look at the actual construction of the tub there is an evident hole beneath the tub between the two parts of plastic which has been rigged to absorb the water with a piece of sponge. Very ineffective product. I plan on writing to the manufacturer as well and encourage them to either stop selling this faulty product or revise the tub and stop the leaking.Hope this helps you.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"Don't waste your money, even if you follow the directions, it still leaks.  I ignored the reviews and registered for it anyway because I thought that it was cute and practical.  In the beginning, we read the instructions and did not have any problems at all.  My son is 5 months old now, and by the time that we finish with his bath, he's sitting in an empty tub. Take heed!!!!  If not, you can't say that no one told you.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I was given this tub as a gift and the tub does indeed leak like others have written, but the SLING is great!  We have been just using the bath sling in our tub since our baby was able to tub bathe and now our 4 month old still loves it!  It reclines just enough to keep his head out of the water and it doesn't take a lot of water to fill the tub.  It made bath time easy.  The bath sling needs to be sold seperately for that purpose.  No baby bathtub needed if you have this.  I didn't like other baby bathtubs because it seemed to be a hassle filling the tub and emptying it everytime you give a bath.  With this you can just fill the tub and drain it at the end of the bath.  Simple and easy.  Worth buying the tub to get the sling!",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I had such high hopes for this tub. It looks so neat on the outside of the box, but looks can deceive!! I am still using it, but I ""cuss"" at it every time for leaking all over!. I use it over my kitchen sink-as I have a spout that pulls out- and i have to surround the tub with towels so I do not get water all over everywhere. When you think about it's design, you realize what a stupid idea it is! A tub with a crack in the bottom! Destined to leak. If you want to make yourself clean your floors and countertops every time you bath baby -this is the tub for you - otherwise, save yourself the trouble and get something better!!",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"My baby girl is 8 months this month &amp; I have enjoyed it since her first bath! Since Macy was learning to sit on her own the ring has been there to prevent her from falling forward accidentally or when she reaches forward &amp; has been a great idea. The only thing is I think it could use some foam padding around the ring, though that plastic isn't harmful just would be more comfy I think. I would recommend it! I have to my sister expecting in April! Great Gift Idea! Good luck Brandi!",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"My baby is now 8 months old and we have decided to give up the hassle of using this bathtub.  First, it leaks through the division in the middle.  At the beginning it wasn't everyday but a few weeks ago we had to bathe our baby girl quickly so we wouldn't loose the water.  Second, the cloth in the bouncer-like baby holder is supposed to be mildew proof..Not!  I have even tried drying it by sunlight and it still smelled weird.  You have to wash it every couple of days.  Third, I would put the tub upside down resting on the bathtub and I would still find yellow mildew through the cracks and underneath the sitting attachment.  Fourth, the sitting attachment would not work for my baby girl.  It makes them sit too tightly and I couldn't reach her very well to bathe her.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,I chose this product for my registry without reading any reviews. I immediately began using it with my newborn daughter and it worked great. I loved the idea of the plug because you can empty out all the water easily. The only bad part was that there were many cracks which were difficult to keep clean and dry which would cause to get moldy. I thought that was pretty disgusting. But I continued to keep using it until the bottom just all of a sudden cracked one day and I had to throw it out. Now I am pregnant again and am searching for a better tub for my baby.,3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I received this as a shower gift and thought it was fabulous until I actually began to use it.  For the first couple of months I used the sling however, when my son began to get active, he would kick at the water so much that the sling wouldn't stay clipped in.  Once he was able to sit, I began to use the ring.  I discontinued use of it soon after because the ring actually cut his stomach when he leaned over the ring to grab his rubber ducky.  He is very chunky. A 20 lb, breastfed, 5 month old.  So I think that his stomach got pinched between his legs and the ring, and when he turned his body, it gave him a scratch.  I realized then that the underneath of the plastic ring is very rough and seems a bit sharp as well.  It also leaked the entire time, but wasn't too big a deal for me being that I used it in the tub anyway.  And I WAS locking it during each use.  Now that he is able to hold his head up, I just use my bath tub.  He seems to enjoy it more anyway.",2
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I liked this tub.  My son also likes this tub.  He likes to lay on his sling or sit on the tup and splash water around.  He used to hate baths, but when we got this, he loved it.  It never leaked, but we do leave it on the extended position because it was a hassle opening it and closing it.  We give the baby a bath every night and clean it right after so we never had a problem with mold or anything.  The only thing is, when I fill it up with water and I put it on the sink, it's pretty heavy and the suctions work a little too good, so it's kind of complicated lifting it and trying to get the suctions to not suck and making the water not spill at the same time.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"We followed the assembly instructions but since the first use, the water was leaking and the bath time was a hard time for me.There are so many bath tubs in the stores that are so much easy to handle than this.",3
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,After using this tub for 11 weeks we found mildew had grown underneath the tub where the two pieces snap in place plus under the blue ring.  I immediately threw it away and went and bought a tub that does not snap together. I do not recommend it unless u plan to pull it apart after each use so it can dry properly.,1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I received the bath station as a gift at my baby shower.  I had put it on my registry thinking it was great to have tub since I could use it until my son reached his toddler years.  At first I had to figure out how to assemble the tub which took me a little while to do, because it was so hard to pull together.  After I used the bath station it was fine for a couple of uses (about six times) then all of a sudden water started leaking from the tub from the sides now I have to go and buy a new one.  I recommend you do not buy this product.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"This is the WORST bathtub EVER! It leaks where the seams are, and the sling is awful..does not support well. Also, where the seam of the tub is on the inside, there is a ridge that digs into baby's lower back, which doesn't seem too comfortable to me. The sling is too weak to hold baby up over this... even as a newborn (mine was only 6 lbs at birth!). You have to use at least one hand to hold baby up or to keep from slipping into the water (SAFETY HAZARD!!! HELLO!!!!!) So your hands aren't both free to clean baby. Just take my (and everyone else's it seems) advice and do not buy this or put it on your registry. I have, however, heard many good things about the eurobath. I think I'm going to buy that one to replace this piece o' bumpkiss.",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,At first It was okay I'll admit that. Until I dedcided to use it more often I thought now I can give my baby a wonderful bath.  Well I followed the directions and set it up properly but the seal on it is terrible.  I had it leak on my countertops I had to shove towels under it before it could leak all over the place.  I Am supposed to get soaked from the baby splashing not the a leaky tub. I do use it in the tub now but I have to fill her tub every few minutes to keep it at a decent height.,1
Pack and Play Netting,"We love camping-- so this bug net was great for keeping over the pack and play while she slept, and also great for covering the stroller while out on walks in the woods. It's such a low price, absolutely worth it.",5
Pack and Play Netting,"I love it!  It definitely covers my playpen and the stroller very well!  There are no bugs that have been able to penetrate it.  The best part is that I can still see my little one, and she can see me, too!  It is very compactable when not in use.  VERY easy to use.",5
Pack and Play Netting,The Pack and Play Netting is a must have if you intend to ever have your Pack and Play outside.  The netting keeps the bugs out! It is very light weight so you can easily pack it in your diaper bag.  It also fits easily over the Graco Pack and Plays.,5
NoJo Secure Me Seat - Plaid,"This has adapted well to restaurant high chairs and carts.  The material is very attractive, and it wipes clean easily.  Worth the price IF you use it a lot (I often forget to use ours!).",4
NoJo Secure Me Seat - Plaid,I bought this seat when my son was five months and was still having a little problems with sitting up and the belt on this helped him sit up in the shopping carts and i didnt have to worry about him chewing on the shopping car bar. My only complant is what about the sides of the cart.,4
NoJo Secure Me Seat - Plaid,"I absolutely love this travel seat.  Everytime I go into a store, people ask me where I purchased this item.  It is a must have for any new parent.  However, I gave this item 4 stars rather than 5, because my son still finds a way to put his mouth and/or hands on the exposed parts of the shopping cart.  This is because the seat and handle cover do not cover the whole seat/handle (but it is better than having him sit directly on a dirty seat).  I would recommend this seat to any and every parent.",4
NoJo Secure Me Seat - Plaid,"My 8mo.old would not ride in a shopping cart, I found this item on a friends gift registry and bought it for myself.. Turned out to be the best money Ive spent in awhile.. My son rides without any problems now. Thank you thank you thank you......",5
"Snoozy Jersey Knit Crib Sheet Featuring Saftey Stay on Corners, Ecru, 28&quot; x 52&quot;","THis sheet is okay and gets the job done, but I was disappointed with how it was constructed.  There isn't any elastic on if and it looks as it it could have been sewn by me - kind of fits like a pillow case, but wit hthe opening down the back of it instead of at the head or foot of the mattress.  I feel like I could have bought the material and made it myself.  Maybe I'll do that in the future and use this as a guide for how to put one together.  All in all it works and washes fine, but not what I expected.  I wouldn't pay too much for it.",3
"Snoozy Jersey Knit Crib Sheet Featuring Saftey Stay on Corners, Ecru, 28&quot; x 52&quot;","I purchased this crib sheet because I have previouly owned jersey knit sheets for twin size beds and thought it would be nice for our newborn.  I thought it would feel more comfortable on her skin than basic crib sheets.  This particular sheet does not feel like other jersey knit sheets I have owned.  It does not feel soft at all.  (Jersey sheets are supposed to feel soft like an old t-shirt).  It is also really thin.  It does fit fine on the mattress, not too tight, not too loose.  I would not recommend this sheet.",2
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"My husband and I both can be in this (with the extension kit) with our twin 9 month olds. It's the only portable play area/ pen we've found that's big enough for both kids, especially now that they're mobile. It's very stable, and has withstood my leaning on it, several attempts by the babies to move it, a babysitter, two cats and a clutzy uncle. The only potential drawback: unless you can step over the sides (which was an uncle problem), you'll need two free hands to open a passage for yourself.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"Let me start off by saying I read almost all the reviews for this product (250 or so)before I decided to buy it. I was a bit skeptical, because I read many that said parts break off, and its really hard to fold and unfold, but so far I am extremely pleased with the superyard. (It's not difficult to position if you're strong enough to lift a baby up and down, up and down, a thousand times a day.)Like a few people have said, if you just use common sense this product is great.I have an extremely bouncy, lightning fast 8 month old, and even without the extension the superyard is big enough that he can move around without getting antsy, and strong enough for him to pull up on and cruise around.The only thing I can say that's negative about it is that it is big and clunky (its meant to give them more space than a pack and play type play yard)and it is fairly unattractive.For the price, it's a great find. Use some common sense, and it will serve you well.",4
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"This is a great find for anyone with children two and under.First, this play yard is an all-purpose containment field for the little ones.  It is about twice as large as the average play yard, and can be configured several different ways to fit your area.  It goes indoors and out.  My kids have spent many an hour playing happily on our living room carpet without any childproofing necessary.Second, it is darn near indestructible.  Unlike conventional play yards with the soft padded sides and rippable netting, this is made of sturdy, thick polyurethane.  I have no doubt this thing will be around long after our second boy outgrows it.  It will probably outlast me.Third, it is much easier to setup or pack and fold than any other play yard that I've ever tried.Finally, the super play yard is safer and more comfortable for our kids.  Because the bottom is whatever it happens to be set up on at the moment, you don't have to worry about sagging and collapsing.Fourth, you will find endless uses for it.  The super play yard is currently surrounding the Christmas tree and presents.  In the past I have also used it in place of a safety gate where the doorway was too wide otherwise.  No doubt we will use it to corral a new puppy someday.Although there will always be a place for the conventional padded playyards, we find ourselves using them much less often.  We may just get rid of them altogether.  The super play yard is definitely a keeper.-Andrea. aka Merribelle",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"Superyard XT is an excellent product for child containment, providing exactly the protection a parent desires for outdoor play. It isn't a very large gate- even when fully extended, it covers an area only about the size of a medium to large playpen. But it offers enough space to keep one or two kids (and their toys) safely occupied.Superyard XT holds up well and I have left it outside during harsh weather conditions with no problems. It is very easy to clean and to transport. The panels fold together and the carrying strap makes the job even easier still. The panels do not fold completely flat- they do have some thickness, so don't expect this gate to fit into a tiny space. It needs at least enough space to accommodate the thickness when all six panels are folded together.The panels on Superyard XT are not very tall and because of this, the gate is good only for toddlers and other kids up to about two years of age. As children get older, they will be able to climb over the walls of the gate or possibly knock it down, making it impractical as a containment device. But the shorter height has one clear advantage: It makes it easy for parents because it can be stepped over. There is no need to dissemble the panels or open the gate to get inside.Superyard XT is solid and sturdy but consumers must be careful to position it properly. The gates cannot be placed in a straight line because the design of the gate diminishes its effectiveness when used in this manner. Each one of the joints has to be bent in order to become sturdy. Placed in a straight line, the gate cannot resist pressure and it will fall over with the slightest push.The only complaint I have with Superyard XT is the small space it covers. With the limited space, some people may have difficulty fitting even two kids inside the closed walls of the gate. Depending on the number of toys your kids have, one child might be all that will fit. This is why I strongly recommend purchasing an extension kit. This kit consists of two additional panels and while this doesn't sound like much, it increases the area substantially and it makes the gate capable of handling two kids with no problems.Overall, Superyard XT is a very good gate for child or pet containment. I brushed it off when I first saw it because it seemed like another useless product with limited use, marketed solely to take our hard earned money. But now that I own the Superyard, I cannot imagine life without this containment device. It offers kids a place to play where they are well- protected, giving parents some much needed peace of mind.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I must say that I tossed back and forth whether I should purchase this 'baby jail' or not.  I was worried that I would be hindering my child's curiosity and I sort of felt bad.  I decided to go ahead and purchase this product anyway because I realized that I was not getting ANYTHING accomplished during my day (other than playing ... which is REALLY important too, don't get me wrong).  I'm a stay at home mom and my baby is 14 months. She's toddling around and getting into everything.  It was hard for me to even quickly run to the bathroom before she bolted across the room for the computer wires, outlets, TV, etc...Anyway, my point is ... What on earth did I do without this 'fun zone'?  This morning I was able to sit in the room with my daughter and sort dirty laundry without her picking it up and putting it in her mouth.  She LOVES this area.  I change up her toys on a daily basis so she doesn't get bored.  This structure is sturdy and with one added panel it's a nice big area.  When I was her age, my mom used a playpen.  It was much smaller and wasn't a good area to practice walking.BUY THIS PRODUCT ... Don't feel as though it is a 'baby jail'; think of this as a safe 'fun zone' that helps keep mommy sane.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I bought this Play yard at the Toy-R-US store becuase I felt that my 15th month old was getting too big for the pack-n-play and I needed ""something with space"" that she could be safe playing in while I cook,clean, or go to the bathroom for that matter! This has been a God send for me, becuase she's at that busy accident prone stage, and it gives me an extra hand when I need it! My pre-school age daycare kids like to play in it too, so I think I might purchase the attachment for it to make it bigger. The only downfall I had to it was the connector thing. It was kinda tricky to connect together, so I rate this Play Yard at 4 1/2 stars. Buy it! It will save you a lot of stress when you need an extra hand :o)",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,I love the play yard. My grandson is safe to play without worry of the bigger children or dog being able tp get to him.,5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"This gate certainly comes in handy.  It's versatile and light-weight.  I like that you can remove sections to scale for different needs.  I think my favorite part is the height.  It's a little lower than most safety gates, making it easy to hop over.However, I always struggle when adjusting the position of the sections. My husband eventually broke one piece trying to fold it. It really resists popping into place at times. So I'm not sure I could recommend it if you plan to open and close it often. It's best when set up and left alone.Having said that, we'd be lost without it to keep our son away from the TV.  I'd love to find an easier (and prettier) solution.",2
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I love this gate! It can stand alone or you can add the extentions to it to make it as large as you need. My son plays in this large gated area that has a very open feel to it - he does not feel confined to a small space like the pack n- play. Sometimes he's not even aware he has the boundries around him because he is so busy playing. I can put his favorite toys in the playyard and he is safe as he plays. He has his down time in the playyard too.  Sometimes my 4 year old gets in there with him and they play together.  The one thing you have to beware of is that when he wants to he can drag it to another area in the room.  It is a lightweight gate, however it has never tipped over.  This gate  has been such a sanity saver that I sent it to my friend who has 2 babies 19 months apart!",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,This is a great product!  I use it to contain one of my dogs when we go out and then fold it up and put it in a closet in-between uses!  Love it!!,5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I have 6 month old twins and just got this Superyard two weeks ago.  It's great. I had not seen anything else like it on the market for this price.  Since I have twins all other play yards just weren't going to be big enough, but this one is, especially with the extension kit, so they don't feel confined. I can even get in with them and play.  The Superyard XT keeps my babies from rolling or crawling away into danger.  I put a blanket on the floor and let the babies play.Just remember although its sturdy heavy molded plastic, it is still just plastic.  Use your common sense and it's a great safety tool.Note:  The yard must be set up so all hinges are at an angle, i.e. you can not set this up to make a rectangle and have it be safe, it must be in a shape such as a hexagon or octagon, so make sure your room is big enough.  We had to move out a chair to make room for it. . . well worth the move!  Also no more than one extension kit per Superyard; once it reaches the octagon shape, more extension kits make it unstable.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I wanted something that I could put my daughter in and she could crawl around safely.  The playpen was too small and she needed more room to explore.  I bought the extension kit immediately to make it seem even more bigger and she hardly even realizes it's an enclosure.  She has taught herself within a week how to stand up on her own and loves that she can still see everything that is going on around her.  I think it will be useful as she grows - even when we can use it to block off things such as the fireplace and Christmas tree...  It is easy to set up and can even fold up if you wanted to bring it to the beach, picnic, family gathering, etc.  It's made of a hard plastic that can easily be rinsed off.  I love it and am extremely happy with this play yard and more importantly my daughter is!!",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"This is a good product and does indeed corral kids and pets as advertised.  The springs in the hinges, however, are very strong and make changing the angle of the corners quite a challenge at times.  We had such difficulty with one of the hinges we actually broke it trying to change it.  With a little practice, you can probably figure out the best method.  The ideal scenario for us was to set it up and leave it.  Once up and in place it works great.",4
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"The Playgate came in a good size box that was easy to unpack. I unfolded the gate without any problems. The Playgate is a great weight and holds up very nice!! I use the play gate for my 2 puppies. They can see us and still play in safety when I can't watch them, its a great  playgate for my puppies, very sturdy and well worth every dime. The price was a good value!!!",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I was a bit surprise to see how ugly this gate can be.  It takes up space and is just an ugly plastic gate.Three stars because it delivers well for what it's supposed to do.  However, the sheer size of it doesn't make it an attractive buy.We sold it back for $20 by putting it in one of our local newspaper's classified section.",3
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"We bought 3 sets... family is buying them also.  Great idea for when you have to keep the little ones in a safe space, our twins love being and playing in it",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"This is a stay-at-home mom's lifesaver!As my little boy (now 9 months) has become moremobile, this product has helped tremendously.It has broadened his world but in an enclosed space.We keep his play yard in a corner within the superyard, in the children's playroom.He never gets tired of it. He can play with his toys,while I check my email, do the laundry and watch him at the same time. He loves it!He can crawl or cruise within his area and can see me whilehe plays. It's great that you can adjust the individual pieces.I recommend buying the extra parts to have a larger space for baby to roam in. It never hurts to have extra, in case one breaks. Great product! We have great fun playing in it together!",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I bought this for my home and office, since my 10 month old grandson visits 2x a week.  It is wonderful, the only caution is that when you add additional extensions (we joined 1.5 superyards together)(and you will most likely need to, as it is not bigger enough without them) it is not as sturdy, so something to support it is necessary (put up against a wall or an ottoman on the outside to brace).  Also, the only criticism I have is that it is difficult to disconnect when entering or exiting the play area. Overall, however, I am very pleased with it.",4
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I bought the Superyard when my daughter was 6 months old.  We had just bought a house and were remodeling and didn't want her to get into anything.  She was crawling already and didn't like being ""penned up"" in her little pack n' play.  Besides the fact that she hated it, (She doesn't like to be confined to one area) it worked well.  Last Christmas, our daugher was 12 months old and wouldn't leave the Christmas tree alone so we pulled the Superyard out of storage and put it around the tree.  For that use alone it was worth it.  Like another review has said, Use common sense when using this product.  An adult falling on it will collapse it.  If your not tall enough to put the child in it safely by reaching over the top, open it up.",4
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"We got the superyard (or, as I call it, the &quot;Steel Cage Death Match&quot; yard) to contain our child in the living room and den while we are working. This is our experience. Your mileage may vary.Plus side: The fence itself is robust and basically indestructable. In it's four or five sided form, it's very stable, even against toddler rage! (&quot;Attica, Attica!&quot;) The sides can be taken apart, to make smaller areas.Minus side: the folding and locking mechanism is very stiff, and I was afraid I was breaking it at first when I was opening it up. So far it's not too much of a problem. The whole system is pretty heavy, and not nearly as portable as they try to tell you. Also, it's pretty clunky and large, so once it's up, we keep it up. The major downside is the price. Ack.",4
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,This is a very small enclosure... I am saving to buy another one because at this point it is useless. I do think that once it's connected it's sturdy and I haven't had the issue of it collapsing like some posted. My son is 18 months and it contains him just fine and he does not try to climb it.,3
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,This provides an ideal safe play space for a crawling infant or toddler. Very sturdy. Easy to assemble. Would recommend.,5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"Everything else I have bought for my children needed all sorts of tools and such.. this needed nothing! It was already put together! How great is that! It has a lot of room inside it for my daughter (6 months), and my son who is 5! I think it is the best $ I have spent so far! My mother has the other type of play-yard and she does not like it at all. And because of how tall it is, I am sure she will not outgrow it as fast as she would have outgrown the other play-yard!I am so pleased with my purchase! I bet you will be also!!",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I have one year old twins (a boy and a girl) and they are very active.  This has been a lifesaver.  We call it their ""corral"".  If I need to get a shower or cook or do anything that I can't keep a constant watch over the twins, I put them in the ""corral"".  We take it with us camping, to the beach, to Meme and Granddaddy's house and to family reunions.  We bought the extension set also so it would be big enough for two.  I can't rave about it enough.  We attach fun toys to the sides of it and the babies really like it.  In case you are wondering about older kids, it contains my very active two year old neice when she visits as well. This is something I couldn't live without.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"The Superyard XT is a wonderful product for babies who have outgrown their bouncers/swings, etc.  Once babies start to sit up and discover that they can crawl they don't want to be confined and this allows them to explore and play in a safe environment. It is rigid enough for the babies to play in and great for when they pull-up and ""cruise"" around.  I am astonished at the very few negative reviews of this product.  I have twin boys who are delighted every time we go into the Superyard.  It allows us all to play(one average sized adult and two 10 month old boys fit just fine with room to spare without extensions)safely.  I would recommend attaching link-a-doos to the gate as this gives them something to play with as well.  Run to the store DO NOT WALK for this product.  A definate must for mobile babies.  Enjoy!!!  Plus it gives mom and dad a few minutes to breathe.....Hope this review helps.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"very well made, fast set-up. if wanting to increase the size, don't bother with the extention kit, just get another one of these.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"Bought it for my grandchildren, it worked great to keep them away from Christmas trees and villages. Can be used in two places when taken apart.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"We got this set and extension kit and also 9 foam mats 2*2 feet at Toysrus and created very nice playard for our 7 moth old daughter. She plays in it along with her toys, has a lot of space and it's easy for me to clean.I'm glad we have it.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,I actually use this to help raise my miniature pigs. It works great and the piglets can not escape out of it like they can with the metal ones. reoranch.com,5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,I bought this gate to take apart and use it as a way to trap my puppy in the kitchen and off the furniture. It is easy to lift and move around. I also take it outside and use it for what is intended for--keeping the kids safe in the yard!! Great piece of equipement.,5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"My son is 8 mos old and already is into everything!  I was afraid he would feel too confined, but with his favorite toys in reach he couldn't be happier!  It was very easy to set up and is not a total eyesore in our living room.  All in all, it was a great purchase!",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"ease of assembly to larger kit, quick delivery - haven't yet placed in use as it is a gift for the grand children so i can't rate it higher",4
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,I bought this play yard for my grandson on Nov. 7.  It arrived with one section chipped.  It's also very large and leaves no room in our family room for people to walk.  It was on sale two weeks later at another location for $30 less.  I tried to return it but the company wanted a 25% restocking fee.  I would not recommend this play yard nor the company that sells it.,1
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"Gate looks like it would work great if you're thinking of using it as the ""superyard"" it's designed to be; however, for any of you who are simply looking to block off a thru-way larger than 8 feet -- like I was -- this gate will not work. It says right in the instructions not to use it in a ""straight"" position. The main problem is that there is no way to mount it to the wall. We tried to sturdy it by propping it between the partial walls on each side of the thru-way on one side and our couch on the other. This kept the gate upright, but it was very unsturdy so we decided to return it and look for something else.Unfortunately, the only other gate I've found so far that is large enough to block our 9 foot space is the Keepsafe Expansion gate",4
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I think many of the positive reviews are coming from parents with calm, docile babies, or parents who have not used this play yard system more than 2 months.My son is only 8 months, but very mobile. He pulls to stand and regardless of the shape or orientation of the play yard he can easily tip it over. Square, hexagon, rectangle, he can flip it. Plus, it is VERY difficult to open. It's barely possible to open with just one person let alone one handed.  No one-handed option.  Today, I tried to reconfigure it into yet another shape to see if that would minimize flipping and CRACK, I broke off a piece of the connecting hinges. And yes, they are sharp. This product is poorly designed, and frankly a stupid item. It's a total waste of money.",1
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,We use this as an outside/inside pen for our bunnies.  Personally for children or medium dogs I would buy three of them to connect together and make a play pen worth playing in. The one for our bunnies serves its purpose but I wouldn&#8217;t stick a kid or small dog in it for the space it offers is limited. On the other hand two of them would take up your living space quite a bit. Also if you have children it would be excellent as long as they can&#8217;t climb.,5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"Easy to put away and can make any shape out of it. Note- when folding it up, it makes a snap-sound to fold the gates together when putting away.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"We use ours to cordon off the computer area in the living room.  This way, our son has free reign over all the safe areas of the room while we know the computer and bookshelves are safely fenced off.  It is an amazingly versatile product that I would highly recommend to any parent.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I have a 14 month old and one of her favorite things to do is play in her &quot;hexagon&quot; as we call it. I feel so confident having the yard to give my baby boundaries. She is not distracted with items in hour home that are off-limits, and yet she still has plenty of room to groove. She even took her first steps, with confidence, in the healthy boundaries of the Superyard. I really do not see it as a cage, and it saddens me to hear others criticize it as such. My daughter reads books, plays with dolls, and makes music and noise... all kinds of imaginative play... and all in this Superyard. I love to sneak up and watch her play without knowing I am there.The Superyard is like a room where everything is always baby proof, and ALWAYS CLEAN. It is VERY durable... I reposition it almost daily. I have taken it to the park for Barbeques, to the beach, and to friend's homes for use outdoors in the grass. I have a much more pleasant time with my daughter when we have this option, not to mention she is much less frustrated because I am not constantly telling her ""No"". I believe children must learn their boundaries, rather than putting everything up. I also realize that children vary just as adults do. If your child has the strength to move this Superyard, he/she is too mature for the product, however that does not make it unsafe for others. I conquer that it is not intended for use on surfaces such as hard wood, tile, and linoleum, without rubber reinforcements, but not at the fault of the product, just a result of two incompatible surfaces. This product has changed that way my baby plays on her own, and has changed my life. If you are considering purchasing this product, DO IT, and get the extra panel while you are at it. You will be thrilled with the freedom it allows you and your baby.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,,5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"the product was delivered as promised. i love the playyard but i think it could have been a little sturdier,depending on the energy of the child .",4
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,we got this as a shower gift for our twins...it is fine except that it came filthy in the box and it is very difficult to wipe down because of all the little indents and patterns in the plastic. it seems insane that a child's product would come so filthy straight out of the box.,1
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"This was great for helping me keep an eye on my little one while I worked. I was working from home, and most days I was upstairs and on the computer. Once she could crawl, she started crawling toward everything dangerous. The litter box, the stairs, plugs, you name it, she found a way to get to it. I bought this and it was great! We even purchased the extension kit, so she basically had the whole room, yet was contained. My oldest son even liked to get in with her to play so she was never &quot;lonely&quot;.I also used this outdoors a lot during summer months. My family is big on campfires and cookouts and this was a great way to ensure her safety, yet not have her confined to a play pen!",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I bought the same exact item from a pet store for 2x the price.  The company markets the item as the Petyard XT and it is the SAME EXACT ITEM!!!  Luckily my girlfriend, who has a baby, told me about the superyard.  I have linked my $100 petyard with my $50 superyard (they fit exactly) and my new puppy has a large safe play area.  I would definitely recommend this item to any puppy owner!",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,My hubby noticed this product when we were at Babies&quot;R&quot;Us. I really wasnt crazy about it and tried to talk him out of buying it. I finally gave in and we even purchased the extention for it. I LOVE IT!! I cant believe I almost passed it up. My son is 19 months old now and he still enjoys it. He has yet to try to climb out of it. Once I put him in he sits and plays with his toys. Did I mention how HUGE it is. I can climb in and play with him. My hubby even climbs and is able to play with our son without a problem. You cant do that with other playpens.We have 2 dogs so this comes in handy when I dont want the puppies to disturb his playtime.We have a portable play pen and its just to small. we really didnt care for any other play pens we look at as they were not any bigger.I wanted my son to have enough room to walk and play without having to worry about him getting into something if the doorbell rang or phone rang.If your considering a playpen I certainly recommend this one. I'd get the extention as well. Your child will really enjoy the the HUGE space to play in.I GIVE IT 5 STARS!! WORTH EVERY PENNY!,5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I absolutely LOVE the Superyard!  It has many different uses, very versatile and we have used it inside and outside.  The fact that you can buy extension kits makes it even more useful.  We have a very active 17 month old who is content to play in the superyard with her toys, and I get in there with her to play.  She has lots of freedom to walk around and I don't have to chase her all day.I agree with the other reviews that of course you have to use common sense.  We have little trouble folding it up-and we have already added an extension kit to make it bigger.  It's great to take places--way better than lots of different gates all over the house!We will definitely use this one for our next one --and will probably be adding more extension kits to it!I don't mind the holes, and when kids have shoes on you don't have to worry about them putting their toes in the holes and trying to climb.  Just don't put big things in there that they can stand on and try to climb--again, common sense.I love it!",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I just love the superyard gate system. It is so easy to set up and take down. I have no worries that this gate sysyem will provide the safety that I need for the 4 toddlers that i care for, when we are playing indoors or out. I also purchased the extension gate, and plan on peurchaseing another superyard and the extension to make a bigger area for when we really get outside. This product was the best investment that i have made. The cost was excellent and the delivery time was also great.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,Gate work very well. It takes some effort to separate the panels but that also means my child won't be able to do it.  It's designed to go in a hexagon shape for the most stability. I use it has a blocker for areas I don't want my child to access but if your not careful a small child could easily pull it over when using the product this way. Overall the gate performed better than I expected.,4
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"We have an older child and this gate helps to keep the baby away from the legos and other small toys.  It also helps in our house as there is no way to block off our kitchen with a regular baby gate.  We have used it outside as well.  We do not have a playpen so this has helped to &quot;contain&quot; the baby while we are in the front yard which has no fence.  It is a bit difficult to find a place to store it when it is not in use.  It keeps getting moved from room to room, but that's really the only problem we've had with it so far.",4
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"It's a lot bulkier than I expected.  I love the convenience of having my little one limited to a specific area, but it's a bit difficult to manuever about, as it's heavy and somewhat challenging to adjust the segments.  And it's BIG.  I guess I may appreciate this more when my 7 month old is into climbing and such, but right now I just struggle with how big and bulky it is.  A bit hard for me to just fold it up and move it back and forth from inside to outside, as the links fold not by a smooth fluid movement, but by hard-to-adjust ""clicks"".",3
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"We have three toddlers, ages 4,3,and 14 months. We bought this for our living room and also outside for our 14 month old, as he refuses to stay in his tot block playpen! We bought this superyard yesterday and set it up in the living room. It was virtually impossible to get into the ""hexagon"" position. everytime we would adjust one angle, another would pop out of place. Once we finally got it in something vaguely resembling the picture on the box, we put our son in. All was well until he stood up. Even on the carpet he was able to push the whole yard around at will. When our 3 and 4 year olds joined him it was like demolition derby! They moved it all over the place, knocking over whichever sibling was not holding on to the same side!! It is currently collapsed and sitting on our porch! We will try it outside this evening, but based on the other reviews I have read, I don't expect that it will perform much better outdoors...",1
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"This makes a nice safe play area for kids or pets.  It folds up easy and is very transportable.  Use it at the beach, camping, park or at home.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,I just got this item and already i'n in love with it. I have peace of mind leaving my 8 month old in it while i run a load of clothes in the wash or something else. Its very sturdy and can with hold a lot. She likes having the freedom to crawl around and there is room for that and her toys. Its a great item and would sugguest this to anyone who has little ones.,5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I have 10 month old twins and the Superyard is great because it keeps them in safe place where they can crawl and play. If the twins choose to go in different directions, their range is limited. It is even sturdy enough that they both stand and lean on the fencing and it does not tip over. They are confined to a set area and I don't have to worry about them getting into something I may have forgotten to baby proof in the house. Plus their toys are in one place in the room, not all over.This is great product if you want your child to have some independence and be safe.",5
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"I recieved this as a shower gift and began using it when my daughter began to crawl.  It was better than any play yard because there is much more room for toys and for baby.  As she grew (and the number of toys as well), I purchased an extension to make the area bigger.  It was great for both indoor and outdoor use.  We also used it to block the large open area between our kitchen and family room that no other gate would be large enough to cover.  Now that winter is here and she is running about, we are using it to block our wood(pellet) stove to prevent any accidents.  We also plan on using it around our Christmas tree again this year. Other reviews have complained that it is not sturdy or difficult to set up.  I have never had a problem and it folds up and stores easily.  Well worth it for it's versatility.",4
Supergate III,"We purchased this gate to mount between a wall & wrought iron railing at the top of a staircase.  We had a difficult time trying to find a gate that could be mounted in these conditions so we were excited to find this one.My husband installed the gate after having to purchase new screws because the ones that came with the gate were really short & stripped easy in the iron railing.Our gate isn't sturdy at all.  In fact, it seems pretty flimsy....and it is installed correctly.  I wouldn't trust it to hold the weight of my (17 lb) daughter if she were to stand up and lean on it.  We will keep it up until we can find a replacement.I think it would be ok if it wasn't mounted at the top of the stairs.  Someone had mentioned in a previous review that it was easy to climb and I can see how that would be the case.  The little holes are perfect little steps.Bottom line, I would not recommend this gate for the top of a stairway.  Just in a hallway...may be ok but I'm sure you could find better.  Pretty disappointing.",2
North States Industries Superyard XT Gate Extension,"If you buy the Superyard XT, buy this.  Without it, the yard is too small.  It's a GREAT, sturdy product, well worth the extra couple bucks!",5
North States Industries Superyard XT Gate Extension,"I can't say enough good things about this product.  I have a very open floor plan so it was impossible to block areas off for my toddler.  I always felt guilty when I had to clean or do anything that would take me away because he would cry from being confined to the play yard, but now he has space to roam in and I can go about my daily routine knowing that he is in a safe environment and is happy to have all that space.  I don't feel as though I am confining my child anymore, just keeping him safe. He has a large area to play in and I am able to get other things done and give my older child some undivided attention.  I have thought about buying another superyard XT and doubling his play area, but I will give this extention kit a shot first.  I can't wait until summer to take him out I have an umbrella and stand that I think will work great to keep him shaded but allow him time outdoors.  If there is a babys r us in your area buy it there it will save you quite a bit on shipping.",5
North States Industries Superyard XT Gate Extension,"This product is not sturdy enough. It is good up to about 14 months and then after that it wasn't as useful. Concept is great, but not functional for me.",2
North States Industries Superyard XT Gate Extension,"I bought this in addition to the super play yard, and foam mat to make a large play area for my twins.  Love it.",5
North States Industries Superyard XT Gate Extension,"I used this extension on an already existing Superyard XT.  It takes a little extra strength to join together, but it locks in nice and extended the smaller ""pen"" to a nice size.",5
North States Industries Superyard XT Gate Extension,"I have never written a review before, but I felt compelled to do so now.  I have the superyard. It is awesome, I am here to buy the extension kit now.  My son is fast, into everything, and he would definately have been injured now without this thing.  It is great.  It keeps him safe, keeps me sane, and keeps the rest of the house safe too. I have a 30 gallon aquarium I need to get a new stand for because I am terrified he would pull the thing down.  With this I dont have to worry. He ruined our stereo speakers and I dont have to worry about that anymore.  We rent a very old house that is almost impossible to childproof properly, and it is so cluttered, I hate to put him in a cage, but since I have no choice, this is perfect. He has plenty of OPEN space, I don't feel so bad now. Play pens and play yards were useless, the child cannot learn to walk in those things. This way he is on the ground, living and learning to live like the rest of us, only he is safe. I reccommend it for everyone.  No one parent should be without it. It is much better than chasing your child all day and saying no, doorway gates cannot compare to this, he is just safe from everything.  One thing though. Kmart online has it ten dollars cheaper. The actual system that is. This two piece extension is cheaper here right now, and I have a gift certificate.  I can see where this would work for pups too.  It is a bit of a pain to put together though, but well worth it, so I dont complain!",5
North States Industries Superyard XT Gate Extension,"My mother-in-law suggested we get my son a larger play pen so he can have more room to crawl and walk.  I thought this item would be too large in my home, but even though it is larger than the standard playpens, it's wonderful.  We just keep it over our area rug.  He can easily see through it, and the best part is.. the dog can't get him.  The other plus... when we go out... it can be easily moved over to our tiled floor area for the dog.  There is only one down side.  Your rug area needs to be well padded, if your child is just learning to stand, because if they fall and hit their head on the ground, it can hurt them.",4
North States Industries Superyard XT Gate Extension,"After waiting an additional 3 weeks from the time I got the Superyard, I tried to fit the extension onto the Superyard as it was much needed. IT DIDN'T WORK! I guess you are supposed to get 2 of the extensions, but I still don't see how they would fit. Neither myself or my husband could figure out how to connect the extension to the superyard; nothing we tried worked. (And yes, we read the directions) As soon as I can figure out how to return this thing, it's going back! It was a waste, as was the Superyard....",1
North States Industries Superyard XT Gate Extension,"I just had to review this great product!  We bought the superyard when my youngest son was 6 months old (he's now 2 1/2).  It worked GREAT with him but it has had much more use also!  I used it about a year ago for my two Golden Retrievers when they were puppies to keep them from destroying my house when inside and to contain them when outside since we live on 5 acres with no fence.  And now, I'm using it for our latest animal addition, a 2 month old Dutch bunny -- it's great to use inside or outside with it also.  I'm getting either the extension or another superyard to give him more room since he will be using it for a long time hopefully.  Just thought I'd let everyone know how very useful this item is!!",5

Thomas &amp; Friends - 3 Piece Dinnerware Set- Pecoware,"I brought this as a gift for a friend's son because he loves the Thomas character. It seems to be a pretty nice purchase.

Thomas &amp; Friends - 3 Piece Dinnerware Set- Pecoware,"These dishes are pretty and fun for little Thomas fans, but if you have a ceramic tile floor, beware!  Cup broke on 1st use!  Pecoware did replace it for me, though, but I had to do a fair amount of e-mail exchanges before that happened.",3
Thomas &amp; Friends - 3 Piece Dinnerware Set- Pecoware,"Very nice 3 piece set.  Pictures on each piece are very detailed and nicer quality than most childs sets.  I would buy again but due to the high quality, I don't think I will need to.  It recommends washing on top rack of dishwasher.",5
Thomas &amp; Friends - 3 Piece Dinnerware Set- Pecoware,"It's Thomas - so isn't it obvious?  Good quality plastic dishes, and she always wants them - I should have bought 3 sets!",5
Thomas &amp; Friends - 3 Piece Dinnerware Set- Pecoware,I bought this set as a gift for my grandson and he was so excited when he opened it.  The next couple of days the only thing he wanted to have his food on was his Thomas the Train dinnerware.  Very durable.,5

Playskool Walk 'N Sounds Digger the Dog Children's Pull Toy,"My kids are all drawn to this toy and love the idea of ""walking"" the dog.  But it doesn't stay up when you pull it, so it drags on the side and is all scratched up.  Did playskool ever even try this out??? They get frustrated. It's in the trash pile, wouldn't want to even donate.",1
Playskool Walk 'N Sounds Digger the Dog Children's Pull Toy,"This dog is nothing like the original.  I had a digger the dog over 20 years ago and that is why I wanted this for my son. The one I had was big enough to pull over, through and around anything!  This one is so little and light it, plus the pull string is on the top/middle, so when it is pulled by a one year old it just topples over, even if he pulls it on a hard smooth surface.  The only enjoyment he gets out of it is by pulling the string to get it to make the noises.",2
Music Blocks Baby Maestro Opera Cartridge,"With city sounds, animal sounds, orchestra and vocal doing the ""La Donna e Mobile"" who would think that a 2-year old would prefer the man's singing?  Indeed, she also enjoys the chuckle immensely, but when I put the entire song on the stereo for her, she was thrilled.  She still asks frequently for the ""man singing"" -- over her Sesame street songs and other children's music.  We love this toy and this is probably the cartridge we use the most, with Jazz being our second favorite.",5
Music Blocks Baby Maestro Opera Cartridge,This one keeps cracking us up. My two year old mimics some of the song (the chuckle part). This one is my personal favorite so far.,5
Ship Ahoy Sorter,"I purchased this toy for my 14 month old son. He started to play with it before I had even taken it out of the box. Now it is the first toy that he goes to in the morning when he gets up. His favorite shape is the circle, because he can put it in by himself. The door on the front does pull off very easily, I yanked it off by accident when we were first playing with the toy, but I have since taken it off for good because it is easier for my son to get the shapes back out. This is a good &quot;busy&quot; toy.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I love this toy and so does my baby. I was worried at first, there didn't seem to be much interest, but now older, baby loves it!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I was looking for a ~$20 gift for a co-workers kid's first birthday and this looked highly rated.I gave it to the co-worker on a Friday to take to the party on Saturday and told him to let me know how it goes.  On Monday he said his son enjoyed it so far and the noises aren't super annoying or repetitive so it shouldn't drive him crazy any time soon.This seems like a very safe gift to give someone if you aren't sure what they are interested in.Recommended.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I got it based on reviews and I am glad I did.  My now-7-month-old son likes it though not as much as another musical toy.  The only downside of this toy as far as I can see - which was also pointed out by other reviewers - is that sound is very unnatural - I was surprised even though I was expecting it.  Think of an old cell phone with musical ringer.,4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,lights up and teaches music fundamentals at an early age. It's not too annoying like some other sound gadgets are.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,This is a great musical toy for all ages! Our granddaughter loves hers.She  received hers at birth and continues to use this at 2 years. I recommend this to all babies and toddlers!,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This was a Christmas present for my 9 month old. 8 months later it stays tucked in the toybox never to be played with. Maybe this would be better for a really young baby? He plays with it for about 5 seconds then gets bored. My 3 year old was never interested in it. The music is pleasant, and it is durable.",2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I bought this for my 2 year old and was hesitant that it might be too young for her, but she loves music and she loves this cube!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"my son, who is now almost 18 mos. old, loves his mozart cube. he has played with this toy since christmas when we got it for him. most days he'll play in the living room and he'll play his mozart cube then go on to explore other toys...when the music stops he comes back to his cube to play it again! we're hoping that musical influences like this cube will encourage him to want to learn music.this cube is well constructed and lights up when the instrument blocks are playing. we liked the mozart cube enough to buy one for my sister and our best friend who are both pregnant!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"While this is a noise-making toy, it is a pleasure to hear. I play with it almost as much as my children. It is a lot of fun to hear the different pieces, and to hear how the different instruments blend in or are removed at the touch of a button. It is sturdy and holds up very well to the abuses of a toddler.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Both of my twins LOVE this toy! I really like how you can add/subtract the different instruments as the song plays. I did find it interesting that they enjoy one of the songs more than others and will keep pressing the orchestra button until they find the song the like. I think it's a good way to start to introduce them to music.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I gave this to my 1 year old grandson at Christmas.  He spent more time with this than anything else.  He was fasinated by the various sounds and combinations of sounds---even his older siblings (ages 2-4) wanted to play with it.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This was given to my two year old nephew as a birthday gift.  At first it would not work.  After determining it was not the batteries a little detective work found that the battery casing was not made correctly.  If it was screwed in to tight it would not work.  So this musical cube now works and itself is a great item, the music and intruments heard.  But if you touch the battery compartment it stops working and how do you tell a two year old not to handle the cube.  A+ for the item and c- for the toys construction.",3
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This was given to my son, as a gift, when he turned 1.  He is now 17 months old and it has been his favorite.  At first, he carried it everywhere around the house, hardly ever put it down.  Now he runs off and plays, but goes back to press the buttons so he can hear the music as he plays.  He even sleeps with it everynight and it is what finally gets him off to la-la land!  I would highly recommend this.  My husband is a musician and thinks it is the greatest also!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My baby loves music and lights and this toy is a perfect combination.  This keeps my baby entertained with music for quite some time.  He loves that he can move the cube in his hands without any help from Mom.  The buttons to activate the music and light are also easy to push.  He will stare, fascinated at the lights and sound.  If you want your child to appreciate music, this is a fantasic toy.  This is my favorite toy for my son and I find it to be priceless.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I liked this for my 6 month old son because it plays music and lights up. You can also press a couple of the buttons together or seperate and it plays together. It's neat and my son enjoys it.,4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,This toy seemed very well liked and is recommended on many toy homepages in the Top Ten Toys. I had high hopes but my little boy just doesn't seem interested. We received it early on and I think he liked the sounds of it somewhat. He is now almost 14 months and doesn't really play with it unless he is prompted by  me. Even then he'll only shortly press some buttons and then usually starts picking it up and throwing it. This thing is heavy for a little person and I'm afraid that it could hit his foot or smash through our french doors. I thought it might just take him a little while and that he would be interested as he grows older but so far we could have done without it.,2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This toy is our son's favorite! I like the different musical options it has, and the very nicely rounded corners. It lights up but not in a super-fast, annoying way that so many baby toys do. It's very solid (has been dropped on the floor many times) and an overall quality toy. Two thumbs way up!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"We're on our second one -- the first didn't work out of the box (which would have been a letdown for a child older than our toddler son). The replacement worked fine and has generally been a source of delight for our family (dad loves playing it, too!). For mom and dad, though, this toy has become a disappointment. The manufacturer has tried really hard to make this a tough toy and we salute them for that.  But after little more than a year, one button has died and the toy has a tendency to decide it ""doesn't feel like playing today"" even with brand-new batteries. Yes, toys wear out. But for the steep price, we expected much more.  In short: A great musical / educational toy, but not built to last.  Not a great value.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"The Mozart Magic Cube was given to my infant daughter as a Christmas gift--she loves it! Perfect for little hands as they are learning coordination and motor skills.  It is fun to listen to the songs and isolate the different instruments or add them back in, one by one.  The rubber sides are durable, especially if dropped.  Nice, also, to have no sharp edges on it, so it is very safe.  My 11 month old niece was over to play and she discovered the cube and was enchanted by it.  I will be giving her one for her very own for her upcoming birthday!  As for the loudness level, I  don't find it terribly loud; however, I recognize it needs to be at a certain level in order for babies to focus in on it (if it were softer, they might not pay attention to it).",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I bought this Mozart magic cube last Christmas for my son.  He is now 14 months old, and he has loved this thing since he was about six months old.  I just bought one for another baby in my family... she is eight months old.  My son loves to smack the buttons to make the cube play different songs, and he's always quite intrigued when he hits one of the instrument buttons that makes, for instance, the drum sound go away or the piano sound rejoin the song.  It's a hit at my house!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I bought this for my 4-month old son. He is very fussy baby but when I played the music on this cube, he loved it. The best sounds he liked were the flute, piano and the Orchestra. The Best thing about this Music cube is that you can play one instrument at a time and then the final orchestra one to kind of show the music-mix.I believe it will help develop my baby's musical skills.Cons: The battery didn't last long. We used it for 30 days, for about 10 min each day and the battery died down!",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My 4-month-old loves her music cube!  The musical instrument sounds, while not EXACTLY right, sound very close to the actual instruments.  I was expecting to have an electronic, slightly robotic sound, and I was pleasantly surprised.  The colors and lights are very engaging, and even my two-year-old will pick this one up to play with it!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"We bought this last year for Christmas for our (then) 18-month-old. She loved it, but the real surprise was last month when our 10-month-old discovered it. To say he loved it would be a real understatement!! He loves to crawl around after it and will play with it for 30 minutes at a time--amazing for a baby to play with something for that long.The music is a pleasure to listen to, especially compared with most musical baby toys. Like the other reviewers, I would have liked the addition of a volume control, but otherwise this toy is perfect. The batteries even seem to last a very long time. I was amazed that my 2-1/2 year old and 10-month-old can be mesmerized by the same toy.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Our grand daughter is 5 and a half months old. She absolutely LOVES this musical toy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! She pushes the center of each square with her fingers and toes...adorable. Each side plays a different instrument! I highly recommend this toy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Toy is nice sound and sturdy. One yr old has learned to differentiate which sound he wants within two weeks. Great!,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This has been a favorite toy of my daughter, now 2.5, since she got it as a baby.  The music is engaging and soothing to her, and wonderfully not annoying to the grown-ups (like so many music toys can be).",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"my granddaughter loves this, seems to really understand the different functions of the different buttons. the sounds are different from each button and are pleasing alone or in combination with other buttons.  i gave this to her when she was six months old, and she is now quite proficient with all the buttons at age eight months.  the sound is not annoying, either, as some of the sounds of toys are.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Our 11 month old daughter has LOVED this musical toy since the day we brought it home four months ago. She entertains herself and us by pressing the various instrument panels. She also enjoys watching the lights. The only drawback I can see is that it needs a volume switch.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,My 18 mos. old granddaughter just loved it & figured it out immediately! She carries it around & dances to the music.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,This toys plays beautiful classical music.  The child can choose which instruments to have playing or can use the entire orchestra.  It is pretty entertaining for the adults also :)  Much nicer also than many noisy toys.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"our cub adores this little music maker...it is extremely easy for him to operate and very well made (has survived many, many episodes of the babe flinging it from his crib)....the colors are interesting yet muted and the music pieces are lively but also lovely....very nice toy for baby and toddler....",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Purchased this because my 16 month old son loves music and this product has amazing reviews. Gave it to my son for Christmas and he is completely uninterested in it. . . I am disappointed,2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I am pretty sure I love it more than the baby! So much fun and at a great price on here. Baby laughs as I play!!,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I'm really not sure why so many people writing the review for this product are a.) being incredibly elitist about it vs. the older product by Embryonics that no longer exists and b.) complaining about the sound quality.Perhaps some of these parents expected the toy to be extremely loud and obnoxious like some Tickle Me Elmo doll, but I personally don't have a problem with the sound quality. Since it is made for close contact/play, it makes sense that this product wouldn't be so loud that I could hear it a mile away. And to be honest, the sound quality really isn't bad at all for what it is.This toy is very colorful and my son (who is only just turning 4 months old), while not really interested in toys yet, holds a fascination for listening to this thing make its noises. If I put it at his feet, he will kick it just to make it turn on. He really seems to enjoy it, even if he doesn't have quite enough strength yet to really push the buttons on his own. The construction seems pretty solid (I would almost be afraid that my kid could brain himself with this item if he were strong enough to pick it up) and it came included with batteries already installed.Children have the option of pushing one side of the cube to listen to it or adding in the sounds from other sides to create a cacophony of sound. There is also, of course, the orchestra button. If you push the button twice, it turns that particular instrument off so you can hear the other instruments. It lights up but I kind of wish it lit up more as you can barely see it in well-lit rooms.About the only complaint I really have is that some of the instruments don't sound anything like what the represented instrument should sound like. The violin for example sounds suspiciously like an oboe and the piano sounds remarkably like a harpsichord. However, I am not so elitist that I wouldn't let my kid play with this because the sounds are different than what I would expect them to be. I realize that most people cannot discern the differences in the sounds of like instruments in most cases unless they have had a background in music education, so it's really not a big deal. If he enjoys it, then that is ultimately what matters.However, I am giving this product 4 out of 5 stars because of this discrepancy as well as the fact that the French horn (while also sounding off) sounds really, really weak compared to the other instruments on the cube. The other instruments seem very clear and concise and yet, I can barely hear the French horn.But, my son seems to enjoy it so far (and as I mentioned, he doesn't seem to care much for toys yet) and to me, that is worth the money in the end.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"The music is pleasant, though sometimes gets stuck on the same piece over and over. 7-mo-old likes to hit the squares, but the same song just starts over again with each strike. The toy just isn't as versatile as I'd imagined. Quite limited. Sound quality is rather harsh, also.",3
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,My 1-year-old grandson really loves this.  He is already very fond of music and this allows him to change the sound using all the different combinations available on the cube and he is listening to Mozart while doing so....doesn't get much better than that.  It's very easy for a young child to manipulate and there are no small parts to worry about.  I highly recommend this.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Great toy! My daughter loves it! It is incredible to me that it does so much for so small a price.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Has 8 recognizable tunes and easy enough for our 9 month old to figure out. Nice silicone-esque edging makes it easy to grip and keeps from sliding.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,My one year old son enjoys music. He was thrilled to play with this. Pushing the buttons to hear all the different sounds. Plus my 3 year old likes to play with the cube also. It gives them a chance to play together.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This is bright, sturdy and has great music.  It's a nice concept - conducting your own symphony, so to speak.  It has not maintained my one year old daughter's attention for very long, but that may be because it was a Christmas present and there are other things that she is more interested in right now.  I love the rubber balls on the corners and the bright colors.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My grandson loves to fall asleep while listening to either religious or classical  music.  When I was shopping on Amazon.com for Christmas presents, I ran across this Mozart Magic Cube.  I liked the colors, listened to the songs and read the posted reviews.  The price was acceptable so I purchased it.When my daughter opened the present for him, he immediately picked it up and smiled.  He must have liked the colors.  Then I turned the music on for him and received an even bigger smile!  It now stays in his crib with him, so he can fall asleep to his favorite tunes.Thank you, Amazon, for carrying this product!  Debby Pate",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I use this item when I'm working with students (preschoolers), especially those who are multi disabled.  I have to assist them to push individual interments but I really like the music (sound).",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My son received this toy when he was about 3 months old, although he didn't become interest in it until he was about 8 months old.  Now (he's 18 months old) he carries it around with him from room to room wherever I am to play the symphony for me.  He loves to push those buttons!  This toy plays about 7 different songs, and my son has certain ones he just loves and dance to.  The whole orchestra can play or you can push buttons on and off during the song to have only the piano or french horn play together or by themselves.  It's great, I wish it took bigger batteries so I wouldn't have to replace them so often.  There is a volum control but it only has two settings.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My 18 month old son loves his cube.  He experiments with the different instruments and tunes.  Anything with buttons and lights is a hit, so adding music is just icing on the cake.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,It's neat but my 18 month old son doesn't like it much. He actually sometimes complains about it and wants me to just turn it off.,2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,something different  nice,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,best baby toy there is 6 month old loves it she loves to grab it and wakes up singing because of it,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"After reading several reviews of this toy, I purchased it for my 5 month old son.  He spends a couple hours, everyday scooting around in his walker.  The Magic Cube is a fixture on the tray of his scooter.  While investigating all the rooms he will touch instruments on the Cube and make it play.  As always, when the Cube falls off of his walker he stops in his tracks and cries until either my wife or I pick it back up and put it on his tray again; then he's off to the next wonder of the house.  It will be interesting to see how he evolves with the interaction of this toy.  I'm glad I made this purchase.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Received a item that seems to be used for a long time.Its outward condition was bad as if it were used for a long time.if it's the new one, because of its improper package seems it to be old and used.I don't recommend this to anyone now.",1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,This is a must for any baby. My son is 1 year old and loves all the different music and instruments. It's also easy for your little one to push the big buttons.  The only thing I don't like about this product is that there is no volume control.  Other than that it's a good solid toy.,4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My daughter LOVES this toy.We first gave it to her at 6 months for Christmas, which was too early. She wasn't strong enough to push the button herself, so she didn't really like it. Around 8 months or so, she started liking it. The more she figures out how it works, the more the likes it. At 11 months, she plays with it all the time. Now she's strong enough to lift it, so she hands it to us to play.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Totally love it--it was for a gift, but I couldn't stop using it myself!  The song keeps playing while you add or subtract instruments--what a great way to show children the different instrumental sounds!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"All of the great reviews of this product encouraged me to purchase it and I'm so glad I did!  This will be a birthday present for my daughter (who, by the way, won't have her 1st birthday until November), but I wanted to make sure that we have educational toys for her, and this truly is very musically educational.  A great toy to incorporate the elements of instrumental music.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"As the father of a four-month old daughter, and someone who has studied music from the age of 4, I was thrilled to play with this toy, and spent over 30 minutes playing with it myself. The sound quality isn't great -- it's true (think midi instruments from your standard cheap composition software), but the idea is fantastic. There are numerous songs, each with harp, piano, flute, french horn, and violin parts. You can listen to any combination of those parts on any song. Although it's a bit much for a four-month old, I'm sure she'll enjoy it as much (or more!) than I do.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,This is a very versatile toy- it's small and simple enough for an infant to play with. Then as the child ages and becomes more aware of different noises he/she can experiment with combining various musical instruments.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I BOUGHT THIS TOY FOR MY THEN 1 YEAR DAUGHTER WHOS NOW 18 MONTHS BECAUSE SHE SAW IT IN A STORE AND REFUSED TO LET IT GO BECAUSE OF THE MUSIC I AM GLAD I BOUGHT IT 20 BUCKS WELL SPENT ONCE OUT OF THE STORE SHE HAS NOT PARTED FROM IT SINCE UNTIL SHE DROPPED IT FROM HER HIGH CHAIR AND WE THOUGHT IT BROKE BUT I REMOVED THE BATTERIES CLEANED IT WITH ALCOHOL AND ITS BRAND NEW AND SHE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER THIS TOY IS AMAZING AND SHE LOVES HEARING THE SONG IN DIFFERENT WAYS ESPECIALLY THE ORCHESTRA ITS LIKE HER SECURITY BLANKET JUS A TOY INSTEAD. THIS TOY IS VERY MUCH RECOMMENDED I WILL BE BUYING THE SING ALONG I JUST BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE FOR MY 8 MONTH OLD NEPHEW AND HE LOVES IT,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,my kids love this music cube.  they love it so much that I started to get this product for my friends' children or babies.  the music and the lights keep them entertained.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My just turned year old grandson, Eli, received this from us for his birthday and immediately started playing with it.  It's one of his favorite toys!  I highly recommend its play value.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,The Mozart magic cube is an AWESOME toy for my busy little 15 month old boy.  It's one of the VERY few toys he will stop and play with.  He has always loved music from a young age.  He like to hit the various buttons and it is small enough for him to carry around.  It also can take lots of abuse.  My 4 year old daughter will play with it as well.  Really a classic must have for babies and toddlers.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My 4-5 month old baby loves this toy.  It is very easy to press the buttons and activate the sounds, so even very young, uncoordinated babies can get this toy to make noise.  As she gets older, she can use the cube to learn about different kinds of sounds and about colors.  For now, though, she just likes to chew on the corners and is delighted whenever the music starts playing.I am giving this four stars instead of five because the cube is secured to its packaging with wire-like pieces of plastic that protrude from the toy.  It is actually very difficult (and maybe impossible) to remove these pieces entirely from the toy, and that presents a danger of poked eyes and scratches.  Eventually, we had to cut the plastic ties very close to the toy and then push the raw ends into the toy, where they still are (and we hope they stay there).  There seems to be no way to remove them entirely.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,My son got this for his first birthday and he hasn't stopped playing with it.  He loves the music and has started dancing to all the songs.  If the cube is out of reach he will even point at it and start dancing.  It was so easy for him to figure out.  He carries it around room to room so that it always nearby for music.  He has thrown it several times and it was not damaged. I am going to start buying this toy as a gift for other babies and toddlers because I am positive they would enjoy it also.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I bought the Mozart Magic Cube 3 years ago for our grandkids' toybox at our home. This past summer, one of the little ones left this outside - of course it rained. When we found it the next day we thought the cube was finished as it was completely silent (I have no idea why I didn't throw it out). After a few months it surprised us and started making music again. It still looks and works like new - even after spending a night in the rain and after 3 years of abuse from a large contingent of young grandchildren. The kids - from the babies to 8 years - continue to enjoy playing with it.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I'm grandma and I purchased the Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube for my grandbaby. It is precious. The bright colors light up and the music is beautiful. I love the way my grandbaby can choose various instruments to play the melody.I give this toy 5 stars. It was worth purchasing.Enjoy!,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,this was just as advertised.  Perfect forlittle fingers.  Quite nice toy withlovely sound quality and bright colorsand flashing lights.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My 11 month old grandson loved this toy -- dances to it with smiles all over.  His big brother (9) wants to play with it too, having a greater understanding of the instruments.  Their dad, 39, liked the option of adding or subtracting instruments from the mix.  Good tunes, good fun.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This is a great transitional toy. We've had it since my son was tiny - as an infant, he liked to look at the lights and colors. At 18 months, he dances to the music and loves pressing the buttons. I don't think he fully gets the concept of adding and removing instruments to the orchestra yet, so once he figures that out, we'll have many more months of fun with the music cube. The music is pleasant - my only complaint is that it only has one volume setting.One word of caution, if you have a climber - this toy makes a great stepping stool for toddlers who like to climb out of their cribs. :)We love the music cube - highly recommend it!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,My son loves this toy and so do I :) it lights up to the tune of each song. great toy!,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Like it very much,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,My daugther loves this. She sits there dancing to the music.  I also love it...I just wish I could adjust the volume sometimes.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"The fabulous Munhkin Mozart Magic Cube was given to our friend's daughter when she was an infant. From a very early age, we watched in amazement as she responded to the sounds of the music, obviously recognizing changes. We could see the pleasure on her face. As time went on, she played with the toy herself and was constantly drawn to it.There was always a limited assortment of toys for her to explore on the living room floor. She loved to play with some more than others. However, she was always constantly drawn back to this -- the sounds of the music from different instruments was a great source of fascination.As she gets older, the way that she handles Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube becomes more selective and sophisticated. This is one of the best toys we have ever seen to develop delight in music!She is beginning to talk now, and I feel certain that her first words will be, ""GET ME A HARPSICHORD NOW!!""Love it!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My son (now 19 months) got this one last Christmas, and a year later it is still going strong.  Not only does he still enjoy it, mom & dad still enjoy it.  That is, it's music is pleasant enough that it doesn't give us a headache -- can't say that about a lot of these electronic toys.  Quite a deal for $15.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Our daughter got this toy for her first birthday.  It was an instant hit not only with her but with her dad and grandfather!  Great music selection, brilliant interaction (being able to add instruments to the song is an awesome feature), extremely durable (our daughter immediately stood on it, which didn't affect it in the least).  Only downside is the sound quality, which even for a kid's toy is pretty awful.  All of the sounds are really tinny and scratchy.  The piano and harp are decent reproductions, but the violin, french horn and clarinet are all shoddy electronic noises that bear little resemblance to the actual instruments.  Overall, though, it's a great toy.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My daughter got this for her first birthday today and she loves it!!  I know the newness will probably wear out eventually, but for now, it's probably her favorite thing from her birthday.  My 2 year old also loves it!  And I love it because the music is fairly pretty (for a kid's toy).  It's not annoying and not too loud either.  Great toy!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My one year old son has played with this toy since he was 6 months old and it still entertains him.  While the instruments do sound a bit synthetic, the toy still provides an introduction to different instruments and how multiple instruments can create a complex music piece.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My husband and I gave this toy to our son for his 1st birthday.  What a GREAT toy.  He loves it, and so does his 4-year old brother.  They play with it every day, many times a day.  The music is a nice change from the usual nursery rhymes, and we haven't grown tired of listening to it.  A really terrific toy!!!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,My son loves to dance to music now. He received this for his 1st birthday and it was an instant hit. He quickly learn how to work it and he still loves to play with it at 20 months old.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I bought this product as I was looking for some alternative toys for my 7.5 mo son, so he cld play/hear music when he wakes up in the morning in crib, instead of trying to stand up all the times.I love the product after reading reviews, love the rounded corner, love the design that baby has to play all by HIMSELF!  My boy totally enjoyed it for the first couple days and could sat and played for 20 to 30 min, it totally amazed me.  Until one day I found him, after playing the cube for 15 min, covering his ears and trying to escape.  I turned the cube off and he's happy again, then I realized the cube could TOO loud/noisy for infant.Different from most of other musical toys that have volume options, this one does NOT and its volume was definitely on the higher side, which might not be too good for infant, especially when it was designed for &#34;all ages&#34; - 0 month +.Anyhow, I'm still using it to buy myself a little bit time in the morning, but I don't let him to play for more than 5 min, that would be my temporary solution for now.",3
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This is a wonderful product. It will keep the baby interested and won't annoy you with horrible singing and songs like many of the other baby toys that light up and play music. In fact, it's Mozart, so it's actually pleasant and enjoyable. Will listening to Mozart or the individual instruments' parts make your baby smarter? Of course not, but it will be enjoyed by all.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This was holiday gift mailed to small granchild.  Our first Munchkin cube, now broken, was a popular toy w several local grandkids  It no longer holds interest since the on/off button ceased working. We have been unable to make permanent fix. When working, the cube is brightly lit, colorful, instruments are depicted on faces of cube, & when pressed, play solos. The &#34;orchestra&#34; face, when pressed, plays all instruments together as &#34;orchestra&#34;. It is a nicer toy & decently priced.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Just received this toy for my daughter's first birthday. She loves it. It keeps her attention, which is quite hard to do. It has beautiful music and its neat how the different instruments can be turned on and off without skipping a note in the music.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Our 8 month old loves to &#34;bang&#34; things so this is perfect. He moves it around, bangs on it and lights it up with music. Great buy!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Not the best toy. We bought this for our 1 year old and while this is a great IDEA for a musical toy, it could be SO much better. The biggest problem is the instrument sounds. None of them are great, but some are really awful. The worst is the violin sound - it sounds nasal, fake, and is terribly grating. It may be ok for the child, but for the parents, remember that you have to hear these over and over every time the kid pushes a button. I have no idea why Munchkin didn't just use real instrument recordings. Sounds like they chose the first MIDI instruments they found and called it a day.Also, this may just be our son, but he isn't that into the toy. Funny story though...We were at the store today looking for a shower gift for another baby and our son found a similar toy by Baby Einstein - same idea with instruments you can turn on and off. He loved it. We had to take it away from him so we could go, he was having so much fun with it. The sounds were less grating as well on that one. It looks like a turtle, if you're interested.",2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,We were given this toy as a gift for my first son. It has survived three small children and needed only its batteries changed. It is fascinating for young ones and will delight them with its changing lights and music. As a gift or for your own child you can not go wrong.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Like it very much, also very suitable for me, will come again next time, have a preferential activities to inform me.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,She LOVES this toy.  Keeps her attention totally.  It was one of the first things she went for Christmas morning.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Several years ago we purchased a Mozart Magic Cube for a grandchild. After that child and 3 additional siblings played with it, it finally gave up. Child # 6 is a year old and another baby is on the way, we bought the same toy for this family. It was Cha Cha's Favorite toy, along with a small giraffe. She took the two gifts, and went across the room and played with them while all the other children continued to open their packages. Can't recommend this toy enough. It plays Classical songs in the voices of different instruments and is obviously well constructed.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I often search for toys with great ratings on Amazon.  This one is another great buy.  My 7 month old daughter loves playing with it.  She plays with this simple cube more that most every other toy.  I would definitely recommend this for the 6-12 month age range.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,My son really liked this toy. I was a really great teething toy for him to bite on also it has many other things to keep in interested,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Super cool toy that my baby absolutely loves but within a week the batteries need replacing, and he's not playing it every day... Sadly now he's not playing it at all, out of batteries!",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I may like this toy more than my daughter. My favorite thing is to do a bit of orchestration by adding and subtracting the various instruments. I do find the tone of the piano mildly discordant and usually remove it from all of the tunes.As for baby, this toy is great for putting an end to the occasional crying jag. She presses the buttons easily. I don't think she's got it all figured out yet, but it's one of her favorite toys. We also love the soft rounded corners on this toy.  I've seen my daughter giving them a nibble now and then.The cube is durable. My baby often pulls it off the shelf to send it thudding to the floor and it still works.It is a bit big and rather heavy for a child to carry.  However, my only real complaint is the packaging. When I received the cube, it was fastened in with plastic coated wires that ran through holes in the cube. I cut them with scissors at first only to have them stuck in the cube. I finally wrapped the remainder around a letter opener and pulled it free. The cube comes with no instructions on removing these wires.Quick mention: You'll need a screwdriver to install the batteries.5 stars. Great toy. Neat concept. I think my daughter will grow to love this toy more over time.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,the music is very lovely.i also love this music box and my daughter is also.you can hear the 8 song. the mozart.and you can play a 5 music instrument.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My daughter received this for her first birthday.  She absolutely loves it.  She's 16 months old now, and it has become her favorite toy.  She will climb into her toy box, over all her other stuff, to get to it.  It keeps her busy for a good 20 minutes at a time while she experiments with all the different songs and musical instrument sounds.  We still haven't had to replace the batteries, which is a definite plus!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"We got this as a free gift for my twins' first birthday at a secondhand store. They loved it instantly and have enjoyed it ever since. Now it is our 6 month old baby's favorite toy. The baby likes to push the buttons and the girls dance to the music, so it's been a great toy that they can all use together.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I wish I could give this cube 5 stars! If it were based on how much our twins adored the toy, I would definitely give it a better rating! However, I feel the need to mention that we initially purchased this toy for our 6+ mos old twins and within a few months the battery cover cracked right next to the on/off switch, leaving the batteries easily accessible. Duct tape would not even keep the cover on securely, because the cover was under so much pressure from the batteries and springs underneath.When our twins were 1 1/2 we decided to put it on the Christmas wish list, because they both adored the first one so much. Much to our dismay, the exact same thing happened to the battery cover of the second one!What a huge disappointment! Obviously this toy has a manufacturing defect and I can only hope that Munchkin fixes it for future production of the toy. The concept is excellent and our twins really did love it, especially our very musical little girl.",2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Fine toy, nice sound.  Much better than most other musical toys.  But I can't give it to my son yet as I can't seem to get these damned wires from the packaging out of the toy.  They are threaded through these tiny holes in the product and I haven't yet gone out to get pliers as someone else suggested.  You shouldn't need pliers to free a toy from its packaging.  Obviously the manufacturer didn't receive the memo that we are pushing for frustration free packaging. I even took out the screws that access the battery pack (which I am quite impressed with as well), hoping to access where the wires are stuck.  No luck.  If they just used regular string, it would easily come out, but these plastic coated wires are too stiff to pull through in the manner that they have put them.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"We were given this product for a gift - from our wishlist - for our, at the time, 12 month old daughter. She loved it, and carried it around everywhere. One day, she dropped it. She was 29 inches tall. It was in her hands and fell no more than 15 inches. It broke. Saddened, we contacted the CS department to see about getting it fixed. We were told too bad - it fell.So, basically, a toy made for young children can't fall any distance, and was not under a warranty because of the fall and would not be fixed. Therefore, I will never buy anything from this unrealistic company again. If you make kid's toys, you might want to make them kid durable.",1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My son is now just over a year and has had this toy for about 6 months. I bought this because he loved the baby einstein take along tunes toy and thought this would be similar type music and activity. The sound is horrible! Every instrument sound is extremely screechy. I am not sure if I just have a bad product, but I feel like I wasted my money on this.",1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I bought this cube for my son when he was about 6 months old.  He's now 18 months.  He loved the toy then and still plays with it now.  Even though his absolute favorite activity these days is pushing toys around on the floor and climbing on furniture, he still will sit and play with his cube.  It's the only toy from his infancy that he still enjoys.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Bought this a year ago for my 18 month old. I also had a 3 year old at the time. They have played with it off and on. Enough to run the batteries down once a year later. We have a new baby and now he's messing with it some. Not a huge hit.,3
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Our son 5 month old son loves things that light up and play music, which is why we bought this for him. He likes to look at it, but hasn't figured out how to push the buttons on his own yet. The buttons are sensitive, so they will be easy for him to push once he figures it out. Overall, this is a pretty cool toy.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This is a very well made and creative learning toy/tool. It plays a variety of tunes very well. A lot more pleasing to the ear than most of the noise makes around. The genius however, is that you can add or remove the five instruments while they are playing. Make your own combo, quintet, quartet, trio, duet, or solo, in any combination. That should keep your rug rat busy for a while, it did me.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My daughter got both the Mozart Magic Cube and the Sing-a-long Cube for Christmas this year, and we love them both!  I am a music teacher, and I think these are just really cool musical toys for young children.  The sound is much better than I expected, and my daughter loves them both.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,This is one of my favorite infant gifts! It plays wonderful classical pieces. The sides are easy for infants to activate. Each side flashes as that instrument plays to keep their attention. Good for infant to age 5 at least!,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"We bought this for our son when he was six months old.  He's now 18 months old, and he still enjoys playing with it, but it drives me crazy when he plays more than 2 of the instruments at one time.  There is an intonation problem among the instruments that is unbearable to anyone who has experience in music.  True, the baby loves the lights and he loves having control over the music and what's playing, but I almost have to leave the room when he gets too many ""musicians"" going at once.This is fun toy, but don't buy it if you can recognize bad pitch.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My son LOVES this toy.  He will be playing with other toys, walk over to the cube turn on some music and then go back to his toys. He will do this almost all day long.  He loves playing with it as well.  We bought it when he was 1 year old and he has been playing with it ever since (16 mos now).  And another good point is that the sound quality of the music is good enough for a parent's ears as well.  Buy this toy.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"After looking for a musical toy that was not annoying, off-key or obnoxious, we discovered this.  Plays several songs by Mozart; baby can play a song with all instruments at once by pressing ""orchestra"" or one at a time.  Baby can also turn off instruments one at a time. The instruments are clearly synthesized, but still, the quality is not bad and I could listen to it for long periods of time.  I have yet to be annoyed by this toy.  In fact, I may have to buy two - my twins fight over it constantly!  My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it's a little bit loud.  I wish there was a volume control.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,This is another favorite toy of my grandson's.  I hope that he picks up an appreciation for the wonderful music it provides.  It is a safe toy with no sharp edges and is easy for Brian to play with.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Munchkin Mozart Magic CubeThe older version of this toy had much better songs and in addition to that it's so hard to enjoy playing with this because it's painfully loud.  Ridiculously loud.,2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My son loves this thing.  He has sat and listened to songs repeatedly, turning various instruments on and off to hear the effect.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This cube is large and heavy so young babies cannot hold it, nor totally grasp the concept...which means that it will not be a toy they will be able to (or even want to) play with independently.  In addition,  the manufacturer's recommended age (6 mos -boy are they trying to pull one over on parents) is extremely too young.  I also think this toy is priced too high.  We've bought large activity tables for less than the cost of this cube that entertain my son longer. If given the choice,  I would not purchase it again unless I found it used and/or substantially cheaper.  Recommended age: 1 yr. and up. Recommended purchase price: $14.99 or less.",3
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I bought this but my little one is definitely not old enough yet to grasp the concept...but she is getting there and lives to play with it, and so do I! Not annoying but very good tones. Love it, bought one for my nephew and cousin too!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Great toy in theory, but way too loud!  I bought it and as soon as I realized that there's no way to control the sound I decided to return it.  Would be a great toy if added volume control to it!",1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Worked great for about a month, then it broke and no longer plays music. Not for toddlers who like to throw things.",2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,My 6 month old is captivated by this toy. He loves to hear the music and it's easy enough for him to press the various sides. The music and the lights hold his attention. This actually belonged to his now 5 year old sister and it's held up well in the five years we've owned. I highly recommend it.,4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"The musical sounds don't sound like the real instruments, they just sound like a cheap toy. Also, I thought each instrument would play its own melody, how it would in a real orchestra. For example, the horn would play the background, the flute a lighter melody, then all the instruments would combine to create the true melody when the orchestra button is pressed. But really, each button plays exactly the same notes except with a different instrument.  I was really disappointed, and my daughter prefers the music buttons from her Tiny Love Activity Center. The ones on that toy are really neat.",1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Bought this for a 6-month old pseudo-niece as a Christmas gift. In the two or so hours she had the gift she seemed completely engrossed in the toy and entertained. She had no issue comprehending what to do with it and was playing within a minute of first touching the toy.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I found this item to be very disappointing. For one thing it's much too large and heavy for a baby to pick up and handle, although it may just be that my baby is too young for this toy at 7 months. The real issue I have with this toy is that the sounds it makes are just horrible. Off key, electrical sounding ""music"" is layered together to create a loud, jumbled, unpleasant sound that makes me want tear my hair out. This is not the learning toy I expected, coming from a family of musicians I'm going to say that this toy offers absolutely nothing for a child's musical development. If you want your child to have a love and understanding of music, listen to classical, jazz or other complex music with them. If you want a toy that will benefit your child musically, give them a xylophone to play with. It's simple and fun, and will always produce a perfect tone.",1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This is a great toy, and the only toy my 8 month old son played with on Christmas morning (other than boxes and paper).  There is no volume, but I do not find it too loud.  It is very durable, and I find the quality to be very high.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Just enough stimulation -- lights, colors and music.  And the music is actually pleasant as opposed to so many of the baby toys we have!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This is a wonderful toy.  I bought it for my son when he was a young toddler (probably sometime in 2008).  He liked it, but wasn't in love with it.  My second child is now 13 months, and she LOVES this toy.  She always pushes the buttons and dances to the music.  I host a playgroup for children between 7 months and 3 years, and this is a wonderful toy to have out for all to enjoy.  The babies tend to play with it more, but the toddlers like to come over to see what they are doing.  I bought this in November as a baby shower present as well.  Both times, I purchased the product on sale (I think for around sixteen dollars).  For that price, it is definitely worth it.  I'd also like to note that I have only had to change the batteries once in the 2 years I have owned this.  It definitely sounds awful when the batteries are dying.  Overall, a wonderful toy for babies and young toddlers!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My son has played with this toy nonstop.  He is now 16 months old and it is one of the first things he reaches for when he wakes up.  When we travel I have make sure its packed.  Some kids have blankets, mine has the music cube.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Purchaed as a gift for family member.  They tell me the baby loves to play with it, and loves too lok at the flashing lights.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My daughter received this as a baby gift when she was a newborn.  It was her favorite toy all through infancy and toddlerhood.  We even took it on a 15-hr international flight to keep her happy!  Even though it's a baby toy, both my children still enjoy listening to the music at ages 3 and 5.  This toy is WELL worth it!  It's a little tricky changing batteries, but you'll probably only need to change them once every 6-12 months.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This music cube is the best baby toy I have ever seen.  And it was by far our baby's favorite toy.1.  Good Music and Educational.  What's more educational than good music for a baby?  The six sides include five instruments (flute, french horn, harp, piano, & violin) and the orchestra which plays all five together.  What I love is that the instruments can be played separately, or together depending on which ones you touch.  You can start one, and then when you press the second it joins the first.2.  Portable and Safe.  We loved the smallish size and took the cube with us on planes, car rides, and into restaurants.  No sharp edges, no metal.  Each corner is covered in a firm rubber (which is also good for chewing on...).  Not heavy so if it falls on your little one, no tears.  Although light weight, the cube is sturdy and firm enough for your little one to use as a base to lean on.  Our baby used the cube not only to lean on, but also to help her stand up.3.  Easy to Use, Good for parents.  The cube is one piece, no complicated set-up, and takes just two easy-to-find AA batteries.  There is also an on/off switch which is useful when traveling to prevent the music from playing continually in your luggage bag.  The music is NOT annoying, nor particually loud.  And if you want to stop or change the tune, just touch the side that is playing at that time and it will immediately stop.Fun for your baby, educational, good for parents-- I highly recommend this toy for any parent with a baby.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This is a totally cool product...for the parents.  By the time the small child this is designed for could possibly appreciate what the toy teaches, he/she would be at least 5-10 years old and by then, the toy still requires patience.  This is just a good idea that can't quite reach the audience it hopes too.  I still like the toy, but sadly, it's just not for babies. (And I'm a musician with a broad mind for what my little one can understand---this is just too advanced.)Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube",2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My son really enjoyed the Mozart cube,  but it didn't last very long. It stopped working after less than 2 weeks of use.  I changed the batteries, but it still didn't work. It is just too pricey for the amount of time that it lasted.",1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My twins loved this toy when they were infants,  they'd stare at the flashing lights and listen to the music.  Now they are 13 months old, and my son in particular loves to turn the various sides off and on listening to how the music changes.Often, if I need to distract him from something I can start the cube playing and he'll go right over to it and start to play with it.There's the added benefit that the music is pleasant for adults as well.  We don't get tired of hearing it play over and over again, and it has several different Mozart pieces that it plays.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,our son loves anything that plays music and when we heard about this toy we went out and bought it.  He was 15 months old then and didn't seem to like it.  He pushed the buttons afew times but mainly it just sat. I bring it out every couple of weeks to show him how neat it is and it still does nothing for him.  He is now 21 months old.  He loves the leap frog drum and the phonics radio.  ANd they were only 19.99 each not 34.99.I wouldn't spend your money on this.,1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,i work with multiple disabled children and they love this toy. I bought this one for my 6 month old niece and has the most fun trying to figure her colors.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"sound is good, the way the music evolves with diff instruments if you push them is nice, but is waaayy toooo heavy for baby to carry and to push!!",3
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Great idea, and fun for the baby, but so loud that I have actually wondered whether it is safe for my child's hearing. I can hear this toy all the way upstairs, in a totally different part of the house if it is playing in the living room. I have heard it TWO floors up at my parents' house. It is WAY too loud, and unfortunately there's no way to turn it down.",3
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This is the best purchase I have made thus far for my new grandchild.  She has loved it from the very beginning and her interaction with it as she grows is ever changing and stimulating. She has gone from just looking and listening to it, to pressing the buttons herself and chewing on the ends as a teether and has begun to select the music and instruments on her own. It is an incredibly well designed item and very sturdy as well.This is an excellent choice for a baby gift.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,We received this toy as a gift for our baby. Haven't used it yet but we had the same trouble with the packaging as everyone else! Pliers work.,4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This music cube is a great idea, but unfortunately the sound quality is terrible. The violin doesn't sound at all like a violin. Overall it's very tinny and hard to listen to.",2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I was a little skeptical at first.  But this cube is a lot of fun! There are instruments on each side that can be turned on and off while contributing to the main song.  You can have a piano solo, and then add other instruments on top.  Well built cube, should last a long time!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I knew this thing wouldnt sound very good, I can accept that. Most all of these kind of toys sound like crap. What gets me is the violin is badly out of tune with the other insturments. Many a sour note. My son holds his ears when it plays all the insturments together. Otherwise its another piece of plastic that makes noise and passes the time. What do you expect for 20 bucks? Want to get your child into music? Get them a harmonica. My son plays all the time and passes on the cube.",1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,my 1 year old son loves turning on and off this music on this toy! its a great product for babies who love music!,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My baby daughter got this as a gift. I thought it sounded terrible and it scared her. I might have hung onto it to see if she would grow into it, if it weren't so loud. It's so loud, I was worried it would damage her hearing while she was holding it close enough to play with it. I returned it, and bought her aLamaze Mortimer the Moose, which she loves. It makes nice jingling, crinkling, and squeaking sounds.",1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This is a baby present we have given to all members of our family when their first child was born. I learned about it when it was first given to one of our grandchildren by a family friend. Our grandson listened to it when he was an infant, turned on the musical components as he learned how to press the sides, and then stood up and conducted music when he grew to toddler age. The children to whom we have given this toy also love it and their parents have been delighted with it.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Bought for my niece.  I blew plenty of time playing with it when it came in even though it was in the box still.  Can't wait till she opens it so I can get back to playing with it.Will update after I see how she likes it.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,This toy is great! 1 year old Son got it as a gift and really enjoys it. He likes to throw things and has not done any damage to it yet. It has rubber corners so for now my floors are ok too. You can press a side of the cube and it will add a new instrament to the mix without restarting the music. I hate when toys start something new the second your child touches it. This one dosn't stop until the song is done unless you touch each instrament playing a 2nd time to turn it off. Love Love LoveOnly down side is the flute and violin sound a lot like eachother.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I purchased this for my special needs grandson who is 4. He loves toys that light up and make sound. It is difficult to find ones that he can easily operate and manipulate with his limited abilities. This fits his needs perfectly.The quality is very good, and I got a good price on it. Product is durable, so when he drops it from his wheelchair, it's not a big deal. I would highly recommend this toy for small children and older special needs children.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Yep, we're on our third grandchild, second Mozart cube.  This is the best toy in the world.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My daughter got this for Christmas when she was about 6 mos old.  She rarely ever plays with it.  She was slightly amused with this toy for a month or two.  She never plays with it now.  When she did show interest in it, it only lasted a few moments.  The music does get a little annoying because my daughter liked it when all instruments would play at the same time.  Nothing special about this toy and it's loud.  Would not recommend.",2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,got this for my granddaughter --enjoyed by the whole family !!! --the sound quality could be richer and fuller --great teaching toy none the less Griffiths,4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Our seven-month-old twins love this. They are still too young to understand the functionality of adding and subtracting instruments, but they are fascinated by the sounds and babble happily along with them. Plus, the tunes are actual Mozart melodies and considerably less annoying for adults than the bleeps of many other ""musical"" toys. If anyone at Munchkin is reading this review, we would love a Bach Cube for variety!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My niece is musically gifted at the age of 1, and I think she will love this toy.  It is bright, colorful, and the instrument sounds are similar to the actual instrument the block depicts.  It will be fun for a one year old to press the colorful block buttons to hear the sounds they make.  If you are looking for a true-tone musical toy, keep looking.  It is exactly what I expected from reading other reviews about theMunchkin Mozart Magic Cube",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Our grand child loves playing with this musical cube. It is very relaxing. All Music is food for the soul...,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My wife and I have been living with these 8 tunes for the last 4 months with our 7 mos. old.  He was attracted to the noise and lights from the outset, and it remains his favorite light and noise toy to this day.  He can manipulate it easily, and is fascinated by his control over the sound.The toy itself is very well designed.  The panels take just the right pressure to activate, the chip does an excellent job of determining whether a press is designed to turn a panel on, off, or was just an errant double-tap from a youngster with less than 100% control over his appendages.  The rounded rubber corners are safe, flash enticingly, and apparently taste delightful.There are only 2 reasons I give this 4 stars rather than 5.  The first is that moisture can seep around the panels and destroy the contacts inside, keeping the panel from operating.  We've lost one panel so far to well-aimed spit-up.  Babies and wetness go hand-in-hand, after all.  The second is that while the eight songs are well-chosen, it would be nice if manufacturers started designing these toys with the ability to either purchase or download additional tunes to update the cube.  For nearly 50 dollars, either a tune-stick slot or a flash USB port would be a very welcome relief to parents who have heard the french horn solo to twinkle, twinkle little star for an hour straight.**Six month update***The cube is still going strong, except for the one panel I mentioned as having failed earlier.  Although we use rechargeable batteries it is still nice that it really sips battery power.  The set of included alkalines went nearly 6 months before needing to be replaced.The cube is still a favorite toy, and has grown with our son.  Now it is baby's first boom-box -- he drags it with him to other toys, gives it a casual slap to get it started, and enjoys the music while he plays with his blocks or toy cars.  When he really focuses on it, he enjoys making it change sounds by activating or deactivating the various panels.  He has the sing-along version as well, and he will fire them both up and frown at the cacophony; much like a 3-foot orchestra conductor.The bottom line is that this toy has been a winner from day one, and continues to be a winner.  For its price, it is a fantastic value, and for the fun it brings our baby, it is priceless.  If I could, I would update our star rating to 5.  My earlier comments are still valid, but it's really the maestro's toy, and it's pretty clear how he feels about it: 5 stars all the way.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"We absolutely LOVE this cube! I bought it for my 5m nephew...and although he can't quite sit up on his own yet, it is still an entertainer for him. Anytime we want to distract him, we start up the magic cube! The sounds are good (not annoying) and becos you can add and subtract any ""instrument"", it is not boring. I do wish the lights were brighter and more visual, but this is becod the cube itself is so colorful. Great product!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I thought this toy was really cute and it was definitely a hit with the child that I gave it too. However I bought two of the products and was extremely disappointed that only one actually worked properly.  Before you send something the people should make sure the product is actually working properly.,3
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Our first son received this toy for his first B-Day from his Great-Grand Parents.  He played with it almost daily, and now three years later his younger brother plays with it.  It's not annoying like many toys can be as the music is soft and relaxing. LOVE IT! Would for sure buy again if needed.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This seems like a great toy for the musically inclined baby, my 5 month old likes looking at the flashing lights and trying to eat it the music doesn't seem too loud to me or out of tune,  perhaps that is a defect for the previous reviewer?  My son seems to love looking at it and pushing the buttons, I think once he is a bit older he might appreciate it more.  However I do agree it is a great book shelf toy too.  IT looks fantastic!",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,This toy was given to my son last christmas by my aunt. He loves this toy for all the different music it plays.  This is his favorite toy with the different sounds and lights...,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Our babies enjoy this music cube. They didn't take long to start pounding on it.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,He loved it.  Hopefully when he is a little older he'll listen to each part completely instead of going to the next button!!!,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My kids (5 and 16 months) both adore this toy and it keeps their attention for a long time. It's also extremely durable, much to my chagrin. Unfortunately it has no volume control and it's so obnoxiously loud that I have to leave the room when they play with it. I also wish it had better sound quality - I'd prefer them to hear real music with real instruments. I plan on smuggling it out of the house when they're not looking.",2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"great idea for a musical toy. i just wish the individual instrument sounds were a little more realistic. i might be a bit of a snob because i am a music teacher--but it seems like they could have done a better job with the sounds. still, the idea for the toy is great and i believe my son will really enjoy it as he gets a little bit older.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This is my &#34;go to&#34; baby gift.  Of all the musical toys, this one sounds best! I love the chance to listen to individual instruments and then to hear them all play together.  Our Grands all love this toy!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This is a great toy in concept, especially for classical music lovers. My infant received it for his first birthday and his older brother, now 7 y.o, enjoys it as well. Pressing the buttons on the side of the cube allows them to assemble (instrument) parts of the song and even create their own little orchestra. The cube plays a number of recognizable tunes and the sound quality is good.However, the toys that arrived in our house were all damaged before they arrived. The outer layer is a very fine strip of plastic and the first two or three (I don't remember how many) that arrived were cracked and ready to splinter.Thin, sharp pieces of plastic or plastic splinters not good for babies, right?Amazon was quick to ship replacements, even without getting the original back, but I ended up returned at least two, maybe three. Think it was three. Sent two in one box together. Shipping paid by Amazon of course, but this was intended as my child's birthday present. It was ordered about two or three wks before his first birthday and he got the final undamaged toy about a month AFTER his birthday. Big points Amazon.The packing on this particular item was HORRIBLE! One air bag in an oversized box so this thing got banged all over tarnation. Big points again Amazon.",2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My little one year old son loves to pick his own instruments/music. A music lover myself, I feel this toy was an introduction to my toddler's love for music. He now knows different keys, strings etc. cause different sounds. Great for 'cause and effect' learning as well!!",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Our baby loves music so we knew this would be a great choice.  We were right!  She dances and sings to the rhythms.,4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My daughter had this toy for 6 years before it finally stopped working.  She loved it when she was a baby/toddler and would still play with it as she got older.  It took a lot of abuse and still worked great!  I babysit in my home, so it went through dozens of children rolling it around and pounding on the buttons and throwing it across the room.  I enjoyed the music and it was a great way to show kids how each instrument sounds by itself and then all together.  The kids loved starting with the flute and adding each instrument until they were all playing and then pushing the buttons until it was back to one.  Overall a great toy that will last for years!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I have a disabled daughter that is 27. Even though this item is geared for babies. My daughter is able to benefit from the cause and effect of the age appropriate music.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My 15-month-old loves this music box.  It's durable, too, which means Mom loves it too.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,This is an entertaining toy. The sound is of good quality and not too loud. Although it is not a music studio sound quality - it is far better than the usual kind of sound found in most toys. It is not annoying too for adults. It is also of good size- not too small. The edges are made of some kind of rubber material that does not easily slip or protects the toy when falling.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I love this Magic Cube.  It was a gift from a friend, and is a fantastic toy.  The musical selection is good, the quality of the tones is also quite good.  It is the first interactive toy my four month old baby figured out how to use, though he tends to hit the sides with his feet rather than his hands.  You won't regret this one!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"When I received Munchikin Mozart Magic Cube, I was very disappointed because it looked so cheap and its tone was not beautiful at all. But my 23-month old baby son immediately fell in love with this toy.  I'm happy to see him playing with this many hours a day  giggling and chuckling.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I bought this when my baby was less than a year old. He loved it. While it is not the highest quality music, this is a toy that was meant for children and they seem to really enjoy using it. It is easy for their uncoordinated hands to use and interesting enough that they continue to explore it. It has bright lights and different musical instruments to select from or to blend together.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"This was a good gift for my nephew's birthday.  He played with it for a while despite all the distractions of a birthday party!  I cannot comment on durability.  Battery installation requires a screwdriver, the cover is good for keeping those tiny fingers out.The sound from the unit was fine and it functioned as described.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,No kidding. My 18 month old baby loves this music cube !!! It is one of the few toys that my kid has payed attention to. I like it a lot myself. I strongly recommend this toy,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My daughter has been playing with this toy for a year and a half, and loves it still.  It is the least annoying musical toy we own.  The music is pretty, the quality of the sound is quite good, and you can listen to it for 2 years without wanting to pull your hair out.  She has long since understood the difference in musical instruments and can recognize the individual sounds of instruments in the music we hear throughout the day.  ""Listen Mommy, a french horn!""",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,The coolest thing about this cube is that you can push the different sides to have that specific instrument play in the song. It's great for your kids learning to hear different songs. It also lights up and plays very nice classic type melodies vs the standard children's songs.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I purchased this for my one year old niece. It was great while it lasted -- for one day. The music was loud, clear. The toy is easy to use and fun to play with. The colors are great and quite attractive to toddlers.However! it broke after ONE day of playing. My niece simply dropped it from her height, which is at most one feet! After she dropped it, a strong plastic burning smell started to come from the cube. I immediately unscrewed the panel that covers the batteries, and removed the batteries.Now whenever I move the cube, I can hear something loose inside. This toy should not be of such poor quality if made for kids of ""all ages"" who could do all sorts of unimaginable things to it!Great toy, but TERRIBLE quality. I recommend spending your money on alternatives if you can find one.UPDATE: After opening up the cube, it is obvious that the speaker module was never securely placed into its socket, and because of this it has severed a ribbon cable. Because of this manufacturing problem, when the cube is moved or rolled around, the speaker module pulls on the surrounding ribbon cables repeatedly which eventually breaks the solder joint that connects the wire to the circuit boards. The short circuit, which causes the melting plastic (and the fire hazard) is a result of the exposed power and ground connections making contact with the severed ribbon cable. The cube now functions correctly. However I will be keeping a close eye on it.",1
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,My one year old son loves it. It is well constructed. No sharp edges. Safe for babies. Very easy to clean. Battery is still going strong after 6 months.,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I bought this magic cube about 2-3 months ago and at that time my baby wasn't really able to play with it. But now he's 6 months and he plays with the cube longer and longer. This is one of my baby's favorite toys now!,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"We love this toy. I bought it for my 5th month old for christmas, and now he's 9 months and he still loves it. The best part is... it's not annoying at all! Score for mom :-). It lights up and has a rubbery grip to it so i don't haver to worry about him bitting the sides of it when his teeth are bothering him. Very happy we bought this item.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Shows different musical instruments so baby can experience either each instrument on its own or combined with others. However munchkin did a bad job with packaging using wires to secure box to package. Wires are attached to internal part of cube and not possible to remove. Had to cut, could not pull out so had to push remnant wire into cube. One wire got stuck and may poke my child. Think will throw the cube away as it is a safety hazard.",2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My 22-month-old twins luuuuuuuuuvvv this little Mozart cube (one of them in particular -- he tries to take it everywhere he goes!). Unfortunately there is no button to lower the sound, as there is on many musical toys, but it is Mozart, so it isn't grating to adult ears. This is a terrific toy and I'm sure it's good for my little guys to be listening to world-class music. However, the toy itself is not very durable, in my opinion. We've only had it three weeks, and already the sound has stopped playing (though the lights still light up). My little nephew has one of these cubes as well, and his mom pointed out that although his still works, the plastic cover has cracked, causing them to wrap it in plastic tape so that it would not fall apart. I am buying a second one for my boys because they adore it -- but if this one dies too, that's it. No more cubes at twenty bucks a pop.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,i gave this to my ten month old daughter as a gift and she loves it! i think she enjoys the different musical responses she get as she touches a different side of the cube. this is very colorful and seems durable as well...wonderful...very pleased,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Our toddler has what we call a &#34;jukebox&#34; tendency- he sort of uses any musical toys as background music while doing other activities. Most musical toys became quickly grating to our ears so we invested in this highly rated toy. Well, he LOVES it and the sound quality of this toy is good enough where you as an adult can appreciate the Mozart melodies. He plays with this several times a day, every day so as far as we're concerned it was a great investment.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"my 8 month old love this toy! ..... the music is wonderful .... and sounds great! best to put the cube on the floor for your baby to sit up and play. this is great gift for any reason..... the only thing i would want to see improvement in. is to make the volume adjustable, which it's only on one level loud ..... i don't mind it...... my husband tends to yell back at it .... and i sit and laugh !!!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"Batteries ran out of power right away. When it was opened for Christmas the Harp light didn't work.Compared to the older version, I didn't think the songs were as good. Have been about ready to send it back.",2
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"We bought this for our granddaughter before she was a year old.  She just batted at the cube to make music.  She is now two and a half; she has progressed from random punching of the different sides (""directing"" the orchestra as she went), to adding and subtracting instruments and changing the song. She's danced to it, sung with it, and dropped it several times.  We have never had to change the battery, not has it ever slipped up in its performance.  This is the greatest toy she owns; learning to love Mozart is a wonderful bonus for this piano-teacher grandma.  Now I'm buying one for my newest nephew.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I realized that my son was stimulated visually so I decided to buy this toy for him. I was so amazed how quickly he responded to it especially when I turned off the lights. If your child is very observant, this is definitely the toy to get.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I bought this for my 8 month old son. From 8 months to 18 months, this was by far his favorite toy. He would spend hours playing with it and was one of the few toys he didn't get bored of. He would press the buttons, hug the cube and yes, occaisonally he would throw it down the steps, because it makes noise when bouncing from step to step. When he finally managed to destroy the first one I quickly purchased a second to replace it.One of the best toy purchase I have made for him. The music is not the greatest and does have a tinny ring to it. This is not something that I would listen to or enjoy, but then again the toy is for my son and not for me. If you need concert quality sound then an iPod stuck to 4 Bose speakers may be the way to go for you. If you want a toy which keeps your kid happy, this toy will be hard to beat.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,We love this toy!  We bought this for our daughter when she was 15 months old.  She is now 19 months old and we still play with it every day.  The music is not too loud or annoying like most children's musical toys.  Adults love to play with it too!,5

"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","I am so disappointed.  I have a standard toilet seat and this potty seat does not sit snuggly on it, and does not even come close to fitting my elongated one upstairs.  Plus it has no rubber grip material as many do on the bottom to keep it in place once my little one sits down.  As a result he slips every time.  I suggest bypassing this one and making sure you find one that is either adjustable or comes with some secure grips underneath.  Many potty seats are non returnable -- unless you can test it on your toilet first, don't risk this one!",2
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",It is cute and my kids love it. I don't love it as much because it does not have the pee guard. That is part of why I bought it. My kids have a problem with peeing on the floor and this does nothing to stop that. If you don't need a pee stopper this will be a fine toilet seat.,3
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","it is not safe.  i would give it NO stars if i could.  this seat will not stay put on any toilet seat, there is nothing to wedge it into place.  as soon as your child tries to sit back on it, the potty seat pushes back out from under their bottom leaving the child unsupported.  the point is supposed to be to give your child independence, not make them dependent on you holding their seat in place. and i never imagined the ease in which the urine would get between the padded seat and the hard plastic bottom...it happened the first time.  poor kid, this was his reward for going potty so well.  we are going back to the FISHER PRICE TURTLE SEAT.  it adjusts to clamp into the seat so it won't budge and it is all one piece so there is no place for urine to get trapped..",1
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","bought this as a replacement for my son's first potty seat, this one is much better. not as padded, which means it won't rip open and harbor a bunch of bacteria. my son's old one used to collect urine underneat of it in the plastic part, this one doesn't at all, it's perfect",5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",I bought this seat for my 3 year old son because he loves Spiderman. This seat is awful for boys because the area of plastic prevents the pee from going into the potty. Instead it splashes every where else. I would not recommend this seat at all for a boy.,1
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","We have an elongated toilet and I don't know of anyway to hold this seat in place. My daughter has trouble sitting back far enough because when she tries to scoot back, the whole seat goes with her. So when she pees, it gets in between the potty ring and the toilet seat and makes a big mess.",1

"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","My son wanted a Thomas potty and this was a good choice for him. He loves the trains on the seat. However, the hole is not big enough. We have a difficult time getting my son positioned on the potty so that he can go without getting urine on the seat. And the cusion is not easy to keep clean because urine gets trapped underneath it and in the sides.",3
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",My son loves spongebob so naturally I had to get this for his potty seat. The pee shield isn't attached. Doesn't come with handles attached (which I noticed it said that later) and it wobbles on the toilet. Needless to say I went out and bought another seat and this one is in the closet,2
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","We have 3 of these (1st was a gift; subsequent others purchased from Amazon after successful use). It is comfy padding (I presume comfy - the padding is quite thick and has some squish to it). The handles are great for keeping my daughter's hands busy instead of touching other things. While it does slide around on some larger toilets, I'd say it fits well to about 75% of toilets we've used it on.",5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",I bought this from the wish list of a homeless shelter where I live. They have a number of children living there and I imagine many of them potty train while they are staying there. I know how much my nieces and nephews love Dora so I thought this would get used more than a plain potty seat.,4
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","I uploaded some pics of the size of toilet it fits, this potty seat is so good ,my daughter loves Dora so I got this for her.Take a look at the pictures I uploaded ,thanks for reading ,I hope I helped someone with the pics.",5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",Affordable. However the soft patted Dora seat falls off.  It does not click in to were you can carry without the patted coming off.,4
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","My daughter never wanted to go potty, was scared of the big toilet, but as soon as she saw her Spongebob seat she hopped right on and loved using it. Made potty training her a BREEZE. She switched straight over to the big potty and never looked back.",5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","My three year old son started training a year ago, on a stand alone potty.The thing was good for when he was little, and a potty novice, but now its more trouble than its worth. We purchased this seat when he was 2 1/2 (SpongeBob, he LOVES Spongebob!)PROS- Its not overly expensive- Comfortable to sit on for any ellapsed amount of time- Has SpongeBob on it, this could be a disstraction, but it makes my son want to go more!- Easy for a toddler to remove his/herself, and trust me this is a BIG deal to them! (with a stand alone they want to dump the contents, which never fails to leave a mess!)- The splash gaurd is rather flimsy, so I attached a piece of velcro to the side that would touch the potty, and another to the part of the potty where the guard attaches. It is still removable, but not flimsy. Its also high enough to catch everything- Its lightweight, easy for me or my son to carry.- Easy to store, right on the side of the potty, and also easy for him to put on himself!- Fits my oddly shaped toilet seats well.CONS- The seat is cushy and comfortable, but ours recently tore, and the rips hurt and annoy him, so I am now purchasing another from Amazon as I cannot find the SpongeBob one in stores.- Its hard to find, I could only find Elmo (he LOVES elmo, but he thinks SpongeBob is a big boy show, and Elmos a baby show, he wants to be a big boy on the potty)- The vinyl sticks to his bottom, and sometimes he wont get off because hes afraid of the sting when he gets up.All in all I wish we would have used the SpongeBob seat from the start! Its so easy to use, and simple (eww, stand alones are kinda gross) and I defiantly plan to keep this seat around for my 5 month old son, but purchasing another one, with another charecter will be possible. I reccomend everyone to use this potty, kids love em', and you wont miss the mess!",5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","I won't recommend this seat because it moves around too much no matter what kind of toilet seat you it put on.  Other seat that I purchased comes with non-skid/slide things that come with the seat that keeps the seat in place when your child sits on it, but this one has nothing to hold the seat in place and moves around way too much.",2
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",this potty seat was just as described. nice colors. seems to be well made. any backyardigans fanatic will love this. a great potty training tool. very pleased.  J. Early,5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",my son loves it! it is very easy to use. my son loves spongebob so it makes him want to go potty.  :),5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","We bought this because my son loves Elmo.  Unfortunately, he now refuses to sit on it because it slips around on our elongated toilet seat. It is completely unstable.  He won't admit it, but he's afraid of it.  So, now he won't go on the big potty and is back to his Baby Bjorn potty chair.  I'm going to buy something else.",2
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",My daughter is almost 2 and didn't really take to a traditional potty chair. She loves Dora so this seat seems to be working like a charm!,5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","My son is almost 2.5 years old, and has been potty training for about a month.  We have two potty seats---one for upstairs, one for downstairs.  This one is decent--we have no problems with it fitting on our elongated toilet.However, be prepared to clean up pee if you use this with a boy!  He has to sit just right in order to aim down and not get pee on the seat--I don't think the pee guard is high enough for use with boys.  Also--if he 'aims' just right, pee gets under the seat, causing a mess on the regular toilet seat.  I have to clean both seats every time I take this one off for adult use.  It's easier for him to use it when he isn't wearing anything below the waist--he's better able to get his legs spread further apart for better support and aim.I think this would be better for girls--but someone has to get it right for boys!",3
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","The seat was very visually appealing and motivated him to potty, until he discovered that the vinyl seat stuck to his thighs and ripped skin off when he got up.  The result was red sore thighs for a good 12 hours and his complete fear of pottys.  If the big potty topic comes up, he wimpers and complains the big potty hurts and bit him. Back to the bjorn I guess.",2
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","It arrived today. On the package, there was a sticker saying ""This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, or birth defects or other reproductive harm."". I am returning it today without even opening the product.",1
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","Really, how hard can it be to design one of these things? This fails for two basic reasons:1) It slides backwards on the toilet seat making it unstable and hard for my daughters to sit down. This is an enormous design flaw.2) The pee guard is basically flush with the seat, so what is its purpose other than to decrease the actual potty-business real estate? It takes away room for daughters' pee to go down. And it's not high enough to save my baby boy from getting soaked when my daughter didn't clamp her knees shut tightly enough to prevent her pee from shooting cleanly over the guard and onto baby's head. He was not pleased. Neither was I.I also have a two mini-potties, the Fisher Price froggy and singing ducky. The pee guard on the froggy potty is great. I love this low-tech seat as it's easy to clean and hands down my twin daughters' favorite. The singing duck potty was more expensive, is much harder to clean, is annoyingly loud and wakes up the baby, and there are a lot more spills due to the lack of pee guard. Highly recommend the froggy potty if you are in the market.",1
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",The Dora potty seat goes with us everywhere when we go out. My daughter has recently potty trained but isn't ready to use the toilet yet so this seat is perfect. She also loves the pretty design :),5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",Another child to potty train and anything they are into to get them to go is where I head and this seems to do the trick. It holds up well and she seems to enjoy seeing Dora.,5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","Really colorful and does its purpose but it does slide a bit in the toilet bowl. No biggie, since it gets the job done.",4
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","My daughter who is 20 months old LOVES this seat...I bought the royal toddler potty but decided to buy this one as well b/c its good to travel with...she refuses to sit on the royal potty..she rather use this one on the toilet seat.  The only problem is we have an oversized toilet so its not a snug fit, but it does the job.",4
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",Don't get this kind. They have fun designs but they are hard to clean. There are crevices were poo and pee can get stuck. Another main problem is the plastic molding that holds the cushion. It's sticking up a little bit in the inside circle and when the cushion gets pressed the buttocks get dented. Whenever my 2 yr old sits on this potty seat her buttocks would get red and the plastic molding would leave a mark. She would complain that it hurts to sit there for a long time. :(  I just bought ""Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Tushie Potty Seat"" It's amazing. No boo boos. And easy to clean. :),1
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","I had bought this cause I thought its cute. well its cute but it doesn't function well. My 2 1/2 year old son slides all over the place, its not secure at all. When he pees he pees over and the pee goes even in between the seat so i have to flush everything and clean the toilet. the cup holder is a joke.. it really holds nothing, so i cannot recommend this for boys at all. I am about to get another potty seat, something that will hold his pee and will fit safely in my toilet.",1
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","We have a daughter who is 3 1/2 and a son who is 21 months. We bought this seat for our son because the one we already had didn't have a splash guard and we thought our son would need one as he first started using the potty. I miss the handles we had on the other potty ring. When you need to take this ring off (for big people to use the potty), you have to grab the ring instead of just grabbing the handles. It seems dirty. Also, so far, my son is having no parts of this splash guard. He never saw his sister use one and he doesn't want to use the splash guard either. I don't blame him. There doesn't seem to be enough room to sit behind the guard without bumping into it. He loves the Diego pictures and our other potty ring for upstairs is the Backyardigans, which he also loves. He just doesn't want to use the guards, and I'd prefer handles.",3
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","My two year old had regressed to not wanting to use the potty. So I got this because she LOVES spongebob. Worked like a charm, now I hear all day I poop on Bob lol. If your kid likes Spongebob and you have having potty training issues, I can't promise anything but it cleared it right up for me :)",4
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","very hard seat, doesn't stay put inside toilet seat and isn't comfortable for the little ones.  My child refuses to use it and reminds me often that she doesn't like it.",1
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",Wonderful lightweight potty chair.  It even fits my oblong toilet seat.  Very encouraging for my son who is obsessed with ""Bob-bob"".,5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","This fits perfectly in the toilet. It's also cute, considering what it's used for. My son is a little too young for potty training still, but he likes to sit on it and look at spongebob.",5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",Purchased this for my Grandson to use at my house. Works very well and he really liked the Spiderman all over the potty. He used it and all is working well - I also bought the step stool (Thomas the Train logo on step stool).,5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",love ti - has a front little cover so he doesnt pee anywhere but in the toilet - love the handles - perfect,5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","Bought this for my 2 year old daughter when she started showing interest in using the potty. I echo other's complaints that it is not good for elongated toilet seats & slides back when my daughter tries to sit down. However, my daughter's biggest complaint is that it is uncomfortable and cuts into the backs of her legs. The pee guard is not removable so if she sits on the potty with her pants around her ankles the pee guard cuts into her legs. If she sits on the potty seat without pants on (and thus can spread her legs wider) the padding compresses and the plastic ring of the potty cuts into her legs.The Elmo print is cute and my daughter loves Elmo but the design flaws have left me in search of a new seat that she likes more.",2
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",Although my son was excited about this seat it does not function well.  My son is 2.5 and it's too small.  When he pees it ends up shooting over the seat rather than into the toilet.  If it were larger it would be much better.,2
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",My grandson love the Ginsey Diego Soft Potty Seat.It`s wondeful for him.It`s very practical and soft for kids.,5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo","this product is wonderful, especially for little boys. My son went through 3 potty seats/toliets before we got this one. the lip on the front is great for little boys. we found a lot of potty seats/toliets are not ment for little boys. but this one is perfect.",5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",I have the Diego and the Disney cars seat for my twin boys and would not recommend the diego toilet seat for boys as the cover that makes sure the penis goes into the toilet is not big enough cover. I like the cushion and handles though. I would rather recommend the Disney car toilet seat with a larger potty cover for peepee.,2
"Color your tub Fizzy Tints, Ages 3 and Up","We have a hard time getting my son to take a bath, due to the fact that he realizes that bath=bedtime.  But these tablets make bathtime fun, and when we ask him what color he wants his bath to be, he runs into the bathroom and is all ready to jump in!  These tablets dissolve in the water (even watching the dissolving is mesmerizing to him!) and change the color of the bath water.  I think they even make a submarine and other toys that you can put the tablets in and watch the colors move around the bath.  You should not use these with younger children because they take a while to dissolve, and a younger child might pick them up and put it in their mouth because they look a little like candy.  My son is 2, and completely gets what it's for, and hasn't tried to eat it.  I highly recommend these for stubborn bathers!",5
Sassy 602 - Teething Wing Butterfly,My son started teething early (3 months) and he was not yet able to control his movements enough to chew on teething objects.  He was however able to grab things and this butterfly was so easy for him to pick up. The one wing is like a handle and it easy for him to move and light enough for him to get to his mouth.  As the days go by he is finally able to chew on it for a few seconds before he loses the control.  He is still unable or uninterested in doing this with any other teething toy.  Plus he somehow finds the butterfly entertaining.  A+ for a young teether.,5
Sassy 602 - Teething Wing Butterfly,This product is well thought out.  I can see where my grandson will be able to hold this without any problems.  The colors are vibrant also.,5
Gund Baby Tinkle Crinkle Rattle Toy,My daughter's nickname is 'Worm' so this toy was just a natural purchase.  Little did I know that it was going to be one of her 'go to' toys that she wants to take with her everywhere.  There is a mini one available on Amazon as well and it's just as cute.  I'm not so sure what the Tinkle part stands for but the rest of the words in it's title name is accurate.,5
Gund Baby Tinkle Crinkle Rattle Toy,"I know the dimensions are listed, but for some reason I was surprised at how big/long the caterpillar is.  Because it is not like a big stuffed animal (long and thin) it was very easy for my 4 month old to hug and hold.  He can easily pull it to his mouth to bite on it.  He's almost 6 months now and can focus on one area or another...it is still big for him.  So I can see how for the next few months, he'll still be interested because it is big and he can do more and more with it.  my 2 year old niece visited and latched onto it and began imagination play.",5
Gund Baby Tinkle Crinkle Rattle Toy,"We initially got this toy for our daughter based on the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio rating.  I think it was too big for her at first, but now (she's eight months old) she loves it.  She rediscovered it a month or so ago and loves picking at the antennae as well as squeezing and shaking it to get the various sounds.  It's also nice because the sounds aren't obnoxious....",5
Gund Baby Tinkle Crinkle Rattle Toy,Got this for my nephew for Xmas and he's at the point where he's starting to grab and inspect things. Not to mention it's great for him to chew on while he's teething. I wish it lit up or did a little more but no real complaints. Great for infants!,4
Gund Baby Tinkle Crinkle Rattle Toy,My toddler certainly enjoys playing with  it.  Brightly colored and easy to clean. Great gift idea for toddlers. Recommend the smaller one as well.,4
Gund Baby Tinkle Crinkle Rattle Toy,We received this product and our little one really likes all the colors and the squeaking noise but I'm not sure where the &#34;crinkle&#34; part comes from because our product must be defective.  There isn't any crinkle but we can live without.,4
Baby Drum Musical Toy,I ordered this for a gift.  My little nephew loves it!  His big brother also frequently wants a turn. It pretty good quality also.,4
Baby Drum Musical Toy,Got this about a month ago for my 7 month old son.  He takes his sticks and beats on this thing forever.  We LOVE it!,5
Baby Drum Musical Toy,"For my 8 month old grandson who likes to bang on thngs. Put the sticks away till hes older, they went right in the mouth.",5
Baby Drum Musical Toy,"It's basic, it's simple, it's a drum.  Well constructed and can handle being tossed across the room by it's rambunctious 1 yr old owner.  If your child likes to make noise and bang on things like glass doors, give him this drum.  We also had to teach our son not to walk and run while chewing on the end of the drumstick.  It almost became a favorite teething toy.",5
Baby Drum Musical Toy,My son is 8 months and we've had this since he was Z months. My son loves this drum! He sits on the floor right beside it and wildly bangs either one or both drumsticks (included with drum) on its surface. Both sides of the drum are able to be used. The surface does get scratched pretty easily but it still sounds the same.,4
Baby Drum Musical Toy,"My 11 month old great-grandson loves this drum!  It took him awhile to learn to use the sticks instead of his hand, but now he bangs like a champ!  It is very well made and lightweight so he can lift it and move it around easily.  The colors are bright and attractive.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"This gate was a replacement for the crappy Swing 'N Lock.  This gate is so easy to install.  The only problem was we have baseboards and couldn't use the template.  SO I simply measure 3 inches off the floor and then marked the holes to drill and folded the template to get the upper holes marked.  We did however have a lot of wall damage due to the fact that this was installed on the metal corner protectors under the drywall and a lot of the joint compound fell off due to disturbing it.  I will not fix it now since I'm sure I'll have more to fix later.  I like this gate because it has two point of contact in the locked and closed position.  Both rails the upper and lower fit about 1 1/2 inch into a metal seat.  This makes it so secure.  I don't agree w/ the other reviewers that said the lower rail pops out, I'm sure if it was installed WRONG.  Just make sure to measure properly and make sure things are even, level and line up and there is NO way the rail is going to pop out!  I did pinch myself a few times opening this the first few times.  You have to slide the rail in a bit to swing it and there's a metal piece on the top rail that supports the two gates, ouch.  Will remember not to do that!",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"I just got 2 of these (top and bottom of the stairs) and think they are great. The most common complaint other reviewers have is that the bottom pops out. I think I know why:There are rectangular steel boxes for the top and the bottom latch ends of the gate. The box for the bottom is deeper than the one for the top. If you install the shallow box on the bottom and the deep box on the top, then the bottom of the gate will pop out easily. When the boxes are correct, the bottom is held securely.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,The gates(I bought three) are pretty and relatively easy to install.  My 20 month old is a climber and has scaled many gates; this one he can not because of the horizontal slats.  But it is easy for me to open with one hand and my older children to open with two hands.  I highly recommend this product.,5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"This is the only gate I've seen that is approved for stairs. It is really good for this purpose. It is sometimes awkward to install to a railing. Make sure not to install it too low, it'll catch the floor and is difficult to open. If you install it too high, the little ones can squeeze under.",4
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,Works well with banisters. The great thing about it is that you can remove it when you have guest over at night when the babies asleep.,4
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"This gate is great. We love the natural wood finish. I have had this gate for 6 years and it still looks like new! We used it to keep our Cocker Spaniel in the tiled part of the house while we were at work. Every time I use it, I think to myself how much I like it. It is very easy to open and shut. I like how it is securely bolted to the wall. However, if you don't want to put screws in your wall, this may not be the right one for you.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"We've had our gate for almost 5 years on the top of our stairs and it works beautifully. After installation my husband noticed that if pushed it would pop out on the bottom as our house is older and the walls are uneven.  He solved the problem easily by installing a small door stop on the other side of the gate bottom so the bottom of the gate slides between the metal bracket and the door stop.As others mentioned it is easy to remove (sans hardware) and reinstall.  My kids are 3 and 4 so we only need the gate at night.  Each morning I pop it off and store it away.  Even when it's on it doesn't look that bad, in fact I think it's one of the nicer gates I've seen.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,We cannot say enough good things about this gate.  We bought this gate almost four years ago for the top of our stairs (we have an open stairway in our living room to the lower level.  It is a very strong gate and has held up very well to child torture!  We really like that the gate can go both directions.  I would highly recommend this gate.,5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"This gate is awesome!  We have three of them and I (female) have installed them all myself with ease!  It probably took me 15 minutes the first time and 10 minutes with the additional two we bought.  And, the hardware is metal which is a huge plus!  We had purchased a very pricey gate that had plastic hardware, and after replacing it three times I gave up and purchased this one.  It comes with a template and it's simple to install - step by step instructions.  As long as you line the gate up correctly (which is explained in the instructions) it opens and closes quickly and easily for adults, however my three children, the oldest of which is almost six, can't figure it out!  And that's saying something because my three year old boy has figured out every contraption out there!  We love it and I recommend it to everyone!  Even when I'm in the store shopping and see people looking at gates I recommend it to them.  Buy it!  You'll LOVE it!!",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"If you buy this gate, do not buy it online unless you can return it to a store (which you can do with Babies r Us). I have three of these gates, and the first one I tried to install was terrible. The gate has two slatted panels and in order to close the gate, you have to slide one panel and latch it. But the panels would not slide - they were so stiff I would have had to use my foot as well as my hand to close the gate! Obviously unacceptable. But I checked another of the gates and it was fine, and worked like a charm. I don't know if it's relevant or not, but the first gate was made in Mexico, and the second in China. Maybe there's a bad batch of Mexican-made gates out there, or maybe it was just a one-off. I don't know, but it may be something for you to be aware of if you purchase this gate.Also, I attached the gate to a relatively narrow doorway, so the two panels were mostly overlapping. So the gate is nice and sturdy, and I think it would be good even at the top of stairs, if the stairway is narrow. However, I DO NOT recommend this gate for use anywhere - especially the top of stairs - if you need to use it towards its widest range. The two panels are then stretched out and the gate becomes flimsy. It's my suspicion that those who have complained about the gate being flimsy and the bottom rail popping out have used the gate in a wider opening than those who think its a sturdy gate. So don't buy this gate if you need it for a wide opening.Finally, the third gate also slides well (made in China) but it will not fit where I wanted to put it. I suspect it is common to many gates that they work only in quite specific situations, and you can't really tell if it's going to work in your situation until you get it home and really take a good look at it. So, once again, do be sure you can return this (and probably any other) gate before buying.All in all, I recommend this gate - but ONLY IF you will be using it in a narrow opening. It is sturdy and not too difficult to install. It also looks reasonably nice if that matters to you.",3
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"We bought ours at Lowes. We were so happy because it looks good, it's lightweight, and easy to open. However, after installing it on top of our stairs, I question my husband on how it swings... then all of sudden the spindle came off! The spindle was just glued on it! I was so shocked and returned it the next day. This should have been recalled.",1
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"I love this gate! I promise if you purchase this product it will not be a disappointment. It is easy to handle and convenient. I use it by my stairway. The great thing is that I have older children, ages 9 &amp; 5, they have no problem opening gate. There may be some cheaper gates you could purchase, but I think it is worth the extra money to know you will be happy.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"Just a tip - after searching the web, looking for the very best price for this gate (especially since we need four of them!), I called my local Target store to see if they carry them.  They do, & lo & behold, they charge $... for them (same as the best price on the web), except that you just have to pay tax, not shipping (which can be $... on line).  And, you can pick it up today, rather than waiting for them to ship it to you.Just thought someone would like to know.",4
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"This gate is pretty good for indoor use.  I have a 21 month old that is into everything and she has not been able to get over or through this gate yet.  The gate does not hold up well in the weather, so for outdoor use like decks it's not very good.  The wood swells and the bottom portion does not go into the slot.  Would recommend for indoor use but not outdoor",4
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"We've been fighting with our pressure lock gate at the top of the stairs for about 2 years now. We finally decided to look for a replacement and this seemed like a good choice. Reading previous reviews gave us a good idea what we were getting into with installation. (Thanks everyone!) Armed with that knowledge, we were able to install the gate with little difficulty. The template is useless if you have molding, as predicted. To my mind, the wood doesn't seem as sturdy as I'd have liked. We have the gate essentially to prevent accidental falls, and it's good enough for that. It is not hard to open or close. Anyone getting fingers pinched isn't paying enough attention to what they're doing, imo. I can't say if I'd recommend it for a high traffic area, since that's not where ours is, and I don't know how it would stand up to normal toddler abuse. But as a safety net, this gate is a good choice.orig review date: 2007, updated July 2013-- this gate is still in place! No problems with it whatsoever. That's a good value!",4
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"We bought this for the top of our stairs leading to the basement and it works great. I looked on Counsmer Reports.com and this was a best buy for a mounted gate. We tried it and love it, we know our little is now safe. It is also so easy to use because we frequently go down the stairs because we have a finished basement. Safe and eay to use, you can't beat that!",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"Overall this is a very good gate. It is made of wood, it is VERY sturdy and the 4-point hardware makes sure it will not be knocked down as pressure mounted gates. It does not have that bottom bar that some gates have, so there is no chance of tripping over that.The only negative thing is the opening mechanism. You have to unlatch it and slide the gate in and that is not as easy as it sounds. Sometimes you need to use both hands to use it. The positive side is that there is no way a kid would open that latch.",4
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"This baby gate is AWESOME!!! It is so easy to install and its function is flawless. The fact that it both swings and slides makes it so versatile as to where it can be placed. It is so strong my 2 year old will climb up onto it and shake it violently and it has stood up to these conditions for over a year!!! This is a home run as far as baby gates go, it is great for both the top and bottom of stairs, too. A++.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"If you have a baby and stairs, this is the gate you want.  I have the gate installed at the top of my stairway and it works perfectly.  My son likes grab hold of the bars and &quot;shake&quot; the gate. The constructions holds extremely well, so he doesn't go tumbling down the stairs.  I love the fact it is easy for adults to open and close the gate.  The swing out option is plus also.  I would highly recommend this gate.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,This is a very simple and sturdy gate. Very easy to use one handed. We put the second one at the door to our child's room. It's easy to be quiet shutting this gate.  I've recommended this gate to my friends already.,5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"This gate is at the bottom of my stairs.  It wasn't quite wide enough so I screwed blocks of 2x4s into the wall for the extra couple inches rather than shell out any more money for a wider gate.  I love it. The natural wood looks good (granted no gate is ""designer"" ha) and it operates easily.  I carry the vaccum cleaner and big suitcases up and down the stairs and wanted a gate to give me a large threshold.  I also like it easily pops off its hinges but leaves the hardware in teh wall for when family is in town or what have you.Installation was simple with the template and we got a solid install with the wood against the wall.  It sure was tested a lot this weekend during a 2 year old birthday party, but the gate won.  I would highly recommend",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"The BabiesRUs store I went to did not have one out of the box to look at, so I went off of what I could tell on the box.  Once I got it home, a few things became obvious.  First, it would not work with my stairs due to the lack of a stud in the proper place on the wall side.  I realize that is not a design flaw in the product and just an incompatibility.  However, I also found it to be a poor design.  When the gate was open, the two pieces would freely slide in and out from each other.  Due to the space between the two pieces, it presented an obvious pinching hazard to little fingers and adult fingers alike.",2
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,It took until my son was 4 years old to figure out how to open the gate on his own.  I have one at the top of the stairs and one for the kitchen.  Two slats have recently broken off but the gate withstood 3 boys for 5 years.  Slats were repaired with glue but keep coming off.  I am purchasing the same gate as a replacment.,5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"I have been through many types of gates for use with small children and animals.  I've used accordian and plastic and have found that this gate works best.  When mounted, it has no pipe to trip on, doesn't fall out of the door, expands to fit in some hard to believe applications and lasts for  years.  In our house, there are five installed.  You can buy extra wall mounting pieces at Evenflo.com, allowing you to buy one gate and use it in several places around your home.  The gate easily slides out of the metal brackets and just as easily slides back in.  This one can't be beat!",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"Awesome gate.  It is sturdy, so its very well fit for use on top of stairs. Some people might have trouble opening and closing it, since it has a very childproof mechanism.  You have to press on the spring loaded latch from the bottom, then slide the gate out, then swing it.  Its easier than it seems..although, I would avoid the gate if you have arthritis or other finger joint isse.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"I am the mother of two babies age two and one. They both climb. I have a tension gate with the wonderful holes that they can stick their toes in and climb over and that leaves those wonderful marks on the drywall or doorframe. Since the older of the babies has learned to turn knobs, we found it neccesary to purchase an additional gate for the top of our stairs to the basement. I needed to be able to go up and down easily and not have the babies able to climb it. I purchased this gate, and in 20-30 minutes I had it up and useable. It has been in place for 8 months and they still can't open it or climb it, and I am able to take laundry up without having to set it down to opperate the locking mechanism. We have decided to purchase an additional gate to replace our tension gate in the bedroom. From our most recent experience with this model, we will purchase an identical gate. We have been extreemly pleased.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,This gate is sturdy and easy to install.  Because our walls have baseboards I had to cut a frame to install the gate on.  The frame is a a 2x4 notched at the bottom to fit around the baseboard.  The gate expands to 42 inches but I also installed it in a 48 inch wide hallway by using a 2x4 mounted on a 2x6 frame.  I originally had an Eddie Bauer Wood Gate (10 minutes then took it down) but installed this in its place because I did not realize that the EB gate did not retract.  Once the EB gate is set to the hallway width it stays that size while this gate expands and retracts.,5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"I have four different gates in my house, and this, by far, is the most secure and stable. Therefore, it's at the top of my stairs... the most important place. I feel like I could even sit on that gate, and it's no going to budge.When we have guests over, they have trouble opening it, because you have to squeeze really hard, but I like that I have to squeeze really hard... it keeps my child who is now a clever 3.5 year old from being able to open it do this day.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"I purchased this for the top of a stair way. I love it. Installation was easy. Opening and closing is so easy (even my 6 year old and 11 year old have no trouble). For the cost, it is a very sturdy and excellent gate.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"We bought one for the top and one for the bottom and they work great, no complaints.  Only wish I could have gotten them in white but that's not a big deal.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,The gate took about 15 minutes to install. It is very sturdy and looks nice.,4
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"I have not had a problem with the bottom popping out like another poster mentioned. I wonder if the wall was slightly wider at the bottom from the house settling.  I am very happy with it, though one word of caution.  We noticed that the holes on the template don't line up with the ones on the gate, so you might as well chuck the template and go it alone.  We have a few extra holes in the wall because of it.  I love the fact that you can take it right off the wall when not in use, without having to mess around with the hardware.",4
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"I bought this gate for use at the top of my basement stairs which are open. Not only do I have a five month old to look out for but I also have 2 rambunctious 2 year old nephews who are always over, both ""master climbers"". Besides the fact that they couldn't even attempt to climb it, they defintely couldn't open it. Sometimes it's hard for me to open, and that's not to say it's a bad thing - if it were too easy for me, they'd find a way to open it themselves. It doesn't touch the floor, so there's no bump to have to walk over - something I was looking for specifically in a gate. Some reviews mention a difficult installation but my husband had no problems at all - he said just make sure you find a beam to screw into.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"After reading the other reviews, I chose and installed this gate at the top of the stairs to our finished basement.  Like most of the other reviewers, I found the gate to be very sturdy when in the locked position and I feel safe that my 13 month-old daughter will not be able to break through it, climb over it, or figure out how to open it for quite a while yet anyway!  Also I didn't have much trouble installing the gate by myself, although the directions weren't the greatest.However this is the only gate rated for stairwells that I have examined and I have to say that I am very disappointed in the quality of the one-way swing mechanism.  It consists of a little piece that screws into the top of the gate, where when it comes into contact with the top hinge, is supposed to keep the gate from opening into the stairwell.  I found it to be very weak and mostly will pose only as a reminder not to try to open the gate that way.  I would NOT trust it one bit to block my little one's fall, if she were to push against the unlocked gate.  That is what I had hoped--that it would be a second-line of defense.  (I believe it could not sustain a push of much greater than 5 or 10 pounds of force or a toddler could push right on through.)The most important thing that I was looking for was for it to be secure when it was in the ""locked"" position and I DO feel good about that.  So overall, I give the gate 4 stars.",4
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"We bought a few of these gates after our son began to climb the other gates we had. These wooden gates are a bit more expensive but are well worth the price. They are easy to install, heavy duty, better looking and vitually impossible to climb over. We feel much saver with them on the stairs.  Our previous gates were made of plastic and were the type with the large &quot;holes&quot; in them. When our son began to pull up to standing we noticed the plastic gates swayed and twisted a bit. A few weeks later he figured out how to get his little feet in the holes and climbed to the top of the gate. Spend the little extra to get a gate that will last and will keep your climber safe.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"This gate was easy to install, and the latch is easy to use. The piece that is supposed to allow the gate to only swing one way didn't work for us. It seemed that with a little bit of pressure, you could hear the wood cracking, so we just decided not to use it. Maybe we didn't install the piece correctly. I would recommend this gate and buy it again.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"This is a much better gate than the plastic varieties. I did encounter two issues when installing this gate. Firstly, there were no studs in the wall where I needed to mount it. Secondly, the width of the baseboards meant that the bottom mounting brackets were 3/4's of an inch on each side closer than the top ones. I managed to solve both these issues by  screwing 3/4 inch strips of plywood into the wall studs, then bolting (not screwing) the top brackets to the ply. Screwing the ply to the studs was sufficient because all of the pressure that our little guy would put on the gate would be at right angles. Bolting the brackets and using washers prevents it from tearing out.I am suprised that the manufacturer did not include alternative mounting instructions, considering every house I've ever seen has had some kind of baseboard. (Perhaps the wanted to avoid being sued, especially in the litigious-happy U.S of A.!)",4
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,We have 4 of these gates and love them.  It is SO easy to install and SO super easy to use!  I had a professional baby proofer come to my house and he saw my gates and said this was the gate he recommends as well.  I can open and close it with one hand - it looks nice - and is very safe.  I keep trying to convince my friends to get this gate so I will have no troubles when I visit them - those other gates confuse me and are hard to use.  This is truly the only you will need.,5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"It's hard to open, even harder to close.  I'm afraid I won't latch it correctly and there goes the baby down the stairs!  Trying to slide the ends into the slots everytime I close it is a pain.  One handed operation is nearly impossible.  AND - it's really not all that nice looking.",1
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,This was easy to install and easy to use. You can carry your child in one arm and open it with another. I feel safe with this gate at the top of my stairs.,5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"We installed this gate at the top of our stairs and are so happy with it that I just bought two more for other places in our house.  It installs quickly, and is easy to use.  It has a low profile and just lifts off the brackets if you want to have it totally out of the way.  Its sturdy and can be opened and closed with one hand.  I'd definately recommend it.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"This is a nice gate for a door opening, probably not the best choice for a stairway. We found it easy to install and is well made.  I don't know how some people found this to be junky.  The wood looks nice, too. Gates are a barrier not a babysitter, so for the price we found this to be good for door openings to our hallway.",4
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"Very pleased with these gates.  I have 2 of them in my house and my mother has another.  They all work good and greatly help keep the kiddo where he should be.  They could be a lit more rugged and the latch could be a little more user friendly, but neither of those things are that big of a deal.",4
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"I have this gate at the bottom of my stairs and I love it.  The best feature is that when the gate is open and not in use, the gate retracts so you can still walk by it easily.  I have and prefer a metal gate at the top of my stairs, but I am sure this gate would be fine.  The gate was easy to install and is easy to remove and put back up....just a flip of 2 hinges.  The locking latch has pinched my fingers a few times, but it is worth it.  I highly recommend this gate.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"We use this gate for a 36"" opening at the top of our stairs.  The gate is sturdy, and opens easily with one hand.Installing this gate alone seemed like it could get a bit tricky, especially if you want everything 90 degrees to the floor and level across the top.  Fortunately my father-in-law helped me out.We ended up mounting a 1""T x 4""W x 30""L piece of wood to both sides of the wall (these were mounted into studs) to guarantee that the mounting hardware would be screwed into wood (in case the mounting hardware screws missed the stud due to the 1-2"" offset between the swinging and latching sides of the gate).If installing this on a wall with molding, keep in mind that the bottom screw hole of the latch side hardware is the lowest screw mounting point . . . otherwise you will end up installing this screw through the molding like we had to.  FYI, our molding is 2"" high and we installed the gate 2"" off the ground.  If we had installed the gate 3"" off the ground (maximum height recommended by the manufacturer) we probably would not have run into this problem.For the price, I don't think there is a better permanent mount gate out there.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"I love this gate!  I have nothing bad to say about it.  We installed it at the top of the stairs.  It can be easily taken on and off the hinges, so its nice to not have the gate up when you don't need it.  And you can fix it so that it swings open like a door in one direction.  The latch is easy enough for adults, but still hard for my 3 year old daughter to open, which is nice so that she doesn't open it and forget to shut it back.  She's stuck at the top of the stairs right along with the baby!  This was a good investment for the safety of my baby.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"For the price of this gate I expected much more quality wise. My husband put the gate up at the top of the stairs on our landing, and followed the directions to a T. Well whenever we would be upstairs my daughter would stand on the gate and shake it with all of her might, and of course being the stubborn 19 months she is, I could not get her to stop doing this. Well after two weeks of doing this the part of the gate that attaches to the wall (the part that swings) ripped out of the wall. How a 2 yr old could do this I am not sure. My husband put it up again with larger anchors and screws but it looks like it is going to come out again.For $35 I expect much more.",2
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"I bought this gate for my 104 year old house and 18 month old cyclone.  This gate not only keeps her where she should be but looks good and works great.  She pulls, pushes, and tries to figure out how to get over, around, or under it but can't.  Looks great and holds up great.  All around winner.",5
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,I think this is a great gate for the price.  The instructions are no help though so you are on your own to figure out how to set it up.  The natural wood makes it inconspicuous and I really like the simple design.,4
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"This is a solid, easy to install gate that actually fit out 45"" wide stairs. My wife had it put up in minutes. It strong, easy to open and keeps the kids in. We ended up buying two and they're worth the purchase.",4
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,Very nice product ... quality is good and it was a gift to my nephew on his birthday and he loved it.,5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,my nephew loves dinosaurs and his BIG tub of dinosaurs! He plays with them all the time! A great toy.,5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,Did not meet my expectations. I guess you get what you pay for. The product was smaller than advertised. My 2 year old likes it and that's all that matters .,2
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,This product seemed a bit high priced but the dino's are well made and will last forever.  My grandsons use floor puzzles as a background rather than the flimsy plastic that comes with this but it has lots of pieces and will do for several children to play with at a time.  I paper with names of different dinos would have been nice also.  Overall good purchase.,4
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,I got this for my little nephew for his birthday.  He loves it.  I like especially that it comes in a tub and everything goes back inside the tub when they are done playing.  The dino's are a decent size but not large.  The little rocks and trees can be placed where the child want to put them.  A good gift.,4
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"This was a last minute Christmas purchase for my 5 year old daughter who loves dinosaurs.  She has a few plastic ones that she plays with from time to time, so I really wasn't thinking about getting any more... Then I saw this item and thought she'd have some fun with it.  To my surprise, this has become her favorite thing to play with; even beyond other items, including a karaoke machine and a kids tablet stocked with e-books and games.  It is so nice to watch her acting out various scenarios with her community of dinos.  I couldn't have imagined how much fun she'd have.  The dinosaurs are well made, nice coloring and features.  Good variety.  The mat, volcanoes, trees and rocks are a nice touch, sometimes she uses these, other times she just lines the dinos up by family on our living room coffee table and acts out various social situations between the dinos.  I love seeing her pretend play!  Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs has turned out to be a delightful surprise.",5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"My 2-1/2 year old son got this playset for Christmas. He LOVES it. To challenge his mind, the name of each dinosaur is printed on the bottom. I can see that we are going to get hours of endless play with this set! Great job Animal Planet! We have two birthdays in January for friends turning 3...they will both be getting this set.",5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"I bought this for my 2 year old grandson and he absolutely loves it  He has spent hours playing with all of the dinorsaurs, trees, etc.",5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,The dinosaurs are great.  The concept is good.  One of the trees was broken as they are a bit flimsy but that didn't really affect it overall.  I also wish the mat wasn't so thin.  My kids like playing with it.,4
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"I bought these for my Grandson for Christmas.  He has not stopped playing with them since.  He uses the mat, but also will take them when traveling in the car.  They seem to be very durable too, so they can also be played with outdoors, which will be nice in the summer.",5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"I purchased this set for my son's 2nd birthday.  I'm sure he will like it but I don't really feel like we got the quality, we paid for ($29).  The paint job on each piece reminds me of Dollar store toys, the mat is flimsy plastic (I won't be giving this to my son as it's a suffocation hazard), and the dinosaurs are very small.  I do like the fact they have their own tote/ box and all fit in nicely.  I will say that by looking at the picture, there's a little trick photography used - I should've paid closer attention to the details rather than the reviews.",2
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"My almost-4 granddaughter is dyno-crazed.  This was a Thanksgiving gift - when I got home, it had arrived and was set up in the kitchen.  The variety is great for this age - different species in different sizes.  The &#34;rocks&#34; are not necessary and will probably gradually disappear, but the volcanoes are awesome!  The fact that the &#34;map&#34; is simple plastic does not matter at all. The fact that the box picture matches the map and the dynos is very important to little Bea.  Tub is compact, holds everything with no room to spare, and has a carry handle that actually works for little ones.  Wish there was a matching Savanna and Outback...",5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"I think this a fine learning/play item, but found the exact same thing at Toys R Us for $19.99. I rate the toy as substantially good, but the price is WAY TOO HIGH on this site.",1
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,this is a cute little set and makes a great gift! Everything comes in a tub so you get storage. I picked a coupld of these up for my kids as well as an extra for a neighbor's son. Both boys and girls will love this set if they love playing with dinosaurs!,5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"I really wasn't expecting this to be a very popular toy for kids these days, but I got this for my 4yo daughter who has shown interest in rubber dinosaurs. She really loves it and plays with it daily.Only complaints is the little plastic trees break and the mat is a plastic sheet is pretty much garbage after a 4yo gets ahold of it.",4
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"My two year old son keeps one to five of these with him at all times. He brings them to the bathtub, dinner table, carseat, park, bed. There's a Grandpa, Littlefoot, Sarah, sharptooth. No Petri though.",5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"I purchased for my Grandson who is really into dinosaurs right now. His response, &#34;this is the best toy ever!'.",5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"Gift for grandchild heard it is really nice, good quality.  A good buy for the money.  My grandson loves it!!!",5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,I bought these for my grandson who loved dinosaurs at the time.  He has outgrown them but still has them.  It was a great gift and well worth the money.,5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"got this for my daughters 4th bday. shes developed a love for dinosaurs, which I love because I loved them growing up too! they come in a nice big tote she can carry around and makes for easy clean up. the dinosaurs come in all sizes and seem very durable. the mat was kinda flimsy and not really what I was expecting but for the price and as many pieces you get, I cant knock any stars off. the dinosaurs will probably spend more time in the bath tub and around the house rather then on the mat anyways.",5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"some kids have favorite toys which they can grow out of, get bored with etc..  The fun with this play set is, no matter how young or old your child is, if they like dinosaurs the fun is endless with this playset.. there is so many different varities of dino's to choose from that its hard to choose your favorite, also, the accessories add the imagination of real life dino atmosphere...  They can learn about the different species, what they ate, who could fly, swim, who was bigger, faster.. etc... this is an awsome all round toy..",5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,My son loved them!  They're a little smaller than I thought they were gonna be. But my son was still happy.,4
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"My son loves to play ""dino world"" just about every day!! The tub is great for storing the set & theres plenty of room for more things.  We keep a bunch of blocks and small cars in there to add tothe scene and creative play.  The mat it comes with is kind of a joke , lasting maybe one day.  But that's no reason to not buy this.Like others, we purchased thise elsewhere for MUCH less than the 60-something Amazon is currently selling it.",5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"The dinosaurs are very good quality.  Only complaint (very minor) about them is that the names of the dinosaurs are VERY hard to read...but this was fixed by my husband smudging some pernament marker on them and then whiping it off lightly with acetone to create some contrast with the letters.The volcanos, trees, and rocks are great too.  Love the storage bin.  The mat that comes with, however, leave MUCH to be desired...I'd almost rather it not have come with it.  The mat is super cheap looking and not durable at all.Overall, however, this is a great product that my 4 year old son is enjoying greatly!",4
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"I purchased this for a little boy I've never met because he had it on his wish list. He has cancer and it was his birthday, and he loves dinosaurs. His mom took a picture of him playing with it and he had a big smile on his face, so I think he liked it.",5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"This is a great product for 3 year olds.  My son loves it.  However, the thing I did not like about it is the play mat it came with.  The mat is way too small.  I was expecting the mat to be a thicker plastic, but it is maybe the quality of a plastic bag or slightly thicker.",4
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"My children now 2 & 4 years old got this toy for Christmas last year, 2001.  It's now about a year later and they still play with this set.  We're constantly picking up dinosaurs, or looking for dinosaurs because somebody wants to sleep with one or bring one in the car.  They play with them in the sandbox, in their bed, in the car, and often is their toy of choice to go along when we're visiting somewhere.  Most of our toys are played with once a month or less but the dinosaurs are an almost daily thing.  Definitely got our moneys worth.  The plastic playmat is not durable.  Ours is not torn yet but it gets attention about once a month compared to the rest of the set's constant use.",5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"This is a decent set of toys, not very engaging other than the dinosaurs look cool.  The storage box is good for obvious reasons.  The mat is worthless.",4
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,I bought this product for my nephew for his 3rd Birthday and he loves it. Mom & Dad tell me it is very durable and he loves it. Hours of play time. I would purchase it again.,5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"This is an awesome complete set of dinosaurs toys, great price. We were very satisfied with overall quality of toys.",5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,My 4 year old Grandson loved this set. It comes with a great storage box with plenty of room for more dinosaurs.,5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,My son had a great time with this set. The only thing I didnt' like about it was the play mat. I thought it was way larger it is pretty tiny. My son still likes it so I guess that is all that matters.,4
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"I ended ordering this for my nephews for Christmas and they absolutely loved it (according to my sister!) I had to ship it to them since they live in the West Coast and I in the East Coast. It got shipped immediately and they actually received it right on time! They liked the fact that they saw a huge box and no idea what was inside and then to their surprise, dinosaurs!Would highly recommend this set!",5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"I gave this to my 2 yr old grand-nephew on his birthday at a local pizza place where the party was held.  I can't rave enough about it! The first words out of his mouth were &#34;WHOA!! WOW! DINOSAURS! WHOA!&#34;  He immediately spread out the set under the table and every child that was part of the party and many who weren't started playing with it, ages 2 to 12! I had to repeatedly  tell mothers from the other tables where I bought it and how much it cost. Some of the children tried to walk away with pieces from the set, and I had to police the party.  I did feel really bad for some of the other Aunts, Uncles, Grandmothers and Friends who were just as hopeful that their presents were just as enthralling, but sadly were not.  If you want to see the child in your life eyes light up, BUY IT!",5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,My 3 1/2 year old is dinosaur-obsessed and loves this set. It allows them to create their own little valley for the dinosaurs and let their imaginations go wild. I would definitely recommend.,5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,This was a gift and it was a big hit.  He's 4 yrs old and loves them.  His mom has decided to keep them in ziplock bags to help with the storage.,5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,My grandson likes this toy very much. He has already played with it a LOT. What kid doesn't like dinosaurs.,4
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,This is a great learning tool for young kids to learn about dinosaurs. I love it and so does my son. The only thing to change is the little map. It is very cheap  and rips easily.,4
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,My Grandson was really excited about his new dinosaurs.  He doesn't even want to share with his little sister because they are so special to him.,5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,Picture makes it look like the mat is very large and well made. In reality the mat is not printed even with the same pattern and is made of a very thin plastic almost like plastic wrap. The dinosaurs are not that detailed and light weight plastic as well. For the money I was not happy with my purchase.,2
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"MI HIJO AMA LOS DINOSAURIOS ASI QUE DECIDI COMPRARLE ESTE SET, LO MALO ESQUE EN  LA FOTO SE MIRAN MAS GRANDES CUANDO EN REALIDAD NO LO ES. :( SON MAS PEQUENOS QUE LO QUE SE MIRA EN LA FOTO ES UNA DECILUCION PARA MI PORQUE EL QUERIA UNOS MAS GRANDES.",5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,I bought this for my lil cousin who loves dinosaurs. I was very excited to find this. But ones I got the package I was disappointed with how small it was. Now I don't even want to give it to him. I don't recommend it not worth the price.,3
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"Bought this toy (or rather the version they had then) for my daughter when she was 2. She played with it for years and is now playing with her 2-year old brother. They managed to rip the plastic scenery (arguing on who got to play with it) and tear apart some of the palm trees, he also cracked one of the volcanoes by jumping off the bed and straight on it, but the dinosaurs have survived all sorts of mishandling and rough play. The bucket is miraculously whole considering that it has also been used as step-stool, seat and pretend bath for dolls.The fact that the dinosaurs have their names printed on the belly (not easy to read) gives me the opportunity to tell them their real names, and learn for myself too!All in all, the most used toy in our home. I dare say one of them has played with the dinosaurs almost every day since we purchased them three years ago. They are the first toy out and the last back in.I would buy this again and look forward to giving it as a gift too.",5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"This was a birthday gift for my son, and he LOVED it!  I would definitely recommend the toy.  The dinosaur's names (triceratops, etc.) are printed on the bottoms of the figures, which is great if you're like me and don't know some of the more obscure names.I scored this as a 3 because of the condition it arrived in, not the toy itself.  I would recommend ordering this enough in advance that you would have time to open and check it out before giving as a gift.  We didn't have enough time and after opening the cardboard box, found that the plastic container was shattered on one side and the handle was broken off.  The shipping box looked perfectly fine, so it is hard to say how the toy made it into the box in that condition.  It was also missing a part (a tree, so not that big of deal but still...).My son didn't want to give it up to return it, which is a great sign!  We were able to talk him into it, mostly because he would have had to throw away the bin with its sharp/broken edges and handle.  It was a little inconvenient to return and reorder/wait for a new product, but he loves the toy so it was worth it.",3
8&quot; Tinkle Crinkle Baby Caterpillar Rattle Toy- Pastel,"I know that this is a baby rattle, but our 9-month-old kitten (&#34;Tigger&#34;) fell in love with an older version of this and nearly tore it apart.  So, when I found this one on Amazon.com, I jumped at ordering two of them.It's not uncommon to see Tigger carrying his caterpillar rattle around the house, stopping and rolling over with it in play mode from time to time.Great product for a great price.",4
8&quot; Tinkle Crinkle Baby Caterpillar Rattle Toy- Pastel,"This toy was much smaller than I expected it to be, and I could not make it crinkle. I don't think it does. That was disappointing as that was the main reason we bought it. We were giving it to a baby in a ""goodie bag"" at my daughter's birthday party. We ended up having to get another gift because this looked too puny to give on it's own. It's cute looking, and it's a rattle, so babies would still like it. I would probably spring for the big one next time though, if I buy it at all.",2

"NUK 2 Pack Classic Latex BPA Free Pacifier, Size 2","Hard to find Latex Nuk Pacifier---so glad you were carrying these. My grand son really dislikes the clear ones and my kids were raised on these, too.",5
"NUK 2 Pack Classic Latex BPA Free Pacifier, Size 2","I am mother of 4, grandmother of 3... Best pacifier around! Size 2 is good for the most months, latex is most easily accepted by newborns and breast fed babies, and Nuk is most natural shape. I wish these were more available, but worth the search!",5
"NUK 2 Pack Classic Latex BPA Free Pacifier, Size 2","The description clearly says that the Nuks will be red or white or blue. I received pink and purple.  I don't really mind my son using a pink binky, but I am very disappointed not to receive what was described.",1
"NUK 2 Pack Classic Latex BPA Free Pacifier, Size 2",No complaints. Nuk is a good product. My baby takes every pacy. Easy to clean or just throw them in the bottle sanitizer.,4
"NUK 2 Pack Classic Latex BPA Free Pacifier, Size 2","I can't find Size 2 in latex in any store, so Amazon it is! This is the only bink my 9 month old has ever taken and she absolutely will not settle for the newer silicone binks. It has a slightly larger nipple than the Size 1, so she is able to keep it in her mouth easier now that she herself is bigger. I've ordered this product 3 times now and gotten a package of blue/green one time and pink/purple the other two times. We don't mind or prefer any color, as long as she keeps liking them! These do need replacing every 6-8 weeks (or longer, if you try to stretch it like me) as the latex wears down and becomes sticky.",5

"NUK 2 Pack Fashion Latex BPA Free Pacifier, Size 3 \nColors May Vary",I specifically ordered these 18-36 month nuks because my nearly two year old still insists on a pacifier at bedtime.  The pacifiers that came were 0-6 months which I cannot use.,1
"NUK 2 Pack Fashion Latex BPA Free Pacifier, Size 3 \nColors May Vary","These pacifiers are gigantic.

Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"Don't get me wrong, I do like this walker.  We bought it for my 7 month old, whenever he would get in it he loved it.  Except that the legs(the part that makes it taller) wouldn't stay in the groves, and kept falling to the floor.  So he wasn't able to walk in it.  He is in the 95% in height, but only 60 in weight.  There was no reason for this to happen.But like I said I do like the Walker...Just not very sturdy..expecially for bigger babies.",4
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,this is absolutely fabulous.  My 5 mo old daughter loves her car and speeds around the house in it.  She loves to follow me around the house.  It is a bit hard to manuever on carpet.,5
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"We received this walker as a shower gift.  After hearing mixed reviews about the safety of walkers I was hesitant to let my son use it.  When he was about 4 1/2 months old we put him in it for the first time, and he loved it! The activity tray has a great variety of toys.  We also really like the fact that the tray comes off and he can put other toys or Cheerios on it. This walker is very stable and well made. At 10 months my son cruises around the house a record speeds and is just about ready to walk on his own.  This toy has really let him explore the house safely.  We all love it.",5
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"We bought this for our daughter when she was 8 mths. old.  She never took a liking to it.  She started walking on her own at 10 1/2 so this was something that was used myabe twice & definitely didn't need to be purchaed.I'm not a believer in using walkers anyway but you can take the wheels off to make it stationary for play, which is what we mostly did.It is a good product but I don't think I would buy another walker again because I don't find them functional or entertaining.The only complaint that I can say is that the wheels would fall off all the time when the walker was moved.",4
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"This item is great! We have tile floors &amp; my daughter has been zipping around the house since she was 4 months old. It is bulky enough to keep her at arm's length from harm (like outlets &amp; stuff on the coffee table). The noise-maker on top can be removed &amp; played with on the floor (or use the walker w/o the noise). It keeps her off the floor which is constantly scattered w/ dirt &amp; rocks tracked in from outside. It gives her a sense of independence &amp; me a sense of security, knowing that she can walk off &amp; not get into too much trouble!",5
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"we bought this walker when my son was 4 months old. he loved the activity tray right out of the box and tried to eat the star and rocket. we lived in a small apartment at the time and he could only go backwards at first in our very tiny kithchen. when he was 5 months old we moved into our new house which has mostly tile and watch out! he was going everywhere and giggling the whole time. when his legs got a little stronger he could even go on the carpet. we never had a problem with this walker. we could easily remove the seat to wash it, the stoppers always worked, and when it was time to adjust the height it was easy and worked just fine. even at 10 months when he could walk he would still push the walker from the spoiler or play with the activity tray in front. he never got hurt (i would watch him always) he never got bored, and only our cats were bothered. this  walker is worth any price. i finally put it away when he was about 13 months old (he still played with it from the outside for 3 months after he could walk) and am saving it for the next baby!",5
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"My daughter likes the sounds and interaction with the toy, but gets frustrated that she is ""trapped"" and can't roll easily on carpet.",4
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"We chose to get this for our daughter instead of an exasaucer because this allowed her the freedom to move around the room.We bought it as a Christmas gift but a month before, we couldn't wait to try it out any longer!  So she started using it at three months.  Her feet didn't touch the floor but she could hold her head sturdy, so we just propped a rolled up blanket in the front for her.  She used it up untul about 8 months when she started to crawl and toddle around.It's a great unit!  Well worth the money and easy to clean too.",5
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,My twins love it.  Larger wheels allow it to roll over the groves/mortar between stones of kitchen floor better than older walker we have.,5
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,My Grandson age 10 months of age enjoy the versitility of both the Tot Wheels Activity Center.  The bright colors and interactive ""gadgets"" keep him entertained as well as teach them how to influence his environment.  I also have a granddaughter (6 Months old)will have a similar experience (she is starting to already). It is safe and is in the process of learning cause and effect.,5
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"After considering my choices between other walkers and stationary saucers, I bought this walker.  Our son has been using it for about a month and he loves it!  He's only 4 1/2 months (but very big and strong for his age), and he speeds across the kitchen floor... watch our for your toes and the cat lying on the floor!  The wide base of the walker makes it impossible to be tipped. The arm on the back makes it easy to move the walker from room to room when the baby is not in it.  Right now we put toys on the see-through tray for our son to play with.  In another month or so we'll add the activity tray and our son will think he has a whole new toy.  The only drawback we've found it that our son can't move it on the carpet (not sure if that's typical of all walkers or if our son just isn't strong enough yet).  The option of making the walker stationary is a nice feature as it can be used for a feeding chair; however, our son knows that the walker can move and gets upset when he can't move it, so the stationary feature probably won't get any use by us.  If you're looking for a sturdy, entertaining walker, this one is well worth the money.",5
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"We got this for our son when he was about 4 months old, mainly because he was only happy in the standing position and our arms were exhausted!  What a life (and arm!) saver!  My son was ALWAYS happy when he was in his walker.  The car was fun for him to play with, he was able to have some independance and what I loved was that the toy part came off, so he could have snacks on the go.  I actually fed him a couple of meals in this when he was just too fidgety to sit in the high chair.  The cushioned seat is realatively easy to remove (by an adult), so whenever needed, it could be thrown in the washing machine.  Now that our daughter is 4 months old, she's about ready to start hanging out in there (we've got another one who's only happy when standing!).  I deffinately recomend this walker!",5
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"I absolutly love this walker.  We had bought a saucer, than we got one of those old walkers that was smaller and plain, than we bought this one a month ago when my daughter was 7 months old, and i wish i had done that in the beginning. The wheels are bigger than most and work a lot better so your little can get around, and it works great on carpet, any kind of carpet. And the toys on top keeps your child entertained while still letting them have a tray for other toys or food. The only down side is its bigger than the other one. I highly recommend though.",5
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,This tot wheels activity center has brought nothing but headaches for me and my family. First reason being my son would play in all the time. On a couple occasions my 5 year old daughter would grab on to the spoiler to turn my son around and he would get ejected from the seat of the walker on to his head on the floor. Second reason being the wheel part broke off of the activity part and left very sharp edges. I dont know about anyone else but my son was always chewing on the wheel. The third and most terrifing reason being my sonwas playing with the walker when he managed to get his head stuck in between the spoiler and the tray. There was no way to get him out and i was so nervous I didn't have the strength to pop the spoiler out of the tray. Thank god I didn't because the parrimedics had to come. when they came one of them mentioned popping it out and a few of them said no because of how my son was stuck it could have snapped his neck. Therefore the walker had to be cut to release him. I STRONGLY RECOMEND ANYONE LOOKING TO BUY A WALKER STAY AWAY FROM THIS PARTICULAR STYLE !!,1
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"This walker is great for tall babies like my son and the toys are enough to keep him busy.  The only issue I have with it is that the legs don't have a very strong system for holding the walker up on it's different levels.  It is made like an exersaucer rather than having ""x"" bars to go up and down, and one of the back legs won't stay in position.  While it could be an isolated issue, the plastic seems more flimsy than it should be.  Also, only the front wheels swivel which I didn't think was a big deal, but it does seem to hinder my son from going in any direction he wants at a given time.",3
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"My husband and I bought this walker for our son when he was four months old.  (I know that he was a little young, but he liked to stand and you can only hold a baby in a standing position for so long.)  He absolutely loves it!  We have had it for a month now and he can make it go all over my dining room.  All of the sounds are great.  He is figuring out how to make them work on his own and gets very excited.  The walker is very sturdy and well balanced.  The walker is making him feel more independent everyday.This was a great purchase!!!",5
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"My daughter just received this walker as a gift.  It is so loud that I had to place pieces of cardboard and tape over the speaker on the bottom.  It also will not turn easily.  It will go forwards and backwards, but not to either side.  I have NEVER heard a baby toy that was so loud!!  I think if they added a volume button on this walker it would be great.  It would also be helpful if they redesigned how the walker turns.",2
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"My husband originally bought this for out 4 month old son but he was too young for it so rather than keep it around ( it's rather big) we returned it.  I had my heart set on one of the mega saucers because they seemed to have so many more activities but my husband re bought this tot wheels when my son turned 6 months. I'm glad he did!  Those 2 months sure made a difference.  He loves this ""car"".  He zooms around the house chasing after the dogs and to watch him, it is hilarious.  The car makes a sound like when a dump truck backs up and you would swear that he knows what he is doing.  Everytime he backs up, he turns around and pulls the yellow lever which makes the signal sound.  The dogs quickly get out of his way. It has a nice wide base yet is still maneuverable.  The cloth seat seems to be very comfortable and it is easy to get his legs in the holes in the first try.  The wide base also keeps him from getting into too much trouble by preventing him from reaching too far.  The cloth star is a favorite feature that he loves to suck on. The wheels also go well over carpet.  One draw back is that the mirror seems to reflect in his face sometimes & it also reflects the flash when you try to take pics of him in it.  I would recommend this in a heart beat.",5
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"I PLACED THIS ON MY REGISTRY FOR OUR FOURTH BABY. WE HAD PURCHASED AN EXERSAUCER FOR OUR THIRD SON, WHICH HE EASILY BECAME BORED WITH. OUR NEWEST SON IS EXPLORING THINGS, FOLLOWING HIS BROTHERS--HAVING A GRAND TIME! YOU CAN'T BELIEVE HOW QUICKLY THEY GET THE HANG OF THIS (first put him in at 5 mos). HAVING 4 BOYS, I'VE SEEN AND BOUGHT IT ALL, AND I SUGGEST WALKERS OVER EXERSAUCERS. WHO COULD SIT WITH THE SAME TOYS WHEN THERE IS AN ENTIRE HOUSE TO EXPLORE?! OF COURSE, EXTREME SUPERVISION IS REQUIRED WITH WALKERS...BABIES CAN PULL THINGS DOWN, KNOCK THINGS OVER, ETC.  THIS WALKER IS VERY STURDY; MADE WELL.",5
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"Having three children I decided to go with the walker. We never used one before because it was never recommend by Dr's. This center is the best. It has stoppers so don't fear your little one can't move. Pull them out and you can push them from room to room with you with the handy holder in the back. The baby loves it and I think it's great. Also, Mom's who have taller babies this one lasts longer than the average bouncer;seems it adjusts higher than the others.",5
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"The Tot Wheels Activity Center is a good walker for the money.  The price we found to be very comparable to other walkers.  We really didn't notice any pros or cons to this particular walker over others.The main problem that we've run into with both of our daughters is the fact that that they really enjoyed the toys for about 1 month at the maximum.  After that they got bored and soon started fussing to get out and roll around on the floor.Our first daughter used the walker part of it for almost a week before again getting tired of it as the fact is, something along these lines is just too tough for a little one to control by themselves.  If you can imagine pushing a shopping cart that wants to go it's own way that's the way it is with the walker.  It's too big and bulky for them to easily steer not to mention the fact that little ones often don't realize what steering is.  The only know walk forward and crawl away when they can't move forward anymore.  With that said, understand that you'll have to walk with them to help them steer.Overall I remain convinced that a walker is good for kids to have so they have something other than their parent to hold onto to learn to walk but be prepared to help them walk in it because of the above mentioned bulkiness of the walker and the fact that I've never come across any walker from any company that's been easy enough for a little one to steer and push at the same time.5 stars for the idea and the toys but I had to take 1 star away for the difficulty to steer and another star for the limited time that my daughters used it.",3
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"My daughter loves this walker, and so do I.  I originally wasn't going to buy a walker because they're no longer recommended for safety reasons.  My husband's friend let us borrow one, so we tried it.  My daughter enjoyed being in it so much that we decided to buy her one for herself.  I chose the Tot Wheels because of its features.  My daughter loves the toy feature.  She often turns the steering wheel as she makes turns and she loves using the gear shifter because of the noises it makes.  I like that it's removeable and has a snack tray.  My house is mostly carpeted, so I only expected my daughter to be able to use it in our kitchen, like the one we borrowed.  Much to my surprise, my daughter was able to move around pretty easily on carpet.  I removed the rubber strips underneath so she can move easily from floor to carpet and vice versa.  My daughter is now able to use it all around the house.  I put out road blocks for areas I want to keep her out of, and our stairs are blocked by a gate.  It has even traveled with us to Grandma's house on many occasions.  It also serves as a high chair in a pinch.  While learning to walk, my daughter would push it by holding on to the spoiler.  My daughter is now 13 months and walking on her own, but she still likes to play with it.  It was definitely worth buying, even though I thought it was a bit pricey at first.",5
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"I have a six month old son (Patrick) and he is 95% in length (28 1/2 inches long).  There are a lot of walkers out there to choose from but because of his height they do not give him growing rooom.  I had seen and overlooked the &quot;Tots Wheel Activity Center&quot; because it wasn't portable. Besides the fact that it isn't portable, he already has an oversized entertainer (exersaucer), the Saftey 1st &quot;Bouncing Buggy&quot; which he loves.  Because he spends his time while I am working between his grandmother and his aunt I decided to get a walker that we could leave in the car to transport between the two.  Because he has been using the &quot;Bouncing Buggy&quot; I did not know that he was able to move around as well as he does until I started my search for a walker.  I liked the looks of the Chicco &quot;Taxi Walker&quot;, the Baby Trend &quot;Luv Jet&quot; as well as a few others; but, because he is tall these are not good for him.  At the heightest level his feet are flat on the floor when he is standing as well as sitting; besides the problem with the height, the seats are not as roomy as that of the &quot;Tots Wheels.&quot;  He looks as if he can step right out of them if he could.  There is no growth.  I am giving the rating of 4 stars because it has growth for him (up to 32 inches).  The sound effects are great as well.  Althoug the &quot;Tots Wheels&quot; doesn't collaspe as the traditional walker's do it can be disassembled from the base to make it more transportable.  There probably won't be any room in your trunk, but portable non the less.",4
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"I bought this for my daughter at 4 months, she liked it ok at the time but now she's five months and loves it.  She is more able to reach all the noise makers and if she could get the star off and eat the whole thing she would. It's so funny to watch her try and get that star in her mouth.  I do really recommend this toy.  I actually was going to buy a stationary entertainer because my two older children only had walkers 12 and 9 years ago, but I liked the tot wheels features and the fact that it is mobile also, of course anybody should know with common sense keep it away from stairs.",5
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"My daughter really loves this. She can get around pretty easily with it, which makes her really happy. She just loves being mobile. The toys on the top are great and keep her entertained. I have looked at other walkers that seem like they are made pretty cheap, but not this one. It seems very sturdy to me, worth the money.",5
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"Very safe, easy assembly, colorful, entertaining, we are happy with this product. I agree with other reviewers, it's not very portable, but I can't see why I would need to take it with me. The height adjustments are easily minipulated, as well as the stopper brakes. My son, 6.5mos, (born premature, so a little small for his age) is so proud of himself when he makes the sounds work. For those of you worried about the sounds being annoying, (I was) they are not bad at all. I'm getting the dishes done a lot easier now :0).",5
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"I did my research on a walker and decided on this one thankfully. The wheels move great. Very loose. If you get one and the wheels are tight, call Graco and have them replace it. It rolls well on carpet tile and pavement.I love the fact that it has the removeable noise making device with an ON/OFF switch. It takes 3 ""AA"" batteries. It can get dirty on the tray under the noise device too.My 4 mo. old son loves it. I love it. When I go to the gym, I throw it in the back of the truck. Then just take it out of the truck, put the boy in, and roll him right into the gym. He lets me run on the treadmill for an hour when he's in it. Very handy.",5
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"I like the Tot wheels activity center because it has wheels for a walker and stopers so the walker won't move.  Everytime I place my 6 month old daughter in it she is full of joy.  All smiles come across her face, as she makes it make noise.",5
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"Our 8-month old twin boys absolutely love this walker!  They've used it constantly since we bought one for them to try out.  They love being able to get around themselves without needing adult assistance.  They chase the dogs and us around the kitchen, family room, anywhere they can get the walker to go!  Unfortunately, our twins' pediatric occupational therapist says we should limit their use of this type of walker.  Apparently the way the seat positions them, it promotes toe-walking and makes it more difficult for babies to learn to walk properly.  This was confirmed by a friend who's 1-yr old nephew used this since he was 6-months old and now walks on his toes all the time.  We'll continue using it since the boys enjoy it so much, but we will be limiting the amount of time they stay in it.",4
Bell Classic Child Carrier,"I am at a loss to understand how anyone can give a positive review for this child carrier. It's not worth it even if someone gave it to your for free. There's no way a child can be comfortable in this. The first bike I tried it on, the carrier sat too close to the bike's seat. The ride was uncomfortable for both me and my son. I returned the bike and got another model in hopes that the carrier would be a better fit on it. Guess what? I couldn't even install the carrier on that bike. The instructions on the carrier say that it would fit most 26"" bikes. That's a lie. I ended up returning the bike and carrier.",1
Bell Classic Child Carrier,"I bought my bike at WalMart. NEXT Power X Suspension Men's 26"" bike.We then bought this child carrier at WalMart.The suspension bike's rear forms come in at a lower angle and spread further as you approach the rear of axle and are too thick to install with these brackets.So, we have had this in the garage forever.I'm sure with a little more hardware we could make it work, but that's not the point. We don't have time for that.",1
Bell Classic Child Carrier,"After having two kids and trying to get active again my husband and I came across this. We installed one on my husbands bike and another on mine. From the very first time we set the kids in there and took them for a ride it was great. they both ended up falling asleep while my husband and I got a bit of excercise and relaxation. However, my 3 year old is on the taller side and she could hit the tires with her feet. So, we had to stop using it. But, it was good while it lasted.",4
Bell Classic Child Carrier,"It does not work with all bikes!  There should be some way to know what bikes it fits, or what parts your bike needs to have for it to work, before you buy it.Also, not directly related to the seat, Fed Ex is horrible! They had put notes on our door without having buzzed us. 2 times I was home when they came and they didn't call up.",2
Bell Classic Child Carrier,"We bought this carrier on a trial basis just to see if our 11 month old son would enjoy the ride behind my husband and he loves it.  We didn't really want to spend top dollar on a nicer carrier until we determined if he would like it.  For the amount of riding we do (which isn't much), this suits us just fine. This product is fairly easy to install on a mountain bike and having a 5 point harness is great too.  Basic carrier that serves the basic purpose.",4
Bell Classic Child Carrier,"I bought this and returned it the same day.  It was so difficult to put together and the parts did not even fit correctly.  It is a piece of junk.  We returned it for a bike trailer and are much happier with it.  My daughter, 18 months old, loves the trailer.  It holds 2 children and has room for some books and stuffed animals.  Also, if you fall, the trailer does not tip over.  Your child could get hurt sitting in this cheap seat if you fell off the bike!!",1
Bell Classic Child Carrier,I work at a Bicycle shop and have also spoken w/ pediatricians.  Be careful when using any behind the bike carier.  Make sure you practice w/ a doll or weights before you ut your child in any carrier that goes behind the seat. They are dangerous and offer no protection to your child if your bike goes down.  Look into the trailers for behind your bike for max safety.,1

"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","Graco Pack 'n Play Playard in Bugs QuiltI had been shopping for Play Pens for sometime and nothing seem that appealing until I found this one. The extra size and the bright colors just did it for me. But what makes it even better is the ease with which you can put it up and take it  down. But the best part of all is how much my granddaughter enjoys this playard. She is fascinated with all of it. She enjoys playing with the different bugs (that make sounds when touched) which are on the inside as well as outside. She also loves to make faces in the mirror on the inside as well as just gaze at the bottom designs. I thought she wouldn't like being put in the playard but she fooled me as she seems to really enjoy her time in it.The bottom quilt has very pretty interesting designs. Children love the primary colors much more than the pastels that so many playards come in, and the designs of this playard are quite appealing to toddlers to view and play with.This playard is a real winner!",5

"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I agree with the other reviewers who give kudos to this playard for it's square shape. It's amazing what that extra few inches can do.We were lucky enough to be given this playard by a co-worker to leave at my parents' house for naps for our kids. I honestly had no idea what to expect, but when we opened it up, I was thrilled.My two-year-old wanted in right away and went to work playing with all the movable parts. She didn't want to get out of it!  Unfortunately she can now get out of it (at 28 months), so although it's still plenty big for her to nap in, we have to make sure she stays in it.It works great for our 7 month old and I see it being great for him for another year to year and a half.I have to admit that I haven't had much need to take it down and put it back up since it stays up at my parents' house, but from what I've heard from my mom, it's not hard to do either.The only drawback for me is the garish mix of primary colors. I honestly thought this was a hand-me-down from the 80s/90s when I saw it first. I would love to see it update it with some more modern colors, but that's just me.",4

Sometimes he goes over to it and looks in, then turns to me, asking me to put him inside so he can play.  He is very happy when he's playing there. It was easy to set up.  I haven't taken it down yet, but I think that will be easy, too.",5

"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","If you are searching for playpens for your baby, look no more.  Get this one!  This is the sweetest playpen ever!  My baby is only 3 months old and loves it even though she can't even ""play"" in it yet.  She just lays there and looks at all the bugs.  She even talks to them.  The colors are so bright and bugs are so cute!  My 10 year old can put this playpen up and take it down in a second.  It goes up and down so easily.  There is plenty of room for even a couple of babies to go to sleep in and it is very sturdy.  I expect to have no trouble reselling it after my baby is through with it too.  A used on on ebay sold for $5 less than I bought my new one for.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I got this playpen for my 8 month old now that she is everywhere. It has nice bright colors, toys on each side and a lot bigger square shaped then most playpens. I'm highly satisfied and it shipped in 2 days in great condition. &lt;3 Amazon.com",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",I HAD GOTTEN THIS PLAYPEN FOR MY GRANDSON. HE JUST LOVES IT. SOMETHING DIFFERENT ON THIS ARE THE SIDE WALLS THAT HAVE ENTERTAINMENT FOR HIM TO ENJOY. WHO EVER DESIGNED THIS; THIS IS BETTER THAN THE OLD FASHIONED PLAYPEN. I HAVE A HAPPY GRANDSON.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I have 8 month old twins and purchased this pack n play about a month ago.  My mother had an old square one and I loved it. The new rectangle ones couldn't hold both of my kids at the same time, but this one is perfect.  We use it in the kitchen while I am cooking and outside while I'm doing yard work.  They both fit in it comfortably with several toys, having plenty of room to roll and play, and they love the toys on the side.  My daughter talks to herself in the mirror all the time and my son just loves the interactive bug wings.  It is by far the best product I have purchased or recieved! I highly recommend!",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",I looked around for a full size play yard for my grandchild and did not find many; most are the smaller versions.  I bought this one and am very happy with the purchase.  It is very easy to take up and down and also very colorful.  My daughter was impressed because she had not seen a full size playpen like this in any of the stores.  I told her this is the size I had when she was a baby.  Thank you Amazon for stocking this item.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I loved this play pen, it is square and nice and roomy for my son to play in, he moves around easily and has great color schemes that are so eye catching. My son also likes to take his naps in this playpen, he is very comfortable in it and can stand easily. the extra toys built into the sides amuse him all the time and it is very easy to fold and un-fold for very easy transportation when we go on vacation and to take inside and outside. Love this playpen and my mother-in-law liked it so much she bought one for her home as well.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",I love the graco pack n' play playard colors.  I got it for my 5 months old son a month ago.  There are four different activities for him to play with and it is big enough for him to crawl around.  You do need to put a blanket at the bottom for him to lie down in the winter.  It is light enough to travel.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",I love this pack n play because its SOOOOOOOOOOO spacious.  My son loves the little bugs and can lay in it for a while (4 months old).  I think as he gets older he'll enjoy playing in it and I'll feel good because I know its a safe place for him to be.  Would recommend.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I'm the grandma and bought this for my daughter who has three children under 5.  The baby needed a safe haven to play.  Not a tiny pack n play!!!  Our generation couldn't live without the square, large playpen.  Now your generation doesn't have to!This is a super product.  Well made.  Large size.  Perfect for my grandson who is 10 months.  Plenty of room to play with toys.  Loves the toys on the sides also.Enjoy.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I purchased this playard b/c my little girl rolls a lot and the rectangular one she has kept her from being able to move around too much. She's able to move all over the place and play! We also took it on vacation and used it for a bed, no problems there either. She loves all the toys on each side of the playard and she's facinated by the colorful mat, as well. Great purchase, well worth the money!!!",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I researched what I wanted in the way of a fun playpen for when my grandchildren visit. This is the one I chose, easy up and easy down and easy to put away, plus being fun for them is an added bonus. Thanks!",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I searched and searched for a square playpen from the olden days.  Well this fit that criteria perfectly!  I hated to keep her confined to the new smaller pack-n-plays to play in.  To nap is one thing, but to use as a play yard at home is completely different.  She is currently 6 1/2 months old and will play for about 20-30 minutes on her own before her attention span is gone.  This allows me to prepare dinner, clean up a little, or even just sit on the couch and RELAX.  She may still be young, but she's on the move already.  This keeps her in one place, where I left her.It does slope to the middle, but she doesn't have a problem with that, even if I sit her down around the outside of the mat.  She only plays with the crinkly butterfly and hasn't taken the time to discover the other sides to play with.I would recommend this to anyone with a baby girl or boy!!!I (a woman) opened this up and set it up on my own the very first time within a few minutes. We have not taken it down or moved it since I set it up in the living room.  I specifically bought it as a playpen and not a travel pen.Overall, I am VERY pleased with this purchase and have bragged to other friends, that have babies similar age, that I have an Old School Style BIG playpen.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",It is a sturdy reusable bag that I take with me every time I go grocery shopping. It saves on getting all those plastic bags that you don't want and you can put a lot more in them too.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I was debating between this toy and the Joovy Room2 play yard which is slightly bigger. My baby is 6 months. In the end, I chose this one because of the built in toys on the sides. Assembly was a breeze! Just one or two steps and you're done! No foul or strange odors (like some people noted with the Joovy). The mat is firm yet soft enough for a baby to fall on without injury. Sure enough, my baby loves it--everything from the images on the mat, to the toys attached on each side. Right now he's interacting with the bumblebee side and yelling at it as he tries to pull it off. This is a safe way to let my baby play with toys without worrying about him falling on top of them.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",I was so pleased to find a ""real"" playpen for my granddaughter. It has lots of space for playing and sleeping.The decorations on both the sides and the bottom of the play yard are bright and cheerful.The ones attatched to the sides either crinkle or squeak. One has a mirror. It is very easy to set up and can be stored easily. I would highly reccomend this item.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",just right.  keeps the little one happy & safe & in one place.  My daughter especially loves the toys built into the sides.  The only minus is that it is a bit heavy to move around.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","My 4 month old son was already over the weight limit for pack and play bassinet inserts, so I wanted a pack and play without that added piece.  This product is great.  I took it on our first overnight trip to my mother's house, and our son fell asleep in it immediately.  While he isn't a good sleeper, by the third night he seemed to feel comfortable in it at night.  On another trip to visit family, we set him up in it and he slept well for his naps.  It sets up really easily, and I like the bright colors.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","My friend had bought this pack and play and when my son and I went to visit for a play date I was amazed at how content he was playing in the playpen. I quickly went online to buy one for my home and he is in there now as I am online. I have more free time to do dishes and sweep and do laundry, all while I watch him of course. It has the mirror which he loves to look at and giggle, the butterfly wings he likes to teethe on, simply put money well spent! I am completely satisfied with my purchase and would tell every mom to invest in one!!!!",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","Ok, I know I may sound as a Gracco shareholder here :-) but really this was the BEST purchase I made for my son.I bought it in January 2012 when he was 6 months and I have waited until April to write this review because I wanted to have a good idea of the product.My son is now 10 months and he still loves it!He spends a lot of time there, I put a lot of his toys inside (soft ones to avoid him falling on the hard ones and getting hurt), and he stays there playing with them, playing with the decoration of the play yard, really enjoying his time.The size is bigger than the ones we usually see around, which is a big plus in my opinion.When he first started going there he could not be standing on this feet, but over the time he learned to stand and hold himself in the play yard and sit by himself again. Now he walks around the play yard holding on it. It's really good exercise for his legs.I found it's very helpful to leave him there while I am cooking or doing things around the house, I have him always under my eyes while he is there, but I know he is safe and having a good time.The only bad comment I would make is that the base of the play yard is really hard, unconfortable I would say. I know Gracco does not recomend but I put some interlockinf Foam mats under the cute mat that comes with the play yard. This was very helpful because at the begining my son would try to stand and fall a lot, without the extra mat I think it would be hurtful.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",Opens and closes easy and my 6 month old daughter wants to sit inside of it.  This is a great playard and love the rattles and mirrors inside.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",So excited to get this for our baby....had another Graco pack n play but it took up too much space. Love the colorful toys and mat...baby loves exploring!,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",The glo-worm was a baby shower gift...it plays music for just the right amount of time to keep baby's attention....,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","The GRACO pack and play works well for us plus it doubles as a crib when needed. If gives you peace of mind when you have to leave the room for a short period of time, to know the baby is contained in a safe place.",4
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",The Pack N Play works well when my grandchild comes to visit.  He loves the bug toys and the bright colors.  I can take it anywhere. I am very satisfied with my purchase.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","The playpen is a sizable unit for one that wraps up so neatly.  Its colorful quilt lining and 3-D attachments to the mesh siding are a real plus.  It would do for a nap-time bed while providing more play space than the usual port-a-crib.  The unit takes up about the same amount of space when packed, so no need for two units where one will do.  Save the space for all the other paraphernalia.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","The size is good, easy to use! We bought this as a downstairs solution for our crawling daughter to hang in while I make dinner. The size is good (rectangular) and it is easy to just fold up and put in a coat closet.I am happy with it, just wish I would have bought it before 9 1/2 months! She now just wants to get out of it!",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",the toys on the sides are getting a workout and Christobal is having fun under the sun as well as in the house. This is a great change to the older models as the floor foldes into the cube it stores in a lot nicer to travel with than the old folding plywood sheets. and when folded up it makes a great barrier that he knows not to cross in the hall.....again thanks to the ability to get productes that are not avaible in local markets at fair prices....Perry and Cindy,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","This is a classic!  Buy it!  Nothing else like it anywhere!The best.  Timeless.  Safe, baby likes.  Mom and Dad can eat, shower, cook, Baby has room to play and stay in safe place.  Mobile to take with.  Best investment.  Worth every cent.  Had one 23 years ago, and bought again in 2008. Doesn't that say it right there!",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","This is a great pack and play!! It is a good ""old fashion"" playpen--lots of room for baby and toys. Very bright colors, cute ""play stations"" on each side-- a sun that is a mirror, a bee that rattles, etc.  Very, very easy to setup and break down. Great value. Would highly recommend.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","This is a great product very comfortable for my 9 month old, but the carseat is a bit big and cumbersome.  It fits in my car just fine but you definitely don't want to be taking it in and out of the car.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","This is a really nice playpen for babies. It is bigger than a average playpen, more square, and has little toys inside built to the playpen for them to touch and play with. Takes up a little more space than usual if used inside, but still good for outside also. My baby and my son that was 18 months fit in there together fine. i give this a 5 star rating.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",This is for our baby girl. She isn't using it yet but I have set it up.  It's so much more compact then the one I had as a baby.  Easy to fold like a regular port-a-crib but larger. I bought some fleec to make a fitted sheet for the bottom. That is the only draw back. There is no fitted sheet that matches to order. It is wipeable though. I know this will come in handy until she learns to scale the sides and escape.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",This is not a portable product in the way you think of portable.  It is sturdy and the bonus is it packs into a carry bag.  Folds up or out in seconds and is as sturdy as a non-portable.  very large compared to what they sell in the stores about twice the size but not too big to be a hazard.  What would I change about this product? NOTHING  It even has toys on each of the sides for children.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","This playpen is amazing. I bought it for my niece's 4 month old baby.  The baby was attracted to all the bright colors.  She found the firefly wings and started mushing them.  She is still too tiny to see herself in the mirror, but when she starts sitting up she will be mesmerized.  I ordered the playpen on a Tuesday and by Friday it arrived.  I am very satisfied with the product and the whole purchase experience.  Thank you!",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","this play pen is great.  it is sooooo easy to pick up, transport, put up and put away.  we have used this at the park, tailgating for football games, and as a bed when we went out of town.  my daughter actually learned to take her first steps in this pen.  highly recommended.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","This playpen is great my granddaughter loves it.  We take it camping with us,and use it at home.  It goes up and down easily and stores easily.  This is a very good playpen.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","This play yard is extremely easy to set up quickly. Compared to another I've tried to set up, this one beats it by at least 10 minutes, plus it doesn't exhaust me doing so. Each side snaps up and there is a mechanism to push when releasing. The mechanism on this play yard is easier on my ""older"" fingers and I can do it easily.Taking this on a trip would be great because the whole thing wraps up so compactly and fits into a zipper bag. Taking this outside during the summer months will be a breeze!My 6 month old grandson loves scooting around in this and the colorful images attract him from side to side.Overall a well thought-out item. I've been pleased with everything about this play yard.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","This portable playpen does what it's supposed to do.  It came ready to go out of the box (just needed to put in the bottom pad the baby sits on). The directions were good - not fantastic, but good, which is better than a lot of other products can say.  We had a prior model of this product, and it worked very well.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",This product is everything it claims!....Keeps my Baby happy and ""busy"".Would recommend this for new parents that need a little break now and then and they will know their babyis safe and secure using this.  Lots of room and well built. easy to set up and take back down.  carrying bag could be a little better...but all in all a great item!,4
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",This was the frst time our son had been in a playpen. With in minutes he was playing with the ""attached"" toys. In short he loves it. It's perfect to keep him entertained while cooking dinner or taking a shower. It assembles quickly and stores neatly and easily in the included storage bag. We are considering buying another to keep at his grandparents. We would highly recommend the Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","Very spacious and my 6 mo old loves it. She rolls around all over the place and plays with every object. It's brightly colored, easy to assemble and clean. I feel she is safe and has lots of room to play without getting bored too quickly while I get things done.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","Wallyworld had this at the same price, but they were out of stock. The shipping was free, but I still didn't have to wait very long for it to arrive. This one is probably the biggest ""playpen"" any one can find. My son loves it! It's big enough for him to roll around in.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","We bought this based on customer reviews. Thus far we like it very much and so does the little one. The size is just right. Not too big, but big enough to last a little longer than other similar products. Colors are nice. The four toys are great, especially if you are a cleanliness freak, like I am, because you can play with the baby touching the toys on the ""dirty"" outside of the crib. There are only 4 toys but each is perfect.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","We bought this when my son was only a few months old.  He's now 11 months and we get a fair amount of use out of it as a playpen.  It's a roomy place to put your child when you need to keep them ""contained.""  He's loves to cruise around in it and smack the built-in rattle bug.  It's not great for sleeping, though.  Because of all the fun little critters on the four sides, it can be a bit noisy.  It folds up fast and set-up is a breeze, so I give it 4 stars for that.  It is a little on the heavy side at around 30 lbs., and not the ideal portable crib.  With all the stuff parents already have to lug around for their babies, I think that one of the smaller pack n plays would be better, which is why we are getting one of those, too.  This one is fabulous as a fixed playpen or for trips in the car.  If you're flying, buy something smaller.",4
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","Wonderful,beautiful playpen!!""Hard to find"" square size is perfect & roomy for baby to play in!!! Very colorful & well made!!Would definitely recommend!!!!",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",I had a hard time finding a play pen for my Grand daughter. There are many Pack N Play items but I wanted a larger square playpen like they made years ago. This one was exactly what I wanted. She has room to roll around and play with toys and it's easy to set up and take down.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","This is a great for play.  I really like the built-in toys and bright colors.However, I bought it for our vacation as a place to play and sleep.  Unfortunately, the pad is somewhat uncomfortable and the sheets (must be purchased from company other than Graco) cause the pad to be a little lumpy.  My daughter would also wake up and want to play with the toys in the middle of the night and then had a hard time going back to sleep.Although I love the size of it, it is quite awkward to move around when open since it is heavy and large.Still worthy of 4 stars since it does what is says it will do.  I am happy with it.",4
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",This is the best playpen around.  The colors are great & the  attached designs are like no other.  I purchased it when baby was 3 months old  He is 9 months now & still enjoys being in it. We have a 2 story house so this is kept in the family room. for naps & play time when we can't provide 100% attention.  The attachments are very entertaining.  It is bigger than the average playard but not too big. It comes with a nice bag so we just pack it up when we are traveling.  We just love Graco!!,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I would have given this product 2 1/2 stars. It serves it purpose, but took some time for my baby to get used to. I wish I bought a plain play yard. My baby started playing in it at 5 mo. old. At first she was overstimulated with all the bugs and kept reaching for the antlers. This frustrated her when she couldn't reach it. She is now 10 months old and is no longer frustrated, but she still puts the antlers in her mouth. The material covering the antlers on the bottom is slowly coming off and it could possibly be a choking hazard. We cover up the bugs with antlers with a blanket. The mirror and ladybug was not not a problem. I called Graco when I received this product, and they assued me all materials were safe, but I still worry about the bugs with antlers.I would pass on this product and get the Joovy. Just place 3 toys in it for play time.",2
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I bought this after reading the overwhelmingly positive review on this product...My daughter was about 7-month old when it arrived and she appeared to like it the first time we put her in it. She spent about 2 minutes in it and then wanted out.after that we tried a few times but each time she wouldn't spend more than 1 minute in it. If we kept entertaining her from outside the playyard (like play peekaboo), maybe she would be willing to stay as long as 3 minutes in it.now she's 18 month old, she only spent a total of about 20 minutes in it (after about 10 tries). we gave it away as a gift to a friend.i gave it 2-star because I do feel that it's a well-made product. just be aware not all kids like this. :) it seems most do though based on the review here... not sure why my daughter doesn't (as she likes most of the toys that received good review here)---------------add on 4/30/2013my daughter is now almost 5 and i have a son that is ~9 month old. though my daughter never likes this playpen, my son is OK with it. he can spend many minutes in it as long as there is an adult around, and if there are enough toys in it. i think the fact my daughter does not like it has a lot with the fact that her grandma leaving her around the time when we brought this playpen to her and she might have some negative association with it... so i modify my review to 3-star.",3
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","Really the best product for the kid . Soft and hard enough at the same time. WOnderful colors, great toys ...Love it till every little bit of it.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I was able to pull this out of the box and put it together and less than a minute. It is very colorful and the toys are very cute. I have a 3 month old that is a little to small to play with them, but she like to lay in there and look around at the toys and the colors. The bottom pad is cushioned but not very much. I think it is soft enough for naps and play time though. My 8 month old played in there last night and scooted his bottom around in there and played with the toys for about an hour. This is a larger playpen that would be hard to move from room to room. IT is 3 feet by 3 feet w/ no wheels on the bottom. I have it set up in the corner of the living room where I will keep it. There is noting about this that I do not like. My only change would be to have a cover that was washable for the bottom, but luckily I do not have a baby that spits up.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I like this pack n play. The only problem I have is that the middle kind of sinks in so unless your baby is a highly experienced sitter, it is tough for them to balance b/c it's slanted in towards the center. But the colors are pleasing and I didn't know this but the animals/sun embroidered on all 4 sides have little attachements that the baby can play with when their in the pack n play. That was a nice little surprise. My daugter loves the little wings on the bee b/c they have little rattles in them and they make noise when she hits them.",4

"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","why do I love this play pan?  Very simple:1. Great quality material; sturdy and safe2. Large with lots of space (my grandson crawls around).  Can fit two kids!3. Very easy to assemble!3. Very colorful!  Bright beautiful colors.  My grandson looks at it and want to jump from my arms inside of the pan.4. The colorful patches around it are toys!The toys are:a) A beautiful butterfly with wings that when squeezed it make a dried plastic sound (he loves it)b) A lady bug that makes sounds alsoc) A sun with a mirror (safe for babies)d) A bee with playful wings, which also makes soundsI strongly recommend this play pan!  My daughter has another one, not Graco, that is half of the size.  It is nice but not eye catching like this one.It is worth every single penny!",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","Love the playpen but it is smaller than described--36 x 36, not 38 x 38.",4
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",I have used this pack 'n play with three grandchildren ... almost 5 years and the quality has yet to be compromised.  This is one of the smartest purchases I have made.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","the pen is perfect and bigger than the pack n plays with the bassinets.  i wanted something to keep my baby safe in while i was busy cooking or doing dishes.  he can safely play in this and the toys stitched onto the side mesh keep him occupied even if his toys dont.  the only downside is its hard to find playsheets locally.  you have to source them on amazon.  other than that, its a great playpen!",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","This thing is HUGE! I dont know what I was expecting, but after looking at a big box store at smaller ones we chose this.  I put it up alone in 30 seconds and it swallowed our livingroom!  It seems to really entertain our 5 mo old tho, she really likes to look at the bugs around the sides and rattles and squeeker keep her pretty entertained.  We haven't had an accident in it yet so no info on the cleaning issue, I made a sheet for it with a waterproof lining and hope that will help.  Its easy to scoot around the room to keep it out of the way even tho in the box it seemed pretty heavy.  We haven't traveled w/ it or moved it around much so no issues w/ broken parts. So far we're happy! UPDATE 12/21/10: Took this on a weeks long vacation home, held up well to being heaved in and out of our van several times, was great to keep her wrangled, entertained and to sleep in.  No issues w/ broken parts etc, the bugs wings on the sides are even holding up to her pulling herself up w/ them. Still loving this one n w/ our girl already 27"" tall n crawling its plenty of room for her to move around, play and stretch out for a nap.",4
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I love this spacious play yard.  It gives my little one lots of room to move about.  Perfect to keep her contained while we're outside and I don't have to worry about her eating the grass or anything else she shouldn't be.  While pregnant, I didn't think this was something that we needed; I was wrong.  I would recommend getting some sheets, although that takes away from the cheeriness, you will want a way to wash the mat.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",I bought this last summer for my two year old when traveling. He had outgrown his regular pack and play. I was looking for something larger but still had the sides. I found this on Amazon and decided to give it a try. I love this bed. It does take up some room but it was amazing when we were traveling. I did put down dome padding because the mat isn't that comfortable however I would definitely recommend.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",Bought this for grandchildren's visits seven years ago.  Now being used by our church nursery.  My daughter liked it so much we recently bought another one for her home.  Good quality and construction.  I like the full size space that allows a toddler to play safely while a parent has to direct their attention elsewhere.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",I rated this product 5 stars because of the ease of setting up and the baby loves all the items on the netted sides.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","My grandmother purchased this playpen about a year ago to keep at her house so that whenever myself or my sister came over with our kids, they would have a safe place to play. My son is now approaching 2yrs old and still loves to get in it and play with his toys. The large design means there is room in there for more than just him.(Toys too)-The other play-yards do not have much room in them at all. -He loves the all of toys attached to the sides. I love the fact that he can see out on all sides and I can see in. (He can also see to watch T.V. with his big sis while safely confined.)I like this playpen so much I have added it to my baby registry for our new baby. (Although, I have been begging her for a year, my grandmother won't give hers up!)I have another playpen made by Graco. One of the new fashion, smaller rectangular ones. It's been collecting dust in my garage since my son was 3 mo old.The only thing the rectangular play-yards are better for are trips,where you usually have a limited amount of space, and for the bassinet feature that this one does not have and most of the others do.(I've learned to just call hotels and make sure that they provide a crib.) This playpen does fold down to the same size as the others and it does include a traveling bag.A bassinet feature added to this playpen would make it perfect because it is a little deep to try and gently place a smaller infant down in. ( That is where a bassinet feature is really nice.) To tell you the truth though, they out grow that feature so fast that the benifits of this play-yard really out weigh that loss.It takes up a little more room than most of the other play-yards out there, but the room it gives your infant or toddler is well worth the loss of space.All in all it's larger old fashioned square design is the best! If I don't recieve one of these myself, as soon as the new baby arrives, I'm stealing grandma's!",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",Be very careful using this play pen. My baby loves playing without shoes or socks on. He was plaing in the play pen wiggling his legs against the walls of the play pen. Apparently the walls in the play pen are made from a very rough netting and scrubbed the skin off my babies toes. At first I couldn't understand why he had blood on his toes but then we noticed blood lines on the white netting. From now on he is only allowed to play inside when his shoes are on.,1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","The playpen is large and spacious,perfect for babies to roll around and play in. My only gripe is if the baby were to puke on the mat there's no way to wash the entire thing, just spot clean.  To solve this problem one has to buy a covering/sheet to cover the playpen surface.  Sheets are hard to find, and expensive to purchase and ship. But on a positive note the playpen is sturdy and easy to assemble.",4
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",I love the size of this product and basically everything about it except its heavy. Other than that its great!!!!!,4
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","Nice & big , bright beautiful colors, fun interactive toys attached to the sides like a butterfly that when the baby hits it or kicks with his feet, make a noise. There is a mirror whIch he loves. Unfolds very easily but my husband and I seem to have a little trouble folding up but I think it is us not the play pen. This is for our grandson when he is visiting and when we babysit. Our grandson is 8 months old & weighs about 21 lbs & there is plenty of room for him to roll around in. We sit him up in there and if he falls over, the padding is thick enough that he doesn't get hurt.Great purchase and came, by the way, the next day after I ordered! Can't ask for better than that.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",I bought this for my 18-month-old. She has always had the freedom to wander around the house but sometimes I need a brief nap or a shower and I prefer to keep her safe in this. She doesn't really care for it because she's used to the freedom and has spent a total of 10 minutes in there. We're expecting baby #2 and I plan to use it right away to get the baby used to it. Hopefully it wasn't a waste of money.,3
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","What a great playpen!!!  With 8 children, we have had a few to compare it to.  This one is wonderful.  It sets up just like the standard Pack N Plays, which I find very easy.  We've had a standard rectangular Pack N Play for several babies. That is the one we take when travelling, and I wanted one I could just leave set up someplace in the house. This one, straight from the box, was put up in about 30 seconds by my 14 year old.  It is so bright and colorful and FUN.  My newborn isn't too interested in that part yet, but my 2 year old didn't want to come out, when I put her in to explore it.  They will probably both be using it. The bottom padded part is very nice, thicker than the other Pack N Play, bright and colorful, and I think will sponge off if needed. The toys on the side are really cute.  My choice of this particular one was made because of the rating of use from birth to 3 years old (some of the others were only rated to 1 or 2 years), as well as how fun and colorful it looked, and its bigger size.  The rectangular Pack N Plays are fine for napping or sleeping, but once the baby gets bigger, they are a bit cramped for playing.  This one will be just perfect, as baby grows, for what I want it for.....playing in a safe, fun, stimulating environment when I or a sibling can't be right there.The only negative, which wouldn't deter me at all, is the carrying bag is a bit &quot;cheaper&quot; looking/feeling than the other Pack N Play that we have.  I don't plan on toting this one, so for me, that isn't an issue, but it might be to someone.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","Our family loves this product! We used it from infancy to over age one year. It was very easy to set up and assemble the first time. Directions very easy to follow and took only minutes to assemble. It has very easy to clean fabric. Just wipe it down. Baby loved the toys on each side of the play pen and also the colorful block pattern on the mat. The size and height of this product is just perfect. Large play area inside. This product has held up to alot of use for over a year and still looks new! It came with a reusable bag to store it in and make for easy carry in car. Also, we found no safety issues w/this product. I did alot of research before choosing this product and this one meets our high standards. I highly recommend it.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","It is the best play yard you can find. Very sturdy, colourful.. My baby loves it. He can see me while playing and he is happy about that. The best option!",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","We ordered this play yard for our daughter's 4 month-birthday.The order came in with Standard Free Super-Saver Shipping within one week.The play yard is very easy to assemble,attractive colors,great quality,comprehensive instructions,WONDERFUL designs on all four walls (including an unbreakable mirror),steady colorful and easy-to clean floor mat.What else could one dream of?We are 100% satisfied with this purcahse.Highly recommend!!!!",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",LOVE this pack n play!! It is very large compared to standard pack n plays and the bright colors are refreshing rather than the normal drab colors.  There are toys built into the mesh walls which provide easy entertainment.  It's very easy to put up and take down.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I bought this for my daughter's visit with her 11 month old son.  She never liked the idea of penning in her child but I think it is necessary at times to limit his mobility (emergencies if nothing else).  He immediately took to this, fascinated by the butterflies and other attached colorful parts and even used the support to start to walk sideways on his still unsure and wobbly sweet legs.  Great Product!  My daughter enjoyed sitting in the sun and reading in the mornings while her son had fun outside in the playpen in the shade close to her. Quickly assembled and easily packed away in it's compact case for their next visit.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I am very thankful I chose this particular pack-n-play. I've seen the ones my friends have for their babies and I definitely got the best one!!! It also folds up easily and stores nicely. It is a little heavy, but they all are to me. It is sturdy and I think it will last. Sheets that fit this particular model are pricey, though, as it's not the average rectangular shape. Other than that, it is perfect! My daughter loves it and so do I!",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",This is the best playpen on the market right now.It is much bigger than the pack-n-plays so bigger babies aren't crowded.The colors are stimulating and happy.The built in toys are also fun.Like a pack-n-play; this playpen comes with a pack for easy portability and I think it may actually weigh less.You can also order extra mats if needed.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",Like this pack 'n play very colorful and love the different sounds and textures of the bugs on the play pen.  Very portable.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I read all the reviews on the pack and plays and found that the reviews on this one were all great. I do not have a child but I watch my nephew very frequently (every other weekend). I wanted something that could be both a place to sleep and a place to play. With its bright colors and toys built in my nephews face turned to smiles. He is so comfortable that when he is done playing and tired he will put his head down to sleep. He loves the rattle butterfly and the crinkle butterfly. He plays with the toys on the pack n play more then the toys in the pack in play. Set up was a breeze. Before buying this pack n play we borrowed my brothers. What a pain to put together and take apart. Sometimes all the sides did not lock and you had to start all over. And take down, you prayed before you start that all the pieces snap apart and it will take you less then 20 minutes. With this pack n play it takes a minute, parts snap and unsnap quickly it is the true pack n play. The bag is a little cheaply made then other bags I've seen but fits perfectly. The padding on the bottom of the pack n play is thicker then others I have seen. It is larger then other pack n plays so you will have a hard time finding bedding and sheets that fit it properly.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",it is sturdy...colorful and safe...just a little too heavy...will probably need help to fold it up for storage/moving...nice carrying case/cover...,4
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","This is a nice sized pack and play with something on each side to occupy babies.  Nowadays, its really hard to find something big enough to accommodate more than one baby and this does.  It's east to put together and take apart.  Really glad we bought it !",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","After shopping around for a play yard, my husband and I found that this is by far the largest one we've come across. Also, the bright colors and little built-in mirror, squeeky, crinkle and rattle toys are great. It provides a good place for baby to both play and sleep! I would definitely recommend it.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",This is large enough for a bigger baby which is why I bought it.  My daughter is long so it was perfect. I haven't had her in here during the day but I'm sure she'll love the cartoons printed.  I bought it as a second bed for when she's at her grandma's knowing that she'll be able to fit in it for a while.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","Bought this for my granddaughter - she loves it.  The playpen is a lot of fun, the baby is secure and can be transported from one room to another easily.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I love this play yard. It is so colorful and when I first placed my son in it he loved to look around at the bright colors; then he  liked to play with the butterfly and bug.  He is now 9 months old and giggles &amp; stares at himself in the mirror.  I am so glad he likes it!All of my friends registered and got pack&amp;plays that are narrow and have great features like changing trays etc. I thought I would miss that but I don't. The bottom is cushy and he sleeps in there fine. We all took our kids on vacation and my play yard buttoned up perfectly. It is just as compact and portable. The only difference was that my friend's pack &amp; plays were not as large when set up. This is more like a PLAY PEN.  The pack &amp; plays are narrow. A drawback is that you can NOT put a pack&amp;play sheet on this b/c this play yard is square, while the others are rectangular.  It doesn't matter to me...I put a regular sheet in and tuck it under the whole mat.I really am glad I chose this one. It is colorful, has things to look at and play with, and it is soft and comfortable...this equals great playtime AND sleeptime.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","If you're like me you may have gone back and forth between this Graco and the Delta (Novel) playard. I ended up buying them both for my twins and here is the comparison.Ease of setup--they both take about a minute to put up. The graco was slightly easier to push the middle down that pops it all I to place.Weight & sturdiness--the graco feels lighter than the Delta (a good 5 lbs+), but the Delta feels a bit sturdier when set up, and seems slightly more durable.Shape--the graco is very squared off, and the Delta is square on bottom but curves inward as it goes up so the top railings are in a more round shape. This feels like its saving some space even though the dimensions are the same.Mattress--the graco has a very bright, colorful mattress pad with squares and bugs on it. It has a decent thickness in terms of padding for the baby to be comfortable. The pad also lays flat, but you do get a slight dip in the middle after a baby has been in there for a while. The Delta has a colorful mattress pad but with 'gentler' tones of color featuring the animals on the mesh sides. The padding is not as thick feeling as the graco, but the pad itself is more water and stain proof of a material than the graco. Even though it's not as padded feeling it feels sturdier. No dip in the middle, and I would feel a bit more comfortable with more weight in the Delta.Mesh---they both seem to have equally durable mesh. The graco has built in toys on each side of the mesh; whereas the Delta has the animals printed on the mesh.Price--the graco is more expensive than the Delta.All in all they are both nice. I think the better one depends on what you are planning on using it for. If it's going to be up all the time at your house or daycare, etc. I think the Delta is built sturdier and will be more durable with continued daily use. If you are using it to bring around with you places (hotel, camping, on the back deck, grandma's, etc). then I would go for the Graco because it is much lighter to lug around, and has built in toys so if you forget to bring some there is still toys for baby to play with. The graco also seems sturdy and durable; the Delta just seems a bit better in those departments; that's all.The 3ft by 3ft size is amazing!!  Wish I had bought one sooner!  We have twins and they both can play in one together without them feeling like they are on top of each other.",4
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",I have seen many Pack 'N Plays but this one is adorable and most functional. It has so much color that any baby wouldlove it. It is easy to put up and take down so a real added plus as we only use it about once a week. Very pleased.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I actually called up Graco to ask if the hard surface on the bottom was safe for a toddler to bump his head against as he's trying to walk & move around.  They seemed to think it was perfectly fine, but I don't feel good about leaving him unattended.  They should either have a more cushioned mat that comes with the pack & play or at least sell one that's optional.",3
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",My son comes to work with me and I keep him in here when he's active - sleepy. I've had it now for almost a year. What a great buy.,4
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I bought this product because I was looking for something a bit larger than the traditional rectangular play pens. I was looking for a safe place where my daughter could play without feeling claustrophobic or contained. This one worked like a charm! She is happy and I am happy! This playpen has easy set-up so you can fold it and take it over to grandma's at anytime :)It's fun, easy to carry, and most importantly easy to clean. The only precaution I have to give is that it is rather large and WILL take up a large chunk of your living room so be prepared to give up some space.",3
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","Loved this pack and play.  Still have it and use it when guests bring their babies.  Easy to assemble and take down, and has a nice large square area to play in.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","We bought this for our daughter after she was born. It worked great for short periods of time, when you need to do chores, or put things in and out of the oven, you know the kind of things you don't want your little one crawling into. It also folds and packs into the carry along very nicely, so it's easy to take with you and with a little extra padding from folded blankets, it makes an excellent place for nap time when your out for the day with your child. It's proven to be durable enough to survive my little spartan, and is still in use as a hand me down with my niece. This thing has seen two years of constant use so far and aside from some stains, it looks like it can survive another child. For me, it has been well worth the money and the product is very durable, and I've recommended it to friends and family.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I love this product but I wish it comes with a padded mattress which I could not get one that would fit.  I always put a folded comforter underneath so my grandson would not feel the bump in the middle. It's also a shame that I had to cover the pretty prints on the covered pad with a soft blanket because the texture is so rough.  Otherwise, my grandson loves the toys and the mirror that came with it.",3
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","This was one of the bigger play yards I saw and the price is great.  My daughter starting noticing the &#34;toys&#34; on the side when she was about 7 months.  One side has a rattle sound, one side the butterfly wings that come out, etc.  My daughter loves playing with all the sides.So far it seems easy to clean.  I would recommend.  Glad I didn't spend the extra money on the more expensive play yards.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","We received this playpen as a gift for our daughter who is now 11 months old. We started putting her in it when she was 9 months and still use it...at Grandma's for sleeping, in the kitchen when she doesn't want to be in the highchair, outside to get some yard work done....we put toys in and she has played in it for up to 2 hours!! I even got presents wrapped and cookies baked while she was in it! It has been a wonderful addition to our arsenal and she plays alot with the attached toys, as well. Highly recommended! Everyone told us she'd HATE a playpen and cry the whole time..she LOVES being in it.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I just purchased this pack 'n play based on the reviews I read.  I was very impressed how easy it set up right out of the box and thought for sure I'd never get it to fold back down right.  It certainly proved me wrong and is very easy to fold back up for storage/travel.  I like that it's bigger than most other playards and my son can use it a year longer.  I have to admit I'm not wild about the colors....but it's all about what my son enjoys, not my preference of decor. I still give it a 5 star rating!",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I have now owned this play yard for a few months and it truly was a great purchase. It has to be said its rather large which is exactly what I was looking for, but If the space you are planning to use it in is rather small I'd check the specs first.It takes to my 2 children's wear and tear well, I have a 2 year old and a 10 month old and both jump in it all day and scratch it, beat on it...try to chew on it at times and I have to say its holding up really well, no damage thus far, looks as good as the day I bought it. Very sturdy yet comfortable enough to nap in.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I ordered this because my 23 lb 30 inch long 7 month old hates his pack and play and I thought maybe if I ordered something bigger he would sleep better on vacation. A lot of reviews say that the mattress on the bottom is thicker than a standard pack and play mattress..its not, in fact its worse than our standard pack and play. It had an odd odor to it when I unpacked it, and looked as if someone else had used it before. When I decided to return it back to amazon(which was immediately)  I noticed that someone else had already returned this item, How did I notice? Because the shipping label was still on the box from the previous owner. Luckily amazon has an awesome return policy..",1
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",I bought this for my granddaughter and another one for second child  well made hours of fun easy to use and love primary colors and designs on it  entertaining,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I registered for this pack n play solely on the wonderful amazon reviews that I read. I wanted something larger for my baby to play in, and the Graco TotBloc definitely delivers.  That being said, this pack n play stinks as a napping or travel crib.  It's large, bulky, the foam bottom is thin and not very comfy for baby to sleep on, and there is no mattress option for a pack n play this size!  I took this on a trip last weekend and put the baby in there with a blanket on the bottom so she wasn't uncomfortable. Every time she rolled around, it would make the rattle toy attached to the walls of the pack n play move. It actually woke her up, and it was a long night. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone wanting this to double as a napping crib.If I had to do it all over again, I would have gone with the Joovy like I originally planned.",3
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","baby likes the wall elements with the built-in sun mirror/reflection, the crinkle wings on the butterfly, the baby rattle bee wings...the fabric walls made this comfy for baby to lean against. the floor is hard and not much padding at all. good size. soft, protected angles. I wish it was easier to collapse the sides -- haven't figured that out yet....",4
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I bought this item because I had seen it being used for my nephews and niece. I loved the colors and the activities on it.  Most play pens are drab and very cramped compared to this one.  It is square instead of the usual rectangular ones and seems roomier somehow. On each of the 4 sides there is a different toy, sun/mirror, crinkly wings on butterfly, beeping press toy in the beetle. Its also great to sleep in when traveling. My sister's twins slept in it together when they were 4 months old and visiting us.",4
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I have purchased two of these.  One for my house and one for grandson's house.  My grandson, 7 months old, loves the colors and plays really great in this play yard.  Plenty of room!  Keeps him safe if I am not within arms reach.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","This was the only playpen we could find that was large enough to use for twins.  We have used this for our babies ever since they came home from the hospital as preemies.  We leave it set up in our kitchen.  Now that they are 5 months old, they love all the bright colors and interactive toys (mirror, rattling things.)  I also put them in it for naps during the day.  It is also great for tummy time.  I have taken out the bottom mat and placed it on the hardwood floor so we can play together.  Another great feature is that it packs up nicely for travel.  I'm very glad we made the purchase.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","This thing is roomy, sturdy, fun and colorful. My kids both love it. The only issue is my personal concern about the polyurethane foam in the floor of it, which is treated with flame retardants. Having a small babe or toddler mouth toys on the padding (the treated foam is covered with fairly thin polyester), eating on,  and crawling all over it is just not something I am comfortable with. I solved this problem by purchasing a BabeSafe cover for the floor (size F fit well. Do NOT order size C, because this is a bigger play yard than the standard Pack n Play). Now it's all good and we are super happy, but those extra $40 I had to shell out to protect my kids from flame retardants took 2 stars off the product. In short, I would really recommend this product, but only if a proper offgassing cover is purchased.",3
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I bought this play yard to put my 8 month old in when I need to keep her contained and safe while I am cooking. It is perfect. The size is ideal as she is able to roll and move around it and play with her toys but does not take up all of the room in our small living area. The pad seems comfy and she will be able to nap in it. The toys on the sides are great, she loves to play with the butterfly. I am very happy with this product.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",This is absolutely a great product. It is big compare to other pack and play and the reason being why we purchased it. We did put two cushions for a softer flat form. You will need two person to open this so the lever will adjust at the same time.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","Forget the pack 'n play if you already have a crib.  This playpen gives the baby plenty of room and it's bright and colorful and easy to store when not in use.  My daughter and son-in-law have medium sized dogs and this playpen offers a space for the baby to play where she will not constantly be licked by the dogs and she and her toys are safely out of reach.  Her play yard fits nicely inside and she can lay on her back and enjoy it without being on the floor.  As she grows it will be a secure play area when mommy and daddy can't always be at her side, but they will still be able to watch her.  She loves the bright colors!  Highly recommend it!",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","This play pen is the most used baby item we own. My two kids have used this over the past 3.5 years and it is in excellent condition.

Safe, fun, will not collapse and fall down, etc. And&#8230;no little guy (9-14 months is hurling themselves out of this thing) From what I understand a lot of kids climb out of others that are shorter.Believe me, I'm done looking at this eye sore, but can say from experience that it will keep your little lady/guy safe and occupied and will stay with them a little while longer. **you do have to buy some cute secure hanging light up fun things when they are little for the sides. Besides that, I can't actually believe I'm buying the same thing 6 years later.  Worth it. My first Amazon review, btw.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","The product is ok but Graco should reconsider make the carrying bag of a better quality as the first flight the bag and the interior were DAMAGED, the bag should ""survive"" at least one flight.",3

I purchased this one because it was the biggest one I could find. Not only does she play in it often with plenty of room, we use it as a portable crib. She falls right to sleep in it and sleeps very comfortable. We have had it for 6+ months now and it has gone from TX to CA and back and is holding up great.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",I am very satisfied with this pack-n-play.  It is larger than a traditional pack-n-play and it has very cute activities on all 4 sides.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I love this playpen! I did a lot of research trying to find a square playpen with lots of room for my baby girl to play in. It has a toy on each side of the playpen for baby to play with (a mirror, butterfly with wings that rattle, etc. When I first got this for my daughter, she was 4 mos. old and she would hold on to the wings of the butterfly to pull up and stand. She's almost a year old now and she still loves to play in this. Also the pad of the playpen has colorful bugs on it and she loves to lay down and look at them. It has room for her to brush up on her walking skills - she'll walk around the inside of the playpen, round and round. Everyone that comes over our house wishes they had one for their baby. We have been very pleased with this playpen and would recommend it to anybody!",5

The large size is great, it is simple to set-up and fold-up.  It is very sturdy and off the floor and the sides are entertaining as each has an activity (squeak, crinkle, mirror and rattle) and the bright colors are very appealing.  I was able to put a mobile on this Pack N Play at the corner.  We just love it and will be able to use it both in the house and in the yard.",5

"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","This is a great, roomy play yard. I bought this because it was the closest one I could find to the play pen that I had for my babies.  It gives them plenty of room to crawl around and spread out in.  It's easy to setup (a little heavy to haul around though). Bright colors and cute bug pictures & toys make this attractive to babies(and adults). I'm a little concerned about keeping the fabric cover on the pad clean.  It would be better if it was removable so it could be washed instead of just being able to wipe it down or spot clean it.",4

It the perfect thing to keep her amused for anywhere from 20minutes to an hour! It means I can go to the bathroom in peace and get some chores done knowing she is safe and amused.It is super easy to put together - it literally takes less than a minute - take out of the box - unfold it and it clicks into place. The pictures on the side are of good quality and my daughter likes to pull and play with them.We also have a weekend home - so bought two of these. I would guess this could also double as a crib for the weekend house - ie - for a night or two at a time.Highly recommend for the 7 - 10 month phase of baby's development.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",The baby loves this and it's easy to set up and move around. Much better then having her on the floor.,4
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I bought this playpen for my 6 month old grandchild. He is just learning to crawl and stand up on his own in his crib and is about 29&#34; tall. I was worried about being able to put the playpen together, but it was as simple as could be - much easier than the Joovy I tried before. I pulled it out of the box myself. You pull the sides up, then push the center down. The mat has four snaps that must go through a slit and snap on the underside. That was a little tricky, but I managed it alone. For reference, I am 5' tall. You have to lean over to push the tab through and then grab it on the underside. With care, it will stay in there while you lift it up to do the snapping. It probably took me no more than five minutes to set it up.I have only had it a short while but baby has tried it out and seems to love it. There was plenty of room to scatter toys around. He particularly enjoyed the crinkly butterfly on the side. He did try to pull himself up on the bee that rattled so a child who is new to standing might have to be watched to make sure this doesn't tear away from the mesh. The ladybug is a little hard to press for an infant, but that is probably good because the sound is pretty loud and I think at this age it would scare him more than entertain him. For an older child, it would be fine.Note that although the playpen is 38&#34; square, the mat is 36&#34; square so if purchasing a mat cover, you should get one 36&#34;. The playpen sits about 6 1/2&#34; off the ground. There are no wheels on the &#34;feet&#34; but they are plastic. The whole thing is fairly lightweight and easily moved around. It's approx. 23&#34; from mat to top. Baby at 29&#34; was tall enough to chew on the cloth top. :-)  I am guessing the mat is about a half inch thick. It will make for a soft landing should baby fall over unexpectedly.Cleanup is supposed to be easy. I haven't had to do that yet so I can't verify. The mat itself doesn't appear to be removable but I have purchased a cover which can be slipped on and off and washed. Description says to just clean with soap and water.I'm really pleased with this colorful playpen and I think baby would give it a thumbs up too.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",Great product!  Has fun shapes inside and foods up super easygoing transport.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I bought this play yard for my daughter to use at daycare. At home I have a basic Graco play yard without any decorations. My daughter instantly preferred this one over the plain one. She actually watches it in wonder from across the room. You can't help but take her over to it and let her play for a while because she loves it so much.The colorful decorations and toys are definitely great at keeping her busy. It folds up and transports easily. It is easily cleaned with a damp soapy cloth and if all else fails you can buy a replacement bag and/or mat affordably ($16 - $21 each). I love this play yard and recommend it highly to anyone looking for a roomy, stimulating environment to keep his or her young one in.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I bought three of these 1 for my  granddaughter, and 2 for my daycare, I just love it . It is so bright and the kids just love the toy that are on the sides , it keeps them happy.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","Hard to find the right areas to open and close. Maybe if instructions were better written, I could find the areas better",4
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",This playpen is a great safe place for the baby to play if you need to put her down for a minute. Also works well as a bed if your traveling and very easy to set up. I'm very happy with the purchase.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",Loved this Pack n Play. It held up very well for years and our little one seemed to enjoy her time in it.,5
Portable Crib Mattress,"i love this very much. my baby is not due untill agust 11th,2006.  i could not find this item anywhere in a regular store untill someone told me about babies r us.com thanks again i can hardly wait for my little one to be born.and it fit right in with my budget.",5
Portable Crib Mattress,"This portable mattress fits perfectly in my Eddie Bauer Manchester Print travel yard(dimensions are 24x38 on both) and is slightly thicker(1/2 inch more) than the other portable crib mattresses that I've seen.Also, this one is waterproof and lightweight. It can be used in both the bassinet and crib portion of the aforementioned travel yard.MUCH better than using just the hard pad that comes with the travel yard.I should add that this also fits graco's pack and play portable crib sheets... which are the sheets I use in my Eddie Bauer travel yard.Seems to be fairly hardy in construction. Should last at least a year or two of regular use. If not.. well, buy another one. They're only $20.00! Regular moms(don't know about day cares) wouldn't need this any longer than that year or so anyway.",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I bought this pump mainly because were always out and about.  I am actually a stay at home mom but this came in handy in MANY ways.  When my daughter was first born she was re-admitted to the hospital at 3 days for jaundice.  I had read that breat milk can increase or worsen jaundice so I pumped to save the milk for when she got out of the hospital.  The ice packs were definatly a plus and so was the cooler bag.  I had frozen just the bag to keep it cooler along with the ice packs and that really helped keep it colder longer.  The bottles that comes with it are ok.  I don't recommend Avent bottles for feeding but for storage they're perfect.  But if you prefer Avent you can just pop a nipple on the bottle and wha-la, ready to feed.  These bottles can go from pump, to fridge/freezer, to warmer, to bottle with not problem.As for the pump, once you get used to assembling it its a breeze.  It's also VERY comfortable to use with or without the &quot;petals&quot;.  I NEVER had a problem with not pumping (or producing) enough milk.  This also came in handy and quickly reduced engorgement for me.  All I had to do was pump for about 5  min on each side and it was instant relief and baby latched on better.I highly recommend this pump for everyone.  It's comfortable, efficient, whisper quiet, and easy to clean and put together.  A must have.",4
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"This set is a good deal because you get the bag, bottles, pump, ice packs, etc. all in one. The pump is easy to clean and can be stored in the bag which is a nice touch. My daughter likes the nipples and there are a variety of proucts that go with this Avent line.I have had this set for 6 months. My daughter is breastfeed 99% of the time but on occation she takes a bottle if I'm out. I have used the pump to store some milk in the freezer for emergencies. Using this pump is time consuming and a little tough at first. It sometimes doesn't get a great suction and doesn't cause a good letdown. If you are a breastfeeding mom who is only going to use this pump on occation it is a good choice. If you are going to be doing a lot of pumping I wouldn't suggest that this is the one to get. Something electric is a much better way to go.",3
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,I love this breastpump! I just had my first baby and I use the pump on a daily basis. It is so easy to use and very comfortable. (and the price is right!) I definitely recommend this one to all the moms out there.,5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,I am a mom of 2. I didn't breastfeed my first but I am with my second. I bought this pump because I am a full time college student. So far I have only used this once at school (have time to come home and nurse between classes) and I have used it at home and at the in-laws. I have come acustomed to the leaking...its not that much just enough to get a bit wet. So to solve that everytime I pump I grab a papertowel and hold it under the suction cup to catch the leak. And for the suctioning...you have to be sitting in the right position for the suction to stay. And if you press the pump too hard on your breast the suction will get harder. Don't pump when you are hurting and engorged...try to pump before that happens. I would recommend this pump to anyone but inform them of how it worked with me. Not one pump will work 100% to your liking. You just have to adjust.,4
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I registered for this pump for #1: the price  #2: I had only planned on breastfeeding during my six week maternity leave so didn't see need for an electric.Well, I ended up continuing to breastfeed, and this pump has sustained my supply and kept my baby EXCLUSIVELY on breast milk. I work full time and am able to pump 3 four oz bottles while at work. Each takes 3-5 min, so bathroom trips are quick and pumping sessions discreet. No one ever realizes I am pumping in there.My daughter is 5 1/2 mo now and still exclusively on breast milk and I plan on continuing to nurse for many months to come. Pumping is not a big production with Isis. It's convenient and simple to clean- no hoses etc. It is as little of a hassle as I can imagine and that is so important to me as a working mom of a breastfed baby.",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I have 2 of these pumps and they are fantastic.  I find it to be easy and efficient to use...and I've been using it for over a year.  It is THE BEST hand pump on the market.  I ALSO have a Medela Pump N Style double electric pump...but I must say that the Avent Isis works just as well.  I alternate between the two types of pumps depending on my schedule.  I keep my Pump In Style at work...as it is faster to pump both sides at once...but I use the Avent Isis at home and on weekends...or if I am going to be away from the office for business travel, tradeshows, or off site meetings.  It is compact and small and easy to pack for the day or a trip, etc.  It is comfortable...you have a lot of control over the suction...and I can express just as much milk with this hand pump as I can with my electric pump.All of the Avent products are fantastic. I can't recommend them more highly.  My biggest advice to anyone looking into breast pumps is NOT to buy ANYTHING sold by formula manufacturers...they do not care if you are successful breastfeeding.  Avent and Medela products are wonderful.  This is the absolute best pump for the money.  My friend Christine used hers for over a year while working...it was the only pump she had...and she did great with it.",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I had to use the Medela Electric Pump from the Hospital for 10 days. At first it didn't work well because my milk had not yet come in. I tried using the Avent Isis pump that I had previously bought, but it  didn't work. Then before returning it I tried putting it back together again, and it not only worked, but works better and faster than the Medela electric pump. It's faster, quieter and more efficient than the electric pump (for me at least).The travel set with the bottles and the insulated carry on bag work really well. I would give this product five stars, but I have to agree with one of the reviews that it's a little tricky to get the suction to work. A matter of habit I suppose.",4
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I purchased this product because I was going back to work and  I heard so many good things about Avent. I love the pump, but the rest of the package stinks. Number one, the ice packs are never frozen.  I placed the packs in the freezer over night and they were cold, but not frozen. I took the packs to work and placed them in the freezer. Same thing!By the time I got home the milk I pumped at work was lukewarm the packs didn't remain cold(and yes, I placed the breastmilk in the fridge at work). The insulated bag doesn't work well with the Avent ice packs it came with.  I would recommend the pump, but I don't recommend buying the whole set. I used mine for a week and then switched to a $5.00 Baby Innovations cooler bag and $3.00 Especially for Baby Reusable Ice Packs. They stay frozen for several hours. My breast milk was cold to the touch at the end of the day. I would buy the plain thirty dollar Avent pump and buy a cheap cooler and ice packs separately. You'll save about 15 dollars if you do it that way.",3
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"Nice pump, will recommend to all moms. However it makes a funny sound when I pump and it is loud - I wish it was more quiet.",4
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"My baby was in the NICU right after birth for 5 days and I needed to pump exclusively to get my milk established.  They provided me with a deluxe electric double pump which worked well.  I was told my supply couldn't be established/maintained with my manual pump at home, so I went home with a hospital rental while my baby stayed in the hospital.  When it was time for him to come home, I contemplated whether or not to keep renting the electric pump; I had received this ISIS pump as a shower gift and I thought I'd try it before deciding what to do.  Well, I was shocked how well this pump worked.  It is so comfortable to use and doesn't tire your hand pumping.  In the same time it took me to double pump (15 minutes) I got the same amount of milk using the manual one breast at a time!  I ended up returning the electric pump and didn't at all feel uneasy about maintaining milk supply.  This pump works as well, if not better than the electric pump and costs so much less!!  This is my 4th child, I've tried other manual pumps as well as battery operated ones in the past, but none compare to this pump.  My only qualm about this system is that the nipple rings and nipples for feeding are substantially bigger than the standard nipples/size for bottles, so you are committed to using only their brand with their bottles (the bottles are nicely shaped and easy to hold).  My baby had a hard time breast feeding, so we had to bottle feed for a while and he couldn't get the hang of their bottle nipple so I had to pour off my milk into another type of bottle system to feed him.",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"As a new first time mom, I had no idea what I was shopping for when it came to breast pumps.  I started out using an electronic Medela pump in the hospital and continued pumping at home with the Medela pump in style.  I love the Medela pump and thought nothing could come close to it, especially a manual pump.  I thought wrong.  The Avent Isis works just as well.  Its great for occasional use, a little tiring for frequent use, but nonetheless is just as effective.  The product description rings true for me, I can pump just as much milk with the Avent Isis in roughly the same amount of time as the Medela pump in style.  The pump is easy to assemble, you just have to be sure that you assemble it correctly or else it won't work properly (poor suction).  Since its a manual pump, you control the suction and speed and can vary it to match your baby's sucking pattern.  I still use the Medela Pump In Style when I'm at home, but when I'm on the go, I use my Avent Isis and love it.  A useful sidenote:  Avent also makes a conversion kit which I use with my Medela pump, so I can still pump directly into the Avent bottles and VIA containters.  I highly recommend this and all other Avent products and hope my review was useful in your quest for the right pump.",4
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I got this pump because I was tired of hand expressing whenever I needed to leave my baby for a short time.This pump is a godsend .Being that I never used a electric I cant compare the two,however I do know this pump is very comfortable &amp; expresses milk quickly .I can get 4-9 oz out of one breast in  3-7 minutes.I express milk daily &amp; store it for later use.The silicone petals produce a letdown as if my baby were nursing.The kit itself is very handy for travel.I keep a small bottle of hand sanitizer in my kit.Just the other day I was pumping in a dressing room while shopping.It is very discreet.You just have to purchase two extra gel packs to keep the milk cool, but most hospitals give them away with thier going home kit,so needless to say I didn't have to purchase anything extra.",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I bought this pump after reading all the rave reviews. I wanted a pump for very limited, occasional use, that was compatible with all the AVENT bottles I already had, and that was not too expensive since after all, I wasn't sure if I'd even be successful at breastfeeding. THIS WAS A MISTAKE! True - the pump does work when your supply is fully in. It is also quite comfortable, and discrete. However, it is hand operated, obviously, and this means that it will take much more time and effort to pump a bottle than with the electric. Time and effort are in short supply with a newborn. Frankly, when you breastfeed you spend enough time strapped to the couch with the baby that a pump needs to be comfortable, quick, and easy. Breastfeeding has enough challenges, pumping need not be another. Bottom line - if you want to breastfeed successfully, you absolutely need an electric pump (recommend Medella). My advice is to rent one from the hospital for a week while you give breastfeeding a try (or just hold off on buying one right away), and if you decide you want to continue nursing after a week or two, then invest in the $200 Medela electric pump. (Purchase online through somewhere like momsmaternity.com for much less than at this, and most, stores.)  Spending $50 on a manual pump is honestly a waste of money. I can't tell you how many of my nursing friends tried to warn me about this, and I didn't want to accept that I'd really need a $200 electric pump. I just didn't think I was a ""gung ho"" nurser, and after all, isn't that what those pumps are for? Well, I have now been nursing successfully for 5 weeks. It has had many challenges, but I do believe it is worth it. However, an electric pump is essential for (1) relieving engorgement, (2) making a bottle so someone else can feed your baby while you're away (even just to go get your hair done, or go run errands - away doesn't necessarily mean on an extended business trip), and (3) building up a supply of frozen breastmilk for unexpected absences (believe me they happen). Happy nursing, and don't waste the $50.",3
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I have a wonderful electric pump, but I truly like the Isis better.  It is more comfortable, because of the cushion.  It is so portable.  I live in MD and often travel to NY and CT to see family, and its wonderful on the road.  It's more convenient, it gives you more mobility- you aren't stuck to an outlet, etc like with an electric pump.  And it works almost as quickly as a dual pumping electric.  And, since I am a pumping only mom (my baby had jaundice and was irreversibly nipple confused at day 5), I use it 6-8 times a day currently. I absolutely love this pump.",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"Before I bought this pump, I read lots of reviews about manual, battery, and electric, single and double pumps. Since I only plan on having one child, I did not want to invest in a[n expensive] pump to use for a few months.When I returned to work my son was 3 1/2 months old, and I only planned on breastfeeding until 6 months. I used this pump in the morning (while he nursed on one side), once during the day at work, and during his night feeding. I was able to keep up with his daily regimen with ease.I was a little scared to try it for the first time since a lot of reviews said pumps in general were painful. This did mimic my sons sucking action, and was not bad. If you can get through the first week of breastfeeding (a different kind of feeling that no one can prepare you for), you can pump on a regular basis without problems.I like the how easy this pumps is to take with you. The carrying case is attractive, and looks like a regular lunch bag.",4
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I based my decision to purchase this pump based on all the reviews it got.  However, it takes me about 20 minutes to pump 4 ounces.. on a good day!! Luckily, I have an awesome boss, who allows me all the time I need to pump.. I average 2-3 ounces every hour and half.. at 20 minutes at a time.. which is rediculous. If I could, I would purchase an electric pump, because as my baby grows, I don't see how I'd be able to catch up to her growing appetite using this pump, and not spend my whole day in the bathroom pumping.  On the plus side.. all the litle extras it came with are great, and the case is discreet and keeps the bottles cold for a few hours.",2
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"When I registered at Babies R Us, I wasn't sure what pump to choose.  I asked the ladies at my breast feeding class what they thought and I got many reccommendations for the Medela and Avent Isis pumps.  When I found out that the Medela (electric) pump costs $250, I was worried.  That was more than my travel system!  So, I decided that I would register for the Avent Isis and if the pump was too slow, I would then look into buying or renting an electric pump.  I WAS SO PLEASED!!!!  The pump only costs $60.  It only took me 20 mins to pump a 9oz bottle... and it didn't hurt a bit!  Best of all, I can EXPRESS BREAST MILK ANYWHERE.  There's no need for an electric outlet, no batteries to replace, and it's almost silent.  My daughter is now six months old and I'm still nursing at home and using the Avent Isis at work.  The Avent Isis is the only breast pump I will ever use and I reccommend it to anyone.  Who needs one of those expensive, noisy electric pumps?!",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I can not believe that this tiny little, battery free pump is so wonderful.  I have a 10 month old and I've used this pump so much more than my big expensive Pump In Style.  I love pulling the Avent out of the cupboard and pumping one side while I feed my son the other (yeah! Milk for later!) or stealth-like going to work and having no one know that my little black black case inside my bag is a pump.  I even think my Isis works better than my big pump.  I can control the pressure with my hand, there's no hoses, power cords or strange noises ""Errr-hoo, Err-hoo, Err-hoo"" to mess with.  I must say, it took me a few tries to really get the Isis down.  I wasn't sure how much pressure to use.  But, after a couple learning sessions, it's been such a joy.  It's incredibly comfortable & productive.  Yeah Avent!  Thank you!",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I used this pump for occasional use.  I worked one day a week, and pumped once a day when I was home.  This pump lost suction, and the pump itself cracked after about 6 or 7 months of use.  I found that it did not provide enough suction even when it was working well, and that the parts were too delicate (and I did not ever put them in the dishwasher).  I have found that Avent products in general do not stand up to long term, repeated use.  I was never able to get more than 3 ounces per session of pumping, and it would've never sustained my milk supply had I been working full time.  I am due with my second child in 2 months, and will definitely be buying the Medela Pump in Style this time around (and I should've listened to my other mom friends with the first baby).  Their Medela pumps stood up to multiple pumping sessions a day for a year or so and will probably last them through their second children, too.",2
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,Worked wonderful &amp; was very happy with it until the neck of the pump cracked.  It is useless now.The bottles &amp; nipples are wonderful.  My baby took to them instantly.My other children used platex nursers &amp; they did not take to those as well as these bottles.As for the pump though i was very very disappointed.  Spend the $60.00 on just their bottles instead of the pump kit.,2
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"My sister-in-law bought me this pump for Christmas. It's been great. It's never hurt to use it, I get a lot of milk fairly quick, and when you get the sterilizer too, its easy to keep clean and ready to use. Nothing is better than having a good pump on hand when you are engorged and baby is sleeping. :)))",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I bought the Avent on the go pump, after having difficulty with the electric pump(not a hospital grade pump)that I already had, because I am having surgery in May and I need to pump for while I am in the hospital. I found the Avent to be MUCH more comfortable than the electric one.  It is also very easy to express milk.  I did find that it works better for me without the massage petal attachment. (I get 4-6 ounces at a time.) I didn't get enough suction with the petal attachment on.  I am a stay at home mom so I only pump once a day.  I am not sure how it would be for a working mom but, it works great for what I need.  If you only need to pump once in a while or even once a day to get a stock up in the freezer I recommend this pump.",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I had been using this pump for a couple months. It worked pretty well - I have a fast let-down so I could get a few ounces in only a few minutes. However, it was very squeaky and would keep my husband up at night while I was pumping. Also it was not very ergonomical and pretty messy. (The way it's put together, milk collects under the rubber shield and drips out the bottom.) We also had problems with the bottles leaking. There are a lot of parts to clean too.The last straw was when I was cleaning it, and putting it back together, one of the rubber seals wouldn't fit back on correctly. It didn't come with ANY directions for cleaning, assembly, or disassembly so I couldn't tell what I'd done wrong. And apparently, you can't get any spare parts for it. So I decided to try a different pump.Thank goodness I did!! I bought the Medela Harmony manual pump and it is 1000% times better! It's quieter, came with very clear and thorough directions, is more comfortable, works just as well, and has far fewer parts! Definitely go with the Medela if you're looking for a hand pump!",2
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I loved this pump. I had my first child this past year and I wanted to breast feed but I was a little bit leery. My daughter wasn't latching on correctly and I was ready to give up breast feeding. Instead I always pumped and feed her with a bottle. So we both won. This pump was awesome and inexpensive. I took it everywhere to work, realitives houses, the car. The bag is discreet ( it almost looks like a purse). It only took me like 5 mins to pump and cleaning it was easy. I would recommend this pump to anyone.",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I researched and the avent pump got great online reviews, but I found it to be frustrating, time consuming and with mimimal gentle use, it finally broke. It is hard to get and keep a good suction. This was very frustrating. There are a lot of parts and it needs to be taken apart and washed after every use, so in a rush...well, don't be in a rush because you will immediately be dissatisfied.  Not to mention, trying to remember what part goes where, and the parts are hard plastic and break easily. Avent must know this since they include a few extra pieces in the on the go kit, but they didn't include the piece that broke on mine. This didn't even happen with frequent use.  I used my pump 10-20 times over the course of 7 months before it was finally too broken to use at all. My recommendation is not to buy this product, go with a medela.  I had to purchase a second pump and I am much happier with it.",1
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I received this breastpump as a shower gift with my first child.  The only thing I got out of it was a lot of aggravation.  The pump would not stay together long enough to get a good suction on the breast. With my second child, I believe I'll try another brand.",1
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"This is the best breast pump I have tried.  It is totally comfortable and so affordable.  I was using a Medela electric pump, (which I rented the actual pump and spent the $105 to get the pieces to it).  I decided to buy the Gerber pump, oh my, thought my nipple was coming off.  The Medela hand pump made my nipples bleed.  The electric wasn't so bad but the expense was more that I could afford.  A friend was so thrilled with her Isis that she bought me one.  She new I had been having problems producing milk and this was a miracle.  I saw so many lactation specialist that weren't so much help.  When I got this breast pump it was very easy to use.  I produced much more milk and was able to breast feed without sore breasts.  It isn't suppose to be a painful experience it is suppose to be a bonding experience.  (Bonding with the baby not the pump)  I felt like a cow hooked up to the electric pump all of the time and this pump is so small and discreet you can take it anywhere, plus the breast milk flows out so easily with this it takes no time to finish.  The best part is it is so quiet you can pump in the restroom and no one is any wiser.  We all know the breast feeding is best but if you are having problems I recommend this pump.  It is so much more natural and helps you produce more milk for the baby. I know that the Avent people are great and whatever problems you have with the product they will replace it no questions asked.  The pump disassembles easily and is no problem to wash and sanitize.  This kit comes with everything you will need plus more.  I love the fact that the bottles are interchangable to sippy cups and my little girl was off her bottle at 10 months!",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I am very pleased with this pump! After reading all of the reviews I decided to pick this one and I am glad I did. I have never used one before and it does take some getting used to at first and a little awkward, but I think using any pump would be. Once I got the hang of it (which didn't take long), I have really enjoyed using it. It was also a little intimidating with all the parts and peices there are but just read all the instructions before using it and before you know it, it becomes second nature taking it apart, washing it and putting it back together. I use it in the mornings when I am really full (I've noticed that if you use it when you are really full it goes alot faster) and it takes about 20 minutes to get about 4-5oz. But my daughter is now 21/2 months old so my supply has increased. When I first started pumping I would get about 2oz in that time, which was fine cause thats all she needed at a feeding. I really like the fact that you can pump right into the bottle, store the bottle, and then heat it put on a nipple and use the bottle. Its very convenient. I am a stay at home mom, but I am very glad that I got this particular set because its easy to transport the bottles and keep them cool. Also if I do need to pump while I am out it also comes in handy. Plus nobody knows what it is, its a very nice bag and looks just like a purse. I would highly reccommend this set to anyone(even if you don't work), it comes in really handy and as I said before easy to use and very effective.",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I can pump just as efficiently with this pump as I can with my Medela!  Very discreet to use at work, very easy to transport anywhere, easy to clean, easy to use with my Avent bottles.  Great product!  Oh - also - very comfortable to use.",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"For small-busted women, or women with lowish supply this is definitely not the answer. Especially if you are going back to work full time.  The Avent bottles however are amazing and incredibly durable.",3
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I had bought an electric pump after I had my son (who is now 3) because I thought it would be faster and more effective-IT WAS AWFUL!!! It hurt, I could never get the suction right and it barely expressed any milk. So I bought the Isis pump because it was relatively inexpensive and I LOVE IT! It was fast, extremely comfortable and pumped a full 8oz in under 1/2 an hour.  I am pregnant with my second child and I am buying a second pump (not just because my insurance company is paying for it), but because I want to make sure I always have a clean and sterilized pump.",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"This pump works wonderfully!  Although it was a little difficult to figure out how to use it at first, once I got the hang of it, I can now pump more manually on one breast than I can with my double electric pump on both breasts!  It is also way more gentle than my electric pump, too.  I highly recommend this pump!  Well worth the money.",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I bought this product because of the great reviews that it received. Overall I was very happy with this pump. It is lightweight and easy to transport.Since I am a stay-at-home mom, I didn't need to pump everyday, so this worked well for me when I needed to pump for an evening out. After seven months, I didn't need to pump anymore because my son could go longer between feedings, so I am glad that I didn't spend more money on another pump. Plus this pump has held up very well and should last me through another couple of babies.I liked that you can pump directly into the avent bottles, screw on the caps and store in the freezer. The overall system is very easy. It was also easy to clean this in the sink or dishwasher. Just make sure that you have the items secured in a basket because otherwise the pieces can fall down and can be damaged by the high temps of the dishwasher. Also, because some of the pieces are small and light colored, they can easily fall into the garbage disposal as well. This happened to me, but thankfully Avent supplies doubles for some of the smaller pieces and you can always order replacement parts if you need to.  I do think that Avent should consider making some of the clear parts tinted so that they are easier to keep track of.The reason that I gave it only four stars is that there were times when pumping was slightly uncomfortable, but if you work with this pump you find ways to get a comfortable pumping fit. I'm sure that it has a lot to do with the individual.Had I been a working mom or had a medical emergency which required a lot of consistent pumping, I think that I would have preferred an electric pump. I have a friend who is a stay-at-home mom of three who still swears by her electric pump because of the pure ease.This pack is great for stay-at-home moms who primarily breast-feed because it provides most of the bottles you will need as well as the pump itself. The directions are easy to follow and after the first few times of assembly, you will have it down. The carrying case makes storage easy and you can use it later for snacks or as a lunch bag.I say go for the quality of Avent if will be doing a moderate amount of pumping!",4
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I hate this pump. I dread pumping, but spent so much money, I don't want to go spend more.  It is far from gentle, the *comfort* pad hurts, and it is ineffective.  I am constantly having to pull my breast out and reset as it either backs up, or it stops pumping.  Once I hit a certain amount in the bottle, it won't even pull more milk out of me-- even if I still have plenty.A friend recommeded it, but both I and another friend can't figure out why.  She has even more problems with it because she is smaller figured.The only two things that it has going for it are 1) it is easier to pump with one hand than another I have tried, and 2) you can assemble it with one hand if you have a screaming baby and you are engorged to the point where the baby can't even latch on.  Other than that, it is worthless.",1
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"When my son was born almost two years ago I used a medela electric pump for the first 2 months.  It was loud, and painful.  It took me about 10 min per side to get 8 oz on each side.  I heard a friend talk about her avent pump and I went out and got one.  I loved it.  I was able to pump the same amount of milk as before but in half the time.  It was lightweight and quiet so I could use it anywhere and people did not know I was pumping.  My second child is due in about 3 months and I plan to use this pump from the start.  I recommend it to all my friends who are planning to breastfeed.",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"My cousin gave me her Medela Pump in Style which is a wonderful pump and I use it when I am home.  The Isis Back-To-Work Pump is ideal for on the go situations.  It is easy to carry to and from work, the pieces are easy to clean and assemble quickly, and it is very easy to use.  I thought a manual pump would be a big pain and would be very irritating to use.  Not this pump.  I can also express as much milk in pretty much the same amount of time that I can with the double electric pump.  The other nice thing is that I really like the Avent bottles which can be pumped directly into.  If I only had one pump it would be this one.  I was very skeptical at first because I heard from many mothers that in order to be successful at pumping you must have an electric pump.  I think this pump is just as good and 1/4 of the cost.",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,I bought this pump after a few friends raved about it.  I never found it to be helpful and wonder if I'd have been successful with bf if I hadnt' rented a hospital grade pump.  I now use the Pump in Style and it works great.  Don't waste your money on this pump.  I love the Avent bottles and nipples though.,2
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"Since I was going back to work when my daughter was only 6 weeks, I bought a Medela electric pump because I thought it would pump more milk in a shorter amount of time.  When I got it home, it was so loud that I didn't want to take it to work.  So I bought this pump specifically for work and now I don't ever use my electric one!  This one pumps a lot of milk out and it takes about the same time (for me) as the electric one.  And I use it almost every day with no problem.  Also it comes with everything you need to store the milk including the bottles (which are the only ones my newborn will take!).  And you can take it with you everywhere easily.  I recommend this pump to everyone I know whether you will be pumping occasionally or every day.  Best pump on the market!",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I have had a lot of difficulty getting any suction with this product - it often takes ten minutes or so, with a lot of taking the pump apart and putting it back together before I finally do.  Once suction is achieved, it works well.",3
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,I brought this pump because I wanted something easy to use so i could give my baby breastmilk while i was at work. While i was home for the first three months it work great and i really like it but then it started to leak and broke apart. I fixed it and used it a couple of times after that. When i went back to work and it took about 20-30 minutes to pump and my wrist hurt when i was finished. I then decided to buy the Medela which i love i went from taking 20-30 to get 4oz to 10-15 minutes getting 9-10 ozs. Its a great pump if you plan on using it only a few times but if your working it a waste of money.,2
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I am baffled by the enthusiastic praise by the working moms for this pump. I bought this pump first as I was leary about forking over alot of money for a good electric pump. I found this to be difficult at best. It was very time consuming for me to get more than a few ounces of milk pumped out. I had a difficult night early on with engorgement and tried to pump to relieve pressure, but due to the lack of sleep that accompanies new mothers I was unable to assemble the thing correctly and get it working. I was in tears with frustration. The next day I went out and purchase the Pump in Style and I haven't looked back. What a relief to be able to pump both sides at the same time with little effort and time involved. There's no way I could have continued to nurse for 8 months if I'd stuck with the Avent pump. I do however, highly recommend the Avent bottles. They are the only ones we used and my son was able to go back and forth between the breast and the bottle with no problem.",2
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"...So today I bought the ISIS...and brought it home, the assembly kind of confused me at first (Which really it shouldn't but I am worn out from having a 3 year old and a new baby lol) and I thought it might not be put together right but it actually was and I got the hang of the pumping after about the 2nd try to figure it out. The milk started to flow and I was able to empty both breasts in about 10-15 mins. It was absolutely wonderful! They were SO full and so painful and now they are soft and I can actually BREASTFEED my daughter since they aren't so huge and sore. The pump is wonderful though, absolutely NO pain at all unless you push on the pump too hard and it can't get stuck because once you release the handle, it's designed to release the pressure. It is so painless that I actually find it easier to pump than to feed her! It's also great for storing milk to  for late night feedings as opposed to sitting there trying to wake up enough to breastfeed. I love this pump, it was worth EVERY penny!",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I find this pump is handy and convenient, easy to clean, easy to stow and easy to use.  It doesn't take too long to pump.  I do however notice that I need to break the suction and ""re-latch"" a few times during each pumping session in order to keep working.  I don't know if this is common for all pumps or not-I've only tried this one.",4
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"As a first time mom, I was nervous about the whole pumping idea.  I read the reviews on this pump and decided to purchase it before the birth of my son, which was a good thing because I got the last one!  The first time I tried to pump I was scared it would hurt (after all the horror stories people were telling me)to my surprise it did not hurt at all, I was amazed at how quickly I was done and the ease of clean up.  My son quickly adjusted to the avent nipple/bottles and loves eating with his daddy. He is thriving on both the breast and bottle with no nipple confusion.(we started at 5 weeks)I love this pump. It is discreet and easy to use on the go, I highly recommend this pump. Thank you!",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I didn't have a problew with anything leaking (i.e. bottles,caps, pump...).  In fact as my daughter was begining to teeth and trying to use me the pump helped to releive my soreness and encourage her to eat correctly.  I have not had any problems with gas, spitting up or colic.  My friends that use this system all think it is wonderful and will never use any other type again.  They also have enjoyed no colic, minimal gas and spit-ups.  The pump is comfortable, easy to use and everthing is easy to clean.",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"Although I haven't been using this pump for very long, I've been able to get very good results. Of course, pumping takes practice but this pump works great for beginners. It is very easy to set up and clean...making it easy to take along. I also like that the bottles fit onto the pump-nothing extra to buy (and clean). I also have an electric pump but prefer this pump when I am home during the day. I find that I can more quickly get it ready and am able to pump one side as soon as my baby is finished nursing on the other side. I definitely recommend having a manual pump, even if you plan on or already have an electric.",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I am in love with this pump - I just started back to work after a 12 week maternity leave and was in need of a good breast pump to continue nursing my daughter. I couldn't decide whether to bite the bullet and purchase a Medela Pump in Style or this one. I have had an electric pump in the past (First Years Dual Pump) and really didn't care for it - it was so noisy, at times wouldn't have great suction, as ws awkward to handle while breastfeeding my baby on one side. I felt like I was constantly prisoner to the electric outlet sine I couldn't move anywhere since it was so comlicated to get everything together.This pump was quiet, fast (8 ounces in under 15 minutes from both breasts) and needed no electric outlet. At first I was afraid my hand would get sore, but no problem at all. I had better luck w/out the petal cushion - this just didn't work for me, and I've never had a problem stimulating letdown without it.I am so glad I didn't purchase a PIS, I also love the bottles, they're the only kind my baby will use!",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"This breast pump is so easy to use and so convenient.  I love the fact that I can control the pump and I can take it ANYWHERE!  I use it everywhere I need to including the car.  I love the accessories that it comes with.  I can pump my milk and place the nipple right onto the bottle and feed my baby.  I can't tell you how many times I've done that. There are several parts to wash and you can only do one breast at a time, but it's completely easy to use.  I used the medela dual electric pump with my first child, and I have to say I am so happy with this breast pump-mostly because of convenience.",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I had to go to school full time and work about 30 hours a week, so I needed a good pump. This pump did not help me at all! It was very hard to use.  I tried so many times to pump milk and the farthest I got was a couple of drops!  The pump felt really awkward and it takes so long! I started manually expressing milk and that worked about a million times better. If you're serious about pumping milk, buy an electric pump thats quick and efficient. Don't waste your money or time with this pump. It's still sitting in my closet.",1
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"With so mant great reviews, I am sure I am doing something wrong!  I love the case and accessories but I cannot get decent suction to pump any milk.  My husband and I have rechecked assembly and all parts to make sure it is working as it was intended but still nothing.  Please, someone, tell me what I'm doing wrong - I really want to love this pump!",2
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"in the technical specs it says there is no warranty but if you save the packaging and have any problems, contact the number on it and they will help you out.",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I got this pump for my shower and it was wonderful at first. 2 to 3weeks later it just got me fustrated and i almost smashed it a number of times. It kept loosing suction and i would spend hours trying to pump 2 ounces of milk. It actually became faster expressing manually,then i had to look for something else, after complaining to avent and not getting a solution.With the new pump.. harmony medela, I discovered that the cup for the avent was too big for me,(Used a size 34 A cup before pregnancy.)and it would not fit on the valves that the baby usally sucks on to stimulate letdown.Thus would not write off the pump as bad but do check which fits the type of your nipple.",2
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I bought this set thinking it was a bit more than I needed, but I actually used everything in the set. The variety of bottles is great and they come with sealing lids, nipples and caps- very convenient! The cooling packs are effective and the carrying case IS discreet and lightweight. Now about the pump: I think it's great for pumping once or twice a week, but not daily. &quot;Back to Work&quot; is a bit of a misnomer for this pump because it's not really efficient enough or durable enough for frequent daily use.The pump is very lightweight, silent, and very effective as manual pumps go, but even when you get good with it (it takes practice &amp; patience at first), it's not as quick as a double-sided electric pump. I gave it only 4 stars because the pump also seemed very fragile. After only a month of light use, I had to utilize all the replacement parts included in the set.All in all, if you need a pump for going back to work, consider a double-sided electric pump for quick and hard use. But if you only need to pump occasionally, are going on a trip, or just need a manual backup, I recommend the Avent Isis!",4
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I never would have rented my hospital grade pump ...I just used it for the first time and had no problem pumping 4 ounces in about 15 minutes.  The suction is very good; I have tough breasts and can use it at full suction, but if you are more tender you simply don't depress the handle all the way.  I bought extra storage jars and nipples so I can take plenty of milk to day care and have enough containers to pump while I'm at work.  The set comes with two #1 (0-1 month) nipples; I bought #2 nipples locally for my 2 month old.This is now on my must-recommend list for all expectant mothers!",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"If you are going back to work and pumping full time you will probably want to go electric, but as far as hand pumps go, this one is great.  Great suction if you put it together right (there is a little piece that if you put it in upside-down you get frustratingly little suction if any at all.) The cup is comfortable though it does puddle a small amount.  I have not noticed any other leaks in this unit.  It is small, compact and able to produce 4 ounces in under 15 minutes.",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I bought this set after my second child was born.  With the first I had used a Medela Pump in Style and hated having to lug the thing around and embarrassed at the attention the sounds of the pump drew from people in the office.I'm glad I made the switch. While I did pump slightly less milk than I did with the electric pump, I felt a million times better throughout the process. I could sneak into an unused room and read a book while I silently took care of business. Portability was a big plus for me as well. I could store the milk in the lunchroom fridge without fear that it might be mistakenly used. I would recommend this pump to any and every nursing mother.",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I was given a Medela Pump N Style when I was pregnant and spent a month trying to use it before getting frustrated and investigating other options.  I purchased the Avent Isis On the Go after much research, and it has worked wonders.  Not only was the electric pump loud and inconvenient to use, it was also an extremely slow process.  With the Isis, I can pump the same amount of milk in less than half the time.  I work full time, and the Isis is much easier to transport, put together, and use.  If you want to speed up even more, buy two pumps and pump both breasts at once.  You will still save 60%+ over the cost of a Medela.  Hands down the best pump on the market!",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I have really enjoyed using this pump!  I bought the Medela Single Deluxe breastpump, and it was just too noisy and drove my husband nuts.  The Avent ISIS works great, and I am able to pump just as much milk in the same amount of time without the noise. The bag allows me to take it anywhere.  I love the whole Avent system and not having to pump and dump the milk into another storage bottle is great.",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"After reading everyone's great reviews, I decided to register for this pump.  I am sad to say that I could not get a drip out.  The suction is very poor and I would have to imagine that it would take a good hour to get any amount of breastmilk to come out if it did work!  I am very disappointed in a wasted gift.  The only pump that does work is the Medela Pump In Style electric pump, which unfortunately is over $300.00.I would not recommend this pump.",1
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I bought this pump and rented an electric pump.  Even though this takes a bit longer, I prefer this one.  I think it is easy to use and I feel like I get more using this one.  I also like the interchangeable bottles and storage containers. The only drawback is that there are quite a few parts and with the number of times I pump, it's a lot of washing.  But it's the same with the electric pump too, so I think it's just part of the game!",4
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"My friend gave me her pump when she was finished with it, I just boiled all the parts, and then threw them in the dishwasher.  Anyway, the pump is fine for a bottle, I only use it once in the day, but during the pumping time it will lose it's suction or you have to get it on just right before it will really get the milk quantity you want.  It took me about 4 times (4 days) to figure out  how the pump suction needs to be for myself.The other complaint I have with the pump is the parts that screw together to make the pump complete come unscrewed throughout the pump time.  (the bottle, and the other screwed on piece to the pump.)  This is really anoying while you're trying to pump.Overall it's ok, but I think I can find another one.",3
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"This pump is, hands down, the best there is. I tried a Medela single electric and it was so noisy that I couldn't hear my husband or the TV while using it. The Avent Isis is quiet, super fast, and inexpensive. I am able to pump just as much with it as the Medela in the same amount of time. Plus, their customer service is great! They sent me complementary valves when I lost one of mine. Now that my baby is getting older, I am able to pump directly into the Avent sippy cups. I would recommend this to everyone",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,I have been using this pump for over 5 years. I used it with my first and now with my recent child (3months old). I have used the Medela pumps (nice but pricey)and found although this is sometimes messy (petals do keep some milk) but it is well worth pumping anywhere and everywhere discreetly. (Traveling) It is also compact. I have had one bottle leak because I placed it in the dishwasher now I wash them by hand.,4
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"My husband bought this breastpump on the recommendation of the store clerks at [our local store] while I was in the hospital. I wanted one because my baby was in the ICU and I wanted to be sure my milk come in since she could not breastfeed right away. The clerk also told him he absolutely could not return it once it was opened. No wonder they have that policy! No one would keep this pump otherwise! It is loud but that would have been ok if it actually expressed milk. I got 2 oz out of it at the most but usually even less than that even after my milk came in. I still can't get milk using it even a month after the birth of my baby. While it was not painful to use, it is certainly uncomfortable. This is a waste of [money]!",1
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"Okay so I don't have hands-on experience but I did all of the research and have witnessed my wife's success with this pump.  This has been a pretty good pump for the money.  Yes it's more noisy than the expensive ones but it pumps just as well.  We know because at one point when we thought the pump was broken my wife was able to borrow a ""Pump In Style"" and one of those very expensive industrial strength hospital pumps so we were able to compare the three. As it turned out, with all of the spare parts we had available we determined that the problem was with the plastic suction cup part and not the actual pump itself. This may be what ""Tracy from Houston"" experienced based on her reveiw. But in comparing the three, the volume and rate at which the milk was extracted seemed to be the same for all three.  Of course the hospital model was much more durable and the Pump In Style had many more features and both were more quiet, but for the frequency that my wife uses it (a few times a week in the privacy of our own home) we feel that it performs very well and we're on our second child. And it doesn't seem that loud to me, but then again I'm usually in the other room watching the Diamondbacks ;-)",5
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"I was surprised to see the many negative or lukewarm reviews for this product.  I think it really points out that every woman and her breasts work differently ...I used this pump initially with my first child (until getting a double pump for time efficiency when going back to work), and periodically thereafter.  The double pump that everyone raves about was quicker (both breasts at the same time, IF I had 2 hands free to hold the bottles in place; otherwise 1 at a time), and was quieter ( a little). I tired of lugging the double in and out of the car, and would usually leave it in the car to take in and out to work, while continuing to use the ""mini"" at home.  I found that the ""mini"" worked very well, and  was as effective as the double.It's  a little louder (but we're talking maybe vaccum cleaner, not jet engine!) and even when I was nursing baby on one side and pumping on the other, baby wasn't bothered by it. (which, by the way, is a bit awkward at first but by no means requires acrobatics, and was very helpful for me in maintaining enough supply for when I was at work)  No, I wouldn't talk on the phone with it.I think for most people with the need to pump occasionally to go out, not necessarily a mom returning to work  with limited time to pump at work, the ""mini"" is more than adequate, and very affordable.By the way, I successfully nursed 3 children for their entire first year, while returning to a very demanding job at 3-4months with each of them.  Yes, you can do this!!Good luck and enjoy to all you nursing moms out there - remember, ""eat at mom's - it's best!""",4
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"I absolutely love this pump.  Unlike the other reviews I do not find it to be loud.  Maybe this is because I have used other pumps such as the Evenflow (awful do not buy), which is pretty loud.  I have recommended it to all my friends and plan to go on doing so.  I have been back to work for 2 weeks now and I have been pumping 3 times a day.  It has yet to disappoint me.  For those of you that need a good Breast Pump this one is for you.  Although I do not use the battery option so I do not know how well it works off batteries.  Good Luck Breastfeeding it is the best thing for baby :-)",5
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"I originally purchased this pump because I used the Medela Classic and Lactina pumps at work.  I thought that since they were made by the same manufacturer and employed the same bottle/tubing system, they would be comparable.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  Unfortunately, this little motor can't even begin to compare to the hospital pumps.  Electric does not mean it works well.  I couldn't even get one ounce after pumping for 20 minutes.  I used this pump three times, then gave up completely.  This was the biggest waste of money I made when I was shopping for a reliable pump.I had planned to use this pump in the middle of the night when my son got up and nursed on only one side.  I thought I could feed, pump, and still remain only half-awake.  Big mistake!  I was unpleasantly surprised at how *very* loud the motor is.  I tried using it in the evening while watching the news, but I couldn't hear the tv!  Plus, the motor is a little heavy for the bottle, so when I set it down, the whole thing toppled over and spilled all the milk.As for the power of the motor, it seemed very feeble.  I didn't feel much suction when using it, and the motor goes through suck and release pulses to mimic a baby (like with the Classic and Lactina.)  You can't alter the amount of time the suction is on (like w/ the Lactina) and the brief suction times prevented me from ""letting down"" and being able to express any milk.  There wasn't enough power, and no way to increase it.Since I wanted to have comparable results at home when I didn't use the hospital-grade pumps, I switched to the Isis hand-pump and was much happier.  After a while, I used the Isis pump exclusively.",1
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,I have overused this product and it's still going! I pumped probably twice a day for a month and a half to create a supply in my freezer for when I go back to work. I have never had a problem with suction and the motor is still going strong. I would have to give this a five star rating.,5
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"I got this pump at my shower and I regret not having looked around for a better pump. My son gained  over 2 lbs in two weeks so I know he's getting enough when he nurses, but I struggle at times to get ONE ounce, sometimes two if I'm lucky. Even if I take a hot shower first to encourage let down, still no luck. It's a piece of crap.",1
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"This pump is practical and easy to use.  I used it successfully for two pregnancies.  The motor finally broke when I tried to make it work twice as hard for a set of twins.Assembly is simple, you can adjust the suction strength to your own comfort levels, and I was able to get a minimum of four ounces per breast.  For first time moms and moms who have previously be exposed to formula fed babies, keep in mind that breast fed babies eat less per feeding, but more frequently, so 3 ounces is fine! Also, you will need to condition yourself to ""let down"" when you pump.  If you do not let down, you will only be able to pump the foremilk, and it will most likely hurt!  I suggest pumping on one side while you nurse your baby on the other side, in this way you will experience a let down while pumping and get out that rich hindmilk, which is what keeps baby full and happy!  Once you are conditioned you will be able to pump without baby's help.Most problems many women have with pumps have to do with their comfort levels. If you can't relax you won't let down, and you can pump for all your worth, the milk won't come out.  Baby gets milk out by massaging your breast and stimulating your nipple, inducing let down.Basically what I am tring to say is that it isn't so much the PUMP as it is YOU.  Relax!!!  This pump works just fine.I used it on a cross county driving trip when my daughter was 3 months old. I pumped milk from the front seat (buy the car adapter!) and passed the bottles back to my mom so we didn't have to pull over every 2 hours to nurse.  It was great! I am a stay at home mom. I recommend this for the mom who wants to give the occasional bottle to her baby for convenience(no more than twice a day).  It is not a workhorse.  Meant for occasional, supplemental  use.",4
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"I have this breast pump and have been using it for 9 months.  I just stopped breastfeeding.  You can use it anywhere because it has a battery option and a manual option.  A baby bottle screws right onto the bottom.  I don't see any need for special breast milk containers.  I much prefer the one breast at a time models.  I used to use the more expensive two breast model when my daughter was a preemie and still in the hospital.  I thought it was a pain in the butt because it has so many parts to clean.  It may be quicker to pump both breasts at once, but then you have to clean twice as many parts.  This pump has only two pieces which have to be cleaned after each use.  That is if you use the same baby bottle to store the milk as you use to feed the milk.  Compare this with around eight pieces for the two breast at a time models.  If you don't have time to wait for the dishwasher to run or the dishwasher is not full, then you have to wash them all by hand for as many times a day as you pump your breasts.  It can get really annoying.  I noticed someone else mentioning that their pump's motor stopped working.  I have to slap mine against my hand once in a while to get the motor going.  Don't ask me why.  I expect to use the same pump for my future children.  Mine still works.",5
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"I ORIGINALLY BOUGHT THIS PUMP TO EXPRESS MILK AT WORK. HOWEVER, WHEN I TRIED IT OUT AT HOME THE MOTOR MADE TOO MUCH NOISE, EVEN FOR HOME USE! IMAGINE USING IT OUTSIDE THE HOME! I SUGGEST YOU BUY THE MEDELA HARMONY MANUAL BREAST PUMP TO USE IN THE WORK PLACE INSTEAD. ONLY BUY THIS  ELECTRIC/ BATTERY PUMP IF YOU DON'T MIND THE NOISE BECAUSE OTHERS WILL BE SURE TO HEAR IT. ON THE PLUS SIDE --IT IS VERY EASY TO CARRY AND EASY TO ASSEMBLE. AND THIS PUMP IS ONLY FOR OCCASIONAL USE, LIKE IT SAYS ON THE BOX, NOT FOR FREQUENT USE-- FOR THAT GO FOR THE PUMP IN STYLE WHICH WORKS TERRIFIC.",3
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"I had the Avent Isis disposable system and sometimes it would take 30 minutes or more to get a couple ounces.  After purchasing this item I have been successfully getting 6 oz or more in a matter of about 15 minutes!  The item is a little noisy but leaves one of your hands free to keep entertaining the baby, unlike the Avent that takes both hands to make it work.  I am selling the Avent and LOVING the medela.  For the price difference, I should have just bought the Medela first.",5
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"I was really excited to find a Medela pump i could afford, but after 2 months of trial and error, I am giving up and buying a new pump. This pump is loud, rough on my breasts and after 30 minutes of pumping I can only get out 1 ounce or less. Also it is already loosing suction. Save your $60 and put it towards a quality pump. I am getting the Lanisoah double pump. I have researched it a lot and it is the only pump i cant find a truly bad review on. Everyone is different and if you have very small breasts and are only wanting to pump a couple times a week this pump may work for you, but I would not recommend it to a friend.",2
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"I like this pump, but I must admit I haven't used any other. After a few weeks, the suction just stopped. I noticed that the little rubber gasket was warped, and it didn't hold the seal.  The pump came with 2 replacement gaskets. I switched it out, and was back in business.  I noticed some of the other reviewers had similar problems, but it was their motor.  Check the gasket first! I've been using mine for 2 months now, once or twice per day. Yes, it's kinda noisy-- but again, I have nothing to compare it to.Also, the connection on the pump is the same size as Gerber bottles.  I got an Avent bottle set for my shower, which has a wide mouth-- I can't pump directly into the Avent bottle. I have to pump into the Medela bottle that comes with the set, then pour the milk into the Avent bags for storage. A small inconvenience.  Keep this in mind if you're registering for bottle starter sets.",4
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"I bought this pump after having used the Avent Isis. I went to full expression for my baby and ended up spending several hours on the pump everyday, so getting an electric was clearly a must!This pump works, and you don't end up with sore muscles as with the Avent Isis. At the same time, I am not convinced it is as efficient as the Avent Isis... The good point is that I have one hand free when using this pump, which I did not have with the Isis. The bad point is that I probably spend a bit more time with this one than I would need with a better pump. And it is REALLY loud, so there is no way I can watch a DVD while expressing.As I plan to carry on to express several times per day, I am getting a Medela pump in style, everybody says it's a great pump, and the double pumping will no doubt save me time.",3
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"I agonized over whether to buy this cheaper pump or go straight to one of the high-end ($250+) models. In an effort to save money I started with this one. But I quickly realized I'd made a mistake -- it took *forever* to even get one ounce of milk. I ended up getting the Medela Pump In Style and loved it. I just wish I'd gone straight to that one and saved my money on this one.For those of you who are trying to decide between this or a more expensive model, here are my two cents:TRY THIS ONE IF...- You have a very abundant milk supply- You only plan to pump one or twice a month- You wouldn't mind giving your baby formula if you had to be away from her for an extended periodINVEST THE MONEY IN A HIGHER-END MODEL IF...- You're going back to work- Your milk supply is medium to low- You plan to pump more than two or three times per month- You are opposed to giving your baby any formula, ever (with a higher quality pump you could build up reserve breastmilk to have in case of an emergency)Also, it's worth noting that most of the more expensive models can be safely re-used by other people so could be sold to someone else when you're done (unlike this one).",2
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"I have been using the Pump In Style both at work and home but I wanted a pump for home so that I could stop carrying the larger one back and forth. I got this one and just about threw it across the room the first time I tried to use it.It is very loud, very weak, and sort of mashed my breast tissue. I started to have occasional painful twinges in one of my breasts after starting to use this pump, and since I stopped that has gone away. I had been using it with the AC adapter but on a business trip had to use it with battery and that was even wimpier.If I hadn't already been using the Pump In Style I think I would have just concluded that pumping is miserable and doesn't work. Luckily I know better - instead I know that this is just a piece of crap product. Please, don't waste your money on this! Buy or borrow a proper pump and it will make all the difference in your comfort, production, time, and will quite probably make it possible for you to breastfeed for longer.",1
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,i've been using a hand pump for the last 6 weeks and basically stopped pumping for a couple weeks because it was so time consuming and labor intensive (sore hand/arm) I just got this pump yesterday and it is definitely not super effective but it is much more effective than a hand pump for me and its nice to not have to be squeezing the thing the whole time. For engorgement it is less painful than the hand pump. Of course I have a well established milk supply and am 6 weeks post baby so I am not using it to specifically increase my supply so much as to ensure that I always have some milk in the freezer for outings. I try to pump a few times a day so that I have at least one whole bottle's worth pumped every day. I can easily get a couple of ounces out at a time and I think its faster than a hand pump too.,4
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"I started out using the Avent Isis manual pump and it would take me 20+ mins to get 2 ozs so my lactation specialist reccomended that I switch to this pump and I love it!  I can pump over 5 ozs in less than 10 mins.  This pump does not hurt as much as the Avent pump did.  It is loud, but if you don't plan on using it in public then thats not a problem.  I use this pump every morning and I've had it for over a month now and it still works great.  I'd reccomend it to anyone who needs a pump for occasional pumping.",5
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"I received this pump as a gift.  I like it because it is electric.  I got the manual attachment free from the hospital and it is very difficult to use even with the spring loading.  For manual use I recommend the Avent Isis.  However, there are times when I just feel like sitting down and not having to manually pump.  This works great.  It comes with storage containers and a nipple insert for smaller nipples.  Plus it comes with some lanolin just incase you get sore nipples.  It is a pretty good buy.  It doesn't work any better than a manual, but it is more convenient since you don't have to work as hard.  I wouldn't have bought it myself, but since it was given to me, I am glad to have it.  :)",4
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"I have a 10 month baby and since i was a new mom i decide to buy a cheap pump at first, but i was very suprise to find such great quality at such low invesment. I use the pump 3 times or more a day and its still working (10 months. Portable. At first it hurts a little since nipples are sore, but after couple of uses its natural and pain free. replacement parts are easy to find amazon or babiesrus.",5
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,This product I used with my first child 12 years ago and bought it as a gift for my sister recently. I have tried many brands and this one is great quality and great price. You will not be disappointed.,5
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,My local WIC office gave me this pump when my First Year's pump seemed like it was on the fritz. Let's just say I went back to my old pump because it still worked better than this one even when it wasn't working right. This one is just a huge waste of time and money. The suction is poor and unnatural and I can't even get let down with it. I can barely get an ounce out of a side at a time. I've borrowed one of Medela's higher end pumps from a friend in the past and thought that this one would carry on with the company's high quality and standards that I'm used to but it definitely does not! Don't waste your time and money. Look around for another pump instead.,1
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,My son is only four months old and I didn't even start pumping until he was 2 months old to start storing some milk.  I usually pump about four times a week and I went to pump this morning and there was no suction!  Spend the extra money and buy a better pump.  I've heard a lot of good things about the whisper wear pump and ordered one of those today to replace this pump--medela doesn;t even make a car adapter for this pump,1
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"I've used this pump since my daughter was about 1 month old.  It is very easy to use and has been very efficient for me.  I don't pump everyday since I'm a stay at home mom, but do several times a week for use when I'm not around.  I use the breastmilk bags for freezing and although I normally use the Avent bottles, I've found that the Gerber bottles are interchangeable with the one you attach to the pump.  This makes it easy if you just want to pump and go without transferring to another bottle.  I highly recommend this pump.  A friend told me that it's a bit noisier than her Medela Pump N Style, but a little white noise never hurt anyone :-)",5
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"It is true. . . this pump is not quiet.  However, if you don't have to worry about who hears and you are pumping to have bottles for convienence out and about etc., then this pump is good for you.  I am a stay at home mom and I pump to have bottles for outings and so daddy can feed the baby sometimes.  It works perfect for that and is much more economical than some other ones.  I can pump about 5 to 6 oz in about 10 - 15  minutes (I am sure this varies depending on each person's supply) and the pump is comfortable to use. I have only had it about a week so, I can't comment about other people's comments that the motor stops working after only 2 months.",4
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"I have been using this pump from the moment I left the hospital with my baby 3 and a half months ago.  I used it every day for the first month to establish my milk supply and now I use it only when I am going out and have to have a bottle ready for the babysitter.I have to say that it is VERY loud but it does the job.  I use it in the privacy of my home so it doesn't matter how loud it is.  I recently went on a 7 hour road trip and used it in the car as well.  When not plugged into an electric outlet, the pump is a little bit slower but it still helped me excrete 4 ounces in 15 minutes with the battery option.  That's not bad at all.If I were going back to work full time, I would invest in the $250 Medela double pump.  But for my lifestyle now, this pump has worked very well.  My maternity nurse reccommended this pump to me.I have gotten so well at pumping that I could nurse my baby on one breast, pump the other and talk on the phone at the same time!!  =)",5
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,This is not the right pump to buy if you are trying to increase supply.  You'll need to rent a hospital pump for that.  This pump is nicely designed and will work fine to relieve engorgement or simply to remove milk.,3
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"My sister in law gave this to me for my first child after she used it to help nurse her two sons. After helping me with my first and second child, I now gave it to my other sister in law. For a first time mother,nervous about nursing she was able to pump 3 oz her first day home with the newborn (1st time to ever use a pump) and 6 oz her next time she needed to use it. I was happy to help her out with such a realiable product at such a delicate time. To think that pump is 6 years old!!!!!",5
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"I tried a hospital pump & a highly advertised manual pump before this one and it was a nightmare. When I tried this pump I couldn't believe how comfortable it was, and how much milk I pumped so effortlessly in such a short amount of time. My baby is 11 days old, and last night I pumped 3 1/2 ounces in 5-10 minutes. It is louder than my manual (obviously), but not nearly as loud as the hospital pump I used while my baby was in the NICU.I think many mothers are trying to pump before their milk supply is established & that is why it hurts & why they aren't getting any milk. That is what happened to me in the hospital...even with the hospital grade pump you won't get anything if your milk isn't ready to be pumped!",5
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"When I first brought my daughter home I used a manual pump but that took too long to get just a few ounces.  I bought this pump and could pump up to 6 oz. on one breast at a time.  I used my pump to build up my stored breastmilk for when my daughter began eating solids.  I pumped each morning and sometimes 1-2 times during the night for her first year of life.  Once she started weening herself, then my milk supply naturally started to become less and less.  However I used this pump each day and was able to have breastmilk stored for my daughter until she was 16 months old.  I recommend this pump because of the small, portable size, price, and convenience of using it.  Each pumping session took about total of 10 minutes (5 on each breast).  Each time I used my pump I only used the plug.  I never used the batteries and my motor did not start to go out until the time I stopped pumping.  I attribute that to having used it daily for over a year.",5
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"I purchased this produce and the device started to fail just a few months after the purchase. The device was used maybe a few times per month so it wasn't overused. I called Madela and I was able to get it working again through troubleshooting the problem. I used it a few times after that and then maybe 4 months later I needed to use it again and could not. I called Madela to trouble shoot and the woman told me that after the 1st troubleshoot call the motor started breaking down because of the method of troubleshooting so now that the warranty is up (6 months) all they could do was offer me a 20% discount from what they charge which would make the purchase price the same as buying it on Amazon.com. The person who initially did the troubleshooting should have told me about the motor so I could get another pump within my warranty. Now, I have to spend money on another pump. This product is unreliable and the company has terrible customer service. DO NOT BUY IT!",1
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"I'm not in need for more then 1-2 pumpings daily (if that), so this pump was very ideal. It works very well and very easy to store and clean. Because there is a motor, it makes a loud humming noise which can be distracting if you're trying to pump and feed at the same time. Overall, I'm very pleased the pump. My friend uses the same one more frequently and is also very happy!",4
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,It works and it is nice to have the battery so your not trapped in one location but I need something for both breast and something with a little more power for everyday use so I bought the deluxe pump made by them..,3
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"Everyone tries to tell you that any breastpump that is any less than a hospital grade will not work if you are going back to work full time.  But I found that this one worked just fine, I could pump for 15 minutes twice a day, and it worked great.  I ended up not breastfeeding for as long as I had thought, and I am very glad I didn't spend $200-$300 on a breastpump.  This one still works great, and I plan to use it for my next child.  Not everyone needs a hospital grade pump, don't let people convince you of that.  I gave it a 4 because it was a little loud, but not too bad.",4
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"After about 5 uses the suction was low.  It didn't matter what setting you placed it on,  It was so low milk did not express from the breast even if my breast were engorged. I now have to spend more money then expected for a pump.",1
Cosco Portable Crib - White,It's perfect for people without a lot of extra room.  It's very sturdy.,5
Cosco Portable Crib - White,"Do not recall when we bought this product (somewhere in the last 3 years) but we used it with no problems for at least one other child.  Our baby is now 10 weeks and within the last week or two on two occasions, the board of the crib slipped and child ended up on the floor while sliding out between the board and the metal frame.  Possibly because of the repeated use (though I would not call our use of it as rough) but it is too dangerous to use it.",1
Cosco Portable Crib - White,"In the middle of a summer heatwave my husband and I were faced with either disassembling our 7 month old's huge crib and moving it into our air conditioned bedroom for a more comfortable sleep, or getting a portable crib which can also be used later in the year when Baby #2 is due.  We purchased this and are delighted.  It assembled in under 10 minutes, which is unusual since most baby items take several people and loads of patience to figure out complicated directions.  This crib is light weight yet sturdy, nicely compliments any room, and is comfortable for our daughter for either sleep or play. It handles easily and can roll between doorways with no problem.  We gave it only three stars because I felt the metal bars were spaced too far apart and are not baby-friendly since the standard portable crib bedding doesn't come up high enough to protect little heads from getting bumped.  Our child already hit her head twice and the bedding did nothing to cushion the blow.  All in all it's a fine item and priced well.  We'll get better use out of it when the second baby comes since we don't have lots of space to fit another full size crib.",3
Cosco Portable Crib - White,"I found this porta-crib to be a very wise investment. For the price, I don't think I could have found a better crib. It has many features that you just would not find in the wooden cribs.It has sides that fold in for easy storage and 2 levels to place your child on. For the younger babies, there is a higher level. For older babies that are more mobile, you can place them on the lower level (about the same level as a regular crib). The mattress that came with this crib was of much better quality than the mattresses that came with other porta-cribs that I looked at.After looking at many different cribs, I am very happy with this one.",4
Cosco Portable Crib - White,"These are great, sturdy cribs.  This is the only crib we use in our Church nursery.  The metal is easy to keep clean and sanitary, and does not get worn out over time like wood cribs.  Three of these cribs fit in the space of two full size cribs, too, which is great when space is at a premium.",5
Cosco Portable Crib - White,These are sturdy cribs that hold up well.  I own a daycare and these are used a lot daily.  They still look new!  I have had some for 3 years!,5
Cosco Portable Crib - White,"great crib, easy to assemble (it was pretty much assembled when it arrived!) My 6 month old son who is almost 20 pounds fits well in it, but I had to double wrap a bumper pad around it so he wouldn't roll into the cold metal! I am not sure how long he will fit into it, but I love its portability and how I feel there is no rush to move my happy 2 yr old out of his crib. And its overall best feature is how you can roll it from room to room without taking it apart.",5
Cosco Portable Crib - White,"We loved the size, look and sturdiness of this portable crib.  Our 4 month old is quickly getting too large for her bassinet and this seemed like the perfect step up.Even with a portable bumper pad, my baby keeps kicking her leg through the rail while laying down.  I have to keep a sharp eye on her as I'm afraid that she will break her leg.  I first noticed this problem a few days ago as she was crying and when I turned around, her leg was sticking out.I pretty much only put her in it when she's super drousy but I'm going to take it back and get a play yard as I don't want to take any chances.  I already have a play yard at her daycare center and didn't want to get another one, but it will be so worth the peace of mind.This crib would be great for babies that don't like to kick as mine does.  She's a little wiggle worm!",4
Cosco Portable Crib - White,"We purchased this as the primary crib for our second child to save on space and knowing at times we would need to move the crib between rooms.  I absolutely love it!  It is very sturdy, looks great and best of all rolls through doorways!!!.  I assumed I would be able to use the crib for only several months when I puchased it, but as our little guy is approaching 12 months I have no intention of pulling the full size crib out of storage anytime soon.  He has plenty of room to move around, in fact, far more than I have in my bed. By far the best piece of furniture/gear I have purchased between 2 children.....",5

The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,I had this item for almost 3 months. One night my wife noticed that instead of the orange button lighting up the entire inside of the unit was turning orange. I realized that the item was on fire as soon as I started to smell melting plastic.The bottle warmer was really convenient and I hope that I was the only one to have this sort of issue. If I'm not The First Years should be putting out a product recall.,1

The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,Purchased when my child started formula exclusively. Works perfect with my doctor browns bottles. Makes the early morning so much easier to deal with.,5
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"We also got this as a shower gift.  I am sorry I ever registered for this.  A pan of warm water on the stove does a better job than this piece of crap.  This thing heats up the bottles (4 oz) so hot I was almost afraid the bottles would melt.  And w/ a 6 oz bottle you had to heat it up twice, but had to add cold water and then drain it before it would allow you to turn it back on.  And if you put too much water in there (which you have to add MORE than just the two itsy bitsy little spitfulls of water they tell you to put in there w/ these stupid little camera film looking containers), then this unit will leak the water from the bottom and discharge it all over your countertop.  How fun is that?  Plus, when I'd go to turn it off, I would see a flicker inside the on/off clicker.  What's up w/ that?  To me, this is an electrical dangerous hazard piece of crap.  I thought this would save me time, but if you put hot tap water into a pan and put it on a stove, it works better and it DOES NOT LEAK!  PLEASE please please do not waste your money.  It's not worth it.  Sometimes doing things the old fashioned way is the best way and always will be.",1
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"We bought this warmer after returning the Munchkin brand warmer (which never heated enough).  We don't have use for the cooler portion of this product, but the warmer has worked great for my husband, who is usually the one to use it.  He hasn't had any problems adjusting the water level and has never had to resort to running the bottle under hot water from the faucet.  It takes up more counter space than we'd like, but it works and that makes it worth it.",4
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,Im trying to decide what to get off an Amway gift card. This bottle warmer was one of the options. They have many other products but a bottle warmer sounds great IF it works. However how am I supposed to know if it does or not? The reviews are extremely mixed.56 - 5 star62 - 4 star28 - 3 star35 - 2 stars72 - 1 starThe combined 5 star and 4 star ratings encourage me to choose this product but then the awful 1 star and 2 star rating discourage me. One reviewer even said its a fire hazard. Others say its great and warms the bottles if you follow instructions. Then people say it doesn't warm them at all. I've never read such extremely different sided reviews on one product.,3
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"This product is must have for night feedings! It warms the bottles up quickly! The only thing I would suggest is playing around with the amount of water needed to warm each bottle/amount of formula. The suggested amounts are just that, SUGGESTIONS. I found I needed more water then what was told. I use glass bottles at night because they heat up very quickly.I also suggest ordering EXTRA ice packs (they are cheap-$1.99) as one really isn't enough when you forget to put back into freezer. I also clean once a week because a weird brown residue forms under the plastic bottle holder thing. Definitely a must have for night feedings! SO GLAD I BOUGHT THIS!",5
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"After trying and returning every bottle warmer at babies r us this one is a winner!  I wish I would have bought it first.  It warms my bottles (Dr.Brown's wide neck 4oz) perfectly every time!!!  We keep it in the baby's room so the cooler part is perfect for late night/early morning feedings.  Before I go to bed I place 2 bottles in the cooler and fill the water holders.  This saves a lot of time in the middle of the night. Instead of going to the kitchen then the baby's room I go to her room place the bottle in the warmer, change her diaper, talk to her a little and the bottle is ready. Perfect every time!  At first you do need to play around with the amount of water your bottles need.  After you get that figured out you cant have a better warmer. Unless you found one that only takes a couple of seconds!! Until then we cant live without this warmer!",5
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,I received this bottle warmer as a gift. it works ok every now and then. you do have to read the instructions carefully to get a perfect bottle. if you have to little amount of water it leaves the milk as cold as can be then you have to wait 10 minutes to start over (not fun with a screaming baby). sometimes even with the right amount of water it can make the milk to hot.then you have to wait for it to cool down (also not fun). I have given up using my warmer. its much faster to put the bottle under hot running water.,3
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"This warmer is a piece of junk.  You will not only burn yourself taking the bottle out of the warmer, but it will burn your little one's mouth too.  Don't waste your $$$$.",1
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"I was SO thrilled with this bottle warmer, that now I get it for everyone when they have a baby and are using bottles.  This was wonderful when my little guy was a newborn sleeping in his bassinet in our room and woke up to eat.  I would grab the little cylinder of water dump it in, put the bottle in, turn it on.  Then I would grab my little guy and change his diaper.  When I was done his bottle was all warmed up and ready to go, I barely needed even a nightlight.  This way he understood it was ok to eat, but that it was still night time and we were going to go back to sleep and it worked!!!  I LOVE this SO much!!",5
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"This product is great if you have a two story house.  It is not much fun going downstairs to warm a bottle in the middle of the night--that is if you can make it without falling down the stairs in your sleep-deprived condition.  It does take some practice figuring out how much water works best to get it the temperature you want.  I use a little less water for 4oz bottles.  Also, taking the bottle out and swirling it about half way through seems to help.  (Usually by the time I'm done changing my baby's diaper, it is half way through.)  Be sure you add the water in each time...if you forget and run the warmer, you won't get very warm milk...and you have to wait awhile to try again.",4
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,I received this bottle warmer as a gift!  I love it!  It sure has made a difference - it heats the bottle faster than a pot of water can boil!  I recommend this!  My daughter loves the warm the bottles!,5
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"The warmer always gets 4 oz bottles too warm, no matter how much water you out it. The larger bottles sometimes don't get warm enough.  My baby had colic and waiting for the bottles was torture. I gave this unit to charity.",3
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"We hated this product.  IT doesnt tell you when the bottles are ready.  I dont find it safe at all.  For a mother of twins, this is not a good idea.  At 3 in the  morning with crying hungry babies, a timer or shut off button would be nice.It boils up and over every single time.  No matter how much water you put in it it will always sputter and make a mess on the cabinet.",1
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"works in seconds, and the light on the button makes nights very easy for breastmilk and formula. I love it",5
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"I bought this for my partner when I went back to work and he scoffed at me, telling me it was silly and not necessary.  I work nights though, and wanted it to be as easy for him as it could be.  He's since apologized and told me that he thinks this product is fabulous.  He uses it every time he warms up a bottle, even though we keep it in the bedroom.  The cooler works exactly as expected and I love that he doesn't have to run to the kitchen to get the milk or have another cooler in the room.  He said that glass bottles really don't work as they get too hot and he'd like it if the cooler held different size bottles, but all in all, it's a great product and I'm delighted that it's been such a help to him.",5
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"I wish there was a 3.5 stars, but I guess four will do. I've only used this for bottles, but for the most part, it's a great item. My baby is formula fed, so we make formula in the evening to use the next day and store it in the fridge. It heats up perfectly in the time it takes to change my daughter's diaper, but it took us a good while and a few steam-burned hands to figure out the right timing. The bottles can overheat VERY quickly, and watch out for the steam it creates... it's REALLY hot. The water measurement IS NOT hard... you simply fill up the side cup to the line and pour it in when you're ready to heat. We don't use the cooler much anymore, but when we kept my daughter's bassinet next to my bed, it was great for a quick reach instead of running out to the kitchen.",4
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,I purchased this bottle warmer for my second baby because it was a life saver for my daughter.  It stores 2 bottles in the compartment and comes with a small ice pack.  Do not store milk with this ice pack for more than eight hours.  The pack is fairly small and does not cool the milk for long.  I use a freezer pack and store one bottle at a time.  I would add a time chart just to know approximately how much time it takes to heat up a bottle.,4
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"Love this bottle warmer. I've been using it for 6 months now and it's great. I'm going to buy another for my mom's house. You do have to watch how much water you put in it. If there's too much, it will make the bottle too hot, but it comes with very easy instructions.I've never experienced any issues with it.",5
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"My wife and I decided, since we were having twins, to spend more on a bottle warmer than we did when our daughter was born.  We bought this bottle warmer, and we have found it to be unreliable, and, even, unsafe.  First, sometimes it cuts off for no reason, sometimes it will not even turn on.  Several times, the milk is scalding hot, so we have to wait minutes for the milk to get down to a drinkable temperature.  Take my advice - do not buy this product.  Warm water in the microwave, and warm your bottles that way.",1
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"The warmer is bulky and poorly designed, with awkward caps and measuring tubes that easily fall to the floor. After 7 months of never using the insulated compartment, I finally sawed the warmer in half and removed the entire back of the device. It's much improved -- fewer useless parts and takes up half the space.I would only buy this warmer again if I lived somewhere with no running water or refrigeration at night. If you make bottles in your kitchen, this is not the product for you. Find a smaller, cylinder-style warmer instead.",1
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"I bought it, very excited that it would be able to heat bottles quickly, keep them cool, and I could do this all in the comfort of my own room, instead of trotting to the kitchen.  It worked GREAT at first, but soon it stopped working so great.  A week later, it was taking up to TEN minutes to heat a bottle, when at first it only took about two to three.  To top it off, I was using Playtex vent aire bottles, and it melted the bottom!",2
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"we've got a 2 story and a 3 week old who wakes once or twice a night for formula.  I couldn't live without this bottle cooler/warmer!True, you must remember to freeze the ice pack - but easy enough, since you've got to clean up the used bottles each morning (just carry them all down together!).  And easy enough getting it all ready at night.Using it is a cinch, even in the dark. The amount of water/steam problem some other people have doesn't bother me - baby is fine with it as long as the chill is knocked off.I turn it on when I go into the room, then have time for a diaper change and the bottle's ready. PERFECTThis bottle warmer rocks!",5
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"We purchased this to use in our bedroom while our daughter is still in her bassinet.  It is wonderful for those middle of the night feedings.  We did not find it hard to use at all, and the bottles are pretty much always the same temeprature, and have never really been too hot or too cold.  We use the Avent bottles (which are great, by the way) and they fit in there fine.  She now (at 2 weeks) often sleeps through the night, so we don't need it quite so much anymore for nightime feedings, but we still use it during the day to warm her bottles.  It takes a few minutes to warm up the bottle, but I change her diaper while it is warming, and it seems to work out well.  And at least it shuts off by itself after the warming cycle is over . . . many other units do not.  The cooler is a wonderful feature as well . . . saves us from going to the kitchen in the middle of the night!!",5
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"If you are using standard sized bottles or the smaller (4 oz) Avent bottles, you will love this bottle warmer.  It's super easy to use and the storage area is perfect for those late night feedings.My only complaint is it doesn't hold the larger (9 oz) Avent bottles.  If you are using the Avent system, you may want to check out the Safety 1st version of this warmer (Dusk to Dawn) as it does support the larger Avent bottles.",5
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"I got this a a baby shower gift three years ago.  Used it even after baby slept through the nights for the early morning bottle.  The only problem is that you can only use traditional plastic bottles with this heater.  Not a problem for us though.  Had 2nd baby, still worked great.",5
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"I loved this product from the moment I got it. It works wonders with drop ins, And Avent bottles fit into and heat up nicely.... Sometimes that is. We have been using this with ourDr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcherand it was a life saver for awhile. Now All i can smell on our bottles is burnt milk from the heating plate.... Now I am not quite sure how the milk could possibly be getting onto it but it does apparently. We have been using it for about 3 months now almost every day, four- five times a day a most and it has considerably started to take longer and longer to heat up.. Before it was done and cooled off by the time the diaper change was over. Now we find ourselves sitting and waiting another minute or two for it to finish. The instructions are basically nonexistent. All in all it still works but I can slowly start to see it go down hill in its heating capabilities.",2
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"I bought this bottle warmer two months ago shortly after my baby was born, then all of a sudden for no reason it just stopped working.  The button you need to press to activate the warmer just didn't work anymore.  The one-year limited warranty states that the warmer need to be shipped back to them and they will decide at their option if they will replace it or repair it.  But what are you supposed to do in the meantime to heat bottles?  Save your money and buy a different warmer.",1
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"I received this item as a gift from my registry and I am pretty satisfied with it. The only time it overheated bottles was when I let the bottle sit there, past the timer's indicator light. Once that red light turns off, you need to remove the bottle, otherwise, the moisture that accumulates at the bottom of the bottle, will just drip onto the warmer itself, continuing to create steam...THUS, continuing to warm!!! (A word of advice for the makers of this product would be to make the button ring once it finishes warming bottles) Currently you hear the button pop back out, but if your baby is crying, you may miss this popping noise, and potentially overheat the bottle.The cooler part is very helpful, especially at night. Love the night-light. Read the instructions FULLY to get a better idea of what to expect with this warmer and for maintenance.",4
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,I recieved two of this bottle warmer for my baby showers.  The heating element on both burnt out within a month of use.  The second one smoked and caught fire causing a fire hazard.  Thank goodness I was in the room when it did this.  When it did work it was either too hot or too cold.  Sometimes when purchasing a product that doesn't work right you could say that you just got the bad one in the bunch but when two of the same product have the same problems I think it is poor manufacturing.  Save your money.  The bottle in the pan worked much better for me.,1
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"This was nice to have when I was pumping. I'd wake up in the middle of the night and heat up my daughter's bottle. Now that I'm formula feeding, it's not necessary.",3
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"I didn't register for a bottle warmer because I had heard so many people say they are a waste of money. I was heating the bottles by running hot water over them or putting them in a small pot on the stove and heating them up. These techniques would take forever while my baby screamed and cried. We also have a two story home with the bedrooms on the second floor so it was a real pain to have to come downstairs in the middle of the night to get a bottle ready and heat it up. So I decided to look for a bottle warmer.I bought this one because I also like that it has a compartment that keeps the bottles cool. It keeps them as chilled as if they were in the refrigerator, which is where I usually keep my bottles ( I make several up and then store them in the fridge throughout the day). This product also heats the bottles up much faster than the other ways I was doing before. I like this product so much that I'm now wanting to buy a second bottle warmer for downstairs but without the cooling compartment.The only downside is that you have to fill the vials with water, which is not a big deal, but it took a few test runs to figure out how much water to use to get the bottle warm enough. I just tested some bottles with cold water in them and tried different water amounts in the vials to figure it out. After that, this product was very easy to use and I would recommend it to anyone especially if you have a multi level home.",4
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"Great warmer, very convenient during the night feedings. I like that its silent, does not wake baby up at night. Highly recommend it.",5
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,I like this product since it had place your breastmilk in cold compartment however I dislike the measurements. You have to figure out  the measurements yourself,3
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,This really helped me during the first years of my baby.  This product is great!  The price is just right for the item.  It arrived on time and I really like the color too.  I will recommend this to my friends.,5
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"My daugher it 4 months old and I have never used this.  I use the powder formula and my sister in law taught me a quick trick.  I have a caddy beside the microwave that holds 3 water bottles (already filled) and 3 bottles with the formula already dispensed in them.  Heat the water for 20 seconds, dump it into the other bottle, shake and ready to go...30 second process.  But, I thought I would give this is a shot since it has just been sitting in my closet for 4 months.  So, I made up my 3 bottles, put them in the fridge.  After the first try, I couldn't wait until my last bottle was done...I HATE THIS PRODUCT.  It says for an 8 oz bottle to fill it to the top bar...so, even though she is only on 6 oz's, I still filled it to the top bar.  It wasn't anywhere near being warm.  So, the instructions said if it was too cold than to add more water. So, for the next bottle I filled that little capsule the entire way...still too cold.  So, both times I had to put it in the microwave for additional time.  So, the 3rd bottle I didn't even bother using the warmer...I went straight to the microwave.  Needless to say, I am back to the very easy and quick method of heating the water and mixing it with the formula and I'm done in 30 seconds.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",1
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"If this product is currently on your registry, remove it. If you received/purchased this item but have not opened it, return it. If you have opened this and thrown away the box, let this product follow the box to the landfill. (No, don't take it to Goodwill--why pass the problem on to someone else?)With two sequential runs of identical bottles (filled the same amount and removed from the same spot in the refrigerator after the same timeframe) and identical quantities of water, I got radically different results. The first bottle was spot on. The second bottle was like mammary magma. There is nothing more frustrating than trying to cool down a bottle while your boy wails.Now that you've done the sensible thing and rid your home of this inept uni-tasker, purchase a small, sensible crockpot, along the lines ofCrock-Pot 32041-C 16-Ounce Little Dipper, Chrome, and keep water warm in it overnight. Set a 4 oz. bottle in there for roughly 90 seconds, and it's ready. When baby is beyond bottle years, you still have a useful product.",1
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"I purchsed this product because of the cooling capabilities as it was perfect for night feedings instead of running downstairs to make a bottle in the middle of the night.  We loved it for the first month we had it.  BUT, after just about a month of use (warming 3 or 4 bottles per day) the warmer started over heating the bottles and sent milk pouring out of the top.  I use a variety of types of bottles and specifically the Dr. Browns and the First Years Breastflow bottles were overheated and thus overflowed in this warmer.  (The Advent bottles did not overflow but were so hot to the touch I couldn't take them out with my bare hands and thus was NOT going to put the bottle near my infant until it cooled down which tool 5 or more minutes.) We played with the amount of water we were using, thinking we were putting too much in (even though we were following the recommended water usage in the instructions).  That didn't help.  After having the product for less than 2 months we are returning it to the vendor where it was purchsed.  I would not recommend gettin this product.  First Years needs to go back to the drawing board on this one and come out with a product that actually works.",1
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"I liked this product until I heated a bottle for my son, then tested the milk first and found that it was hot enough to burn me.  Granted, I was making a 2 oz. bottle, which is all my son would drink at first, but there is no way to change the temperature for a bottle that is not 4 or 8 oz.  No matter the size, it takes several minutes to heat a bottle, which was way too long for my screaming baby in the middle of the night.  It was faster to run a bottle under warm water or to mix a new one using powdered formula and room temperature water.  I found this product to be mostly useless.",2
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,We bought this for warming milk at night.It is a hassle to measure water and put water in it in order to warm the milk.,1
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"Easy to use, cooler works well to store 2 bottles. I've been using it for 5 oz medela bottles so I pump at night, cap it and store it in the cooler and warm as I use it. Works great!",5
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,This was one of the best gifts because it was so easy to store bottles (and keep them cool) until I needed to heat them up at night.  Comes ready to use and was very easy to use also.,5
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,"This gadget was helpful in warming half finished bottles early on, but not so much after we bought a hot/cold water bottle stand. I never knew how much water to steam for the amount of liquid being warmed. I found it mor trouble and time consuming than it was worth.",2
The First Years Night and Day Bottle Warmer System,Do not buy for glass bottles. Says nothing about this on the website but on the box. Very dangerous because gets so hot,1
Avent ISIS Breast Pump with Disposable Nurser,"I was given an ISIS pump at my shower and used it a lot for the first 6 months after my baby girl was born. I loved it and had no complaints, until the neck on the largest part of the pump began to crack! I thought maybe I could have been a bit more careful, so I purchased a second one and was EXTRA careful. Now I need to pump daily because my baby eats cereal with my milk 3 times a day. It has only been TWO months and the SAME thing is happening. It is CLEARLY a major flaw in this product as many others have had the same problem.If anyone has ideas how to get the replacement part which I SHOULD BE GIVEN at this point let me know at utz@mindspring.com",2
Avent ISIS Breast Pump with Disposable Nurser,"Whether you go with disposable bottles or reusable, or use a both as I do, this is just the greatest pump!  I never expected a manual pump to work more quickly than my Medela mini electric, but it does, and since I'm not plugged in anywhere, I can pump anywhere--as a stay at home mom, that pretty much means in any room, but if you need to pump at work, this is lightweight, and most important, I'm sure, silent!  It can be done with one hand, and although at other sites others have claimed to pump with one hand while nursing at the other breast, I'm not quite that coordinated!  I'm sorry to hear someone had a problem with durability.  My daughter, now 2, nursed for a year, during which time this pump saw lots of use, and my son, 6 months, has just started solids, but I've used the pump for preparing milk for dad to feed him, and also when he was first born and had nursing problems, to relieve engorgement and to bottle feed.  Now I'm pumping to have milk to mix with his cereal.  Point is, I've found this pump to be VERY durable.  The other person whose pump cracked must have had the bad one of the lot.  I can most confidently recommend this pump, and anything else Avent puts out!",5
Avent ISIS Breast Pump with Disposable Nurser,"I received this as a gift at my baby shower. I had 2 pumps from the hospital and 1 pump from WIC. The Avent one is the one that I liked the best and I am still using it. It's small and easy to use. It's also nice because you can attach a bottle or the throw away containers, or use the collapsible liners it comes with. I don't have to pump a lot or often, so it has been perfect for me.",5
Avent ISIS Breast Pump with Disposable Nurser,"I had read about the Isis while I was pregnant and hoped it would work so well.  My husband was skeptical that a manual pump would work that well.  So, I got the pump with the disposable system so I could freeze the milk.  I started pumping at about 1 month and got 2 oz the first try.  Soon I was getting 4 oz in less than 10 min and still nursing regularly.  So, I had a stash in the freezer when I went back at 10 weeks - in addition to the milk we used trying to get my little girl to take the bottle.  She is taking it very well now - at 12 weeks she is using the #2 nipples and the 9 oz. bottles (she doesn't like the disposable bottles, so they just pour the milk into the bottle from the bag).  Now, I can pump about 4 oz. in the morning then nurse her and at work I take two breaks where I get at least 7 ozs in less than 10 min.  So, I am pumping what she eats each day (or more).  I try to push it a little to keep ahead.  The pump is so small, I just put it in a little tote bag and carry an insulated bottle bag for the milk (got that 'free' at the hospital).  I am so happy that she is still just getting breastmilk and we're still a few days ahead.  Its also wonderful that the system is interchangeable.  In the morning I pump into a regular bottle so her first bottle can be fresh.  That also works on the weekend.  I like to use the lids with the sealing disks to carry milk around in, the nipple lids leak sometimes.  I am interested in trying the soft sippy nipples with the bottle when she gets older.  Its just all working so well - Avent has really developed a great system.",5
Avent ISIS Breast Pump with Disposable Nurser,The soft silicone piece that fits on your breast making the pump comfortable is not replaceable.  You must buy an entirely new pump!  Kind of expensive.  The other parts are only available through the manufacturer.  The pump actually worked pretty well for the time I was able to use it.,1
Avent ISIS Breast Pump with Disposable Nurser,"This being my 4th baby, I have been through cylinder pumps, battery pumps, and other manual pumps--never happy with any of them.  I did purchase an expensive electric pump for my 3rd son; however, someone borrowed it, and they could not find it! The Isis pump doesn't ""hurt"" like other manual pumps, and it is a breeze to set up!  I cannot use the ""pedal"" that comes with the pump; it reduced the suction I needed to get my flow going.  My electric pump was eventually found and returned, but to tell the truth, it is collecting dust! I am very happy with the Isis and recommend it highly.",5
Avent ISIS Breast Pump with Disposable Nurser,"I bought this pump while I was pregnant with my first baby because the price was great. I didn't know the Avent name at the time, but now it's the only one I would use along with all the bottles and sippy cups! I recommend this to everyone of my friends having babies. It is comfortable and easy to use for a manual pump. This was the first pump I bought so I didn't have to go through a bunch of expensive hard to use pumps. I've never used an electric pump so I don't know how it compares, but people I've talked to say this is much better than a lot of the electric pumps on the market. I was very happy with this one and it met all my needs. I could pump 5-10 ounces in less than 5 minutes. All the pieces come apart very easily for washing and go back together easily as well. It travels well too!Great Great item!!! I'll be using it again in a month when my second baby arrives!",5
Avent ISIS Breast Pump with Disposable Nurser,"I bought this  pump after reading all the wonderful reviews. It works OK, but it hurts my nipples every time I pump. I probably should not complain since it's the only pump with cilicone cup, so the other ones must be much worse and more painful. I also didn't like the disposable liners. After using Playtex disposables, Avent liners are just a joke. So when I ran out of liners, I just bought regular Avent bottle that fits the pump. It's much more convienient than disposable nurser. I would still recomend this pump, not because I like it, but because there is nothing better on the market right now.",3
Avent ISIS Breast Pump with Disposable Nurser,"I have never reviewed a product online before, however I am so frustrated with Avent that I feel it is important for other mothers to know about my current troubles.  I have been rather pleased with this product.  It is not quiet as advertised, but nothing a little hand cream could not fix.  It is also easy to forget and lose many of the parts involved.  When even the tiniest part is missing the pump will not work.  I am a working mother trying to continue breastfeeding my son until at least one year of age.  It is important to have a pump with me while at work and my electric pump is not a realist option.  I have recently lost the small white disk necessary for the pump to function and immediately went to some local stores to purchase replacements.  Only to find out that you can only purchase parts directly through Avent and after reading reviews I am not feeling confident that I will have my replacement parts anytime soon.  For a company that claims to support breastfeeding, I feel they do not make it as easy as they state.  When purchasing this pump stock up on replacement parts so you are not inconvenienced as I am now...for who knows how long.",3
Avent ISIS Breast Pump with Disposable Nurser,"With 11 years between my two kids, a lot has changed to say the least.  I think the biggest difference (well, besides that whole ""sleep on the back thing"") is the breast pump.My other experiences with breast pumps involved pain, lots of time, or undue expense.  I find the Avent pump to be quick, efficient, and best of all, pain free.  This pump is a marvel  of ""why didn't I think of that"" technology.First of all, it's cheap.  You really can't beat the price, especially if , like me, you only want it for occaisional use.  The let-down massage cushion is very soft, and easy on those tender breasts.  I know you hear me on that one, girls. I find that I can express both breasts in about 15 minutes.  It is even easy on my hand!  I thought I would be pumping the thing like crazy and working up a nice case of carpal tunnel, but once I begin to pump, I find that I can just hold it in the ""closed position"" and I continue to express.  It is super easy to disassemble and clean as well.Breastfeeding is a wonderful.  This just makes it easier.",5
Avent ISIS Breast Pump with Disposable Nurser,"MY NIPPLES CRACKED SHORTLY AFTER BIRTH BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET MY CHILD TO LATCH ON THE RIGHT WAY. BUT I STIKK WANTED TO BERASRTFEED AS LONG AS I COULD. SO I WENT TO THE STORE AND PURCHASED THIS PUMP. IT WAS THE CHEAPEST AND IT WORKED GREAT. ON THE FIRST TRY, I WAS ABLE TO COLLECT 10 OUNCES IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES.I ALSO LOVE THE CARRYING CASE THAT IT COMES WITH, VERY DESCREET.",5
Avent ISIS Breast Pump with Disposable Nurser,"This is an outstanding breast pump.  Easy to assemble, use and clean.  Just be careful not to overtighten the pump body to the bottle adapter when you put it together.  If you do, the pump body will crack and you must replace the entire pump.  This is listed in the directions but not stressed enough.",4
Avent ISIS Breast Pump with Disposable Nurser,"I have gotten breast pumps in the past, and did not like them becasue they hurt and did not work at all.

Delta Children's Products Vintage Chic Jenny Lind Changing Table in Oak,I bought this for my son. I thought it was a good product for a fair price. He has been using it for the past 8 months with no problems. But just yesterday I saw a sticker on the side of the strap that said the table had a 20 lb weight limit! I was surprised. My son almost weighs that and I don't want to buy another table now. Next time I will buy a more substantial one for more money that can be used longer.,3
Delta Children's Products Vintage Chic Jenny Lind Changing Table in Oak,"I love this changing table. This changing table has lots of space for keeping babies things handy.  You can put everything you need like diapers, rash ointment, powder, wipes tee shirts ,burp cloths on one of the shelves and still have room for a few toys. It has ample room to change and dress the baby without any problems.  You may want to get a thicker changing pad though. I have never had a problem with this and I used it for two kids.",4
Delta Children's Products Vintage Chic Jenny Lind Changing Table in Oak,"This changing table is better used on smaller babies. As the instructions point out, the weight limit is 20 pounds. That limits the time you can safely use this item. Our daughter is 27 pounds now and we're still using it but we often use the bed instead. This table works well for storing diaper supplies if you're concerned about baby's weight and safety but it is not a sturdy piece of furniture. The screws loosen periodically and need to be monitored for tightening. We have the same problem with a moderately priced baby glider. Spend the extra money on a better quality changing table if you plan to use it a long time.",3
Delta Children's Products Vintage Chic Jenny Lind Changing Table in Oak,"I haven't had any problems w/ this changing table.  I saw no reason to spend a lot of money for a changing table, but I wanted something durable.  Yes, the shelves won't hold the Encyclopedia Britannica set, but it holds my supplies nicely  (I keep stuff in baskets for organizational purposes).  I have used this for over 2 years w/ no screws loosening or other issues.  I have never used the belt that comes w/ it, so I can't speak to that.  I did purchase padded changing pad covers to make that part more comfortable for my son.",4
Delta Children's Products Vintage Chic Jenny Lind Changing Table in Oak,"I received this dressing table as a shower gift, and I was very impressed with the woodwork design.  I placed it on my registry without ever seeing it and I must say it looks much nicer in person.  I haven't even installed the safety brackets underneath to protect it from the weight and it managed to hold up all of her clothes and baby supplies without buckling!  I wasn't sure how it would look considering I have all cherry wood furnishings, but I honestly must say I am impressed at how well it looks together, and I would purchase this again!  The downside to this changing table was putting it together by the instructions.  I highly suggest you try other alternatives to the instruction guidelines!  Other than that this is a wonderful changing table.",4
Delta Children's Products Vintage Chic Jenny Lind Changing Table in Oak,"I'm very surprised they haven't updated the model.. but looking through these reviews, I can see that they haven't changed a thing.This changing table was terribly unsturdy. I was CONSTANTLY tightening screws. Let me also mention that the whole thing collapsed before my son was even 8 months old. The cheaply made wood contributed greatly to this problem. Thankfully, my son wasn't hurt.I would caution anyone against using this product, until the company makes a sturdier model, with heavier wood.Looks nice, but that's about it.",1
Delta Children's Products Vintage Chic Jenny Lind Changing Table in Oak,"This is a good solid dressing table.  We received it because my in-laws found it at a consignment shop, so I can't comment about other reviewers' concerns regarding assembly.  The table serves the purpose and is a good value for those who don't want to spend a lot of money on a dressing table.  We didn't feel that we needed a fancy dressing table and instead opted to purchase a more expensive crib, which is really the focal point of the nursery.  The dressing table has two shelves that are quite convenient for holding supplies.  I placed baskets on those shelves to hold diapers, etc.",4
Delta Children's Products Vintage Chic Jenny Lind Changing Table in Oak,"This changing table MIGHT last for awhile, but the shelves are made out of cheap fiber board and do not hold much weight.  The frame is nice for the price, but they really need to consider using something a little heavier and nicer for the shelves.  They also don't have very good instructions for putting it together.  It is confusing.  Overall it will do, but we were disappointed with the quality.  They obviously used the cheapest materials available.",3
Delta Children's Products Vintage Chic Jenny Lind Changing Table in Oak,"I think this is a gret product for a good price.  It was easy to put together.  I didn't even use the directions, just looked at the box.  I love the storage underneath, it helps to keep everything organized.  Very sturdy.  The only bad thing i can say is that the baby will get his hands and feet in between the rungs so be careful when you go to pick them up.  Other than that, I would highly reccomend this product",5

I run a licensed group daycare home (12 kids) and this thing has been great!  You should see all the stuff we have on it, in the middle shelf we have 6 infant spaces with diapers stacked near the front and the spare clothes for each of these kids behind it.  The bottom shelf has the same but only one or two kids and the rest of the space is all used for spare clothes for the kids.  We also have some pretty big kids using it, the 2 1/2 year olds get changed there every single day and the screws never needed to be tightened.  Like I said, we have a daycare, we change 4 infants and 4 toddlers every weekday here and never a problem.Anyway, I will definately be purchasing one for my little baby due in May with all the confidence in the world.  I don't condone all the Jenny Lind products though, the crib is great too especially for the money but the cradle didnt last long at all.  I did have a BIG problem with that one comming loose all the time and tipping.Trisha",5
UltraSoft Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,I love it.  It is very soft.  It fits snug on the mattress and won't slip off.  A nurse in my hospital said mattress pads are safe as long as they stay on.  I have no complaints.,5
UltraSoft Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"I have been using the Ultrasoft Crib Matress Pad and it has saved me from all sorts of messes. It is absorbent and holds up to many, and I mean many, washings.",5
UltraSoft Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"This is the best mattress pad I've seen yet!  It is thick, soft, washes beautifully but best of all it fits the crib mattress perfectly without having to pull and tug on it trying to get it to fit only to have one of the corners pop off anyway.  I highly recommend this. I wish I'd had this from the start.",5
UltraSoft Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"No, it's not a glamorous item, cute or pretty- but a top notch quaility item that will last thru many washings and can go on to be used on a toddler bed. I love mine. Just an update- 2 years later and still going strong on my little ones toddler bed.",5
UltraSoft Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"I put this on my baby's mattress and, man, she has the cushi-est little bed a baby can safely have!  It's not too soft so that I'm worried about a possible SIDS risk, yet it's not hard as a rock either.  Washes well, and comes off and goes back on the bed easily.  I'm not sure about other reviews that said it had issues with &quot;melting&quot; together in the dryer or whatever...because I've never had a problem.  Just follow the washing instructions and you'll be fine.  It's a great addition to your baby's crib!",5
UltraSoft Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,This was an excellent buy for my 6 month old. It adds a thin layer of cushion but not too much that it becomes a safety hazard. It fits a standard crib mattress perfectly. It fits great under the fitted sheet and was easy to wash after a diaper malfunction. Use low heat to dry. I wish I would have bought it sooner!**I would use caution if buying for a newborn. I would not use it until your baby is able to roll over easily. Although the cushion is thin I would be scared of pooling by the mouth if your baby were to spit up.,5
UltraSoft Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"I received this item as a shower gift.  I did follow the directions to wash it and it washed up beautifully.  It seems very plush on top, covers the mattress tightly and appears to adequately repel liquids.  This will also make the bed very comfortable for my baby that is due soon.  I definitely recommend buying this item.",5
UltraSoft Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,I was looking for a thick mattress pad since my daughter wants a softer bed and this wasn't going to help. I ended up ordering a foam topper. This seems to be a great quality mattress pad/cover if that's what you need.,4
UltraSoft Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"I purchased this pad with the BRU Sealy UltraSoft Mattress ($59.99 avail. online)and I couldn't be happier.  I was nervous about the whole crib and bedding purchase b/c of so many different reviews, but I have to say I'm happy I got it right the first time.  The softness of the pad evens out the firmness of the mattress and it's a comfortable bed that I would love to sleep on.  The mattress fits perfectly without the pad and even better with the pad (for overprotective moms who want no finger room between the crib and mattress).  The sheets for her room theme also fit like a glove.  My 9 month old daughter is transitioning out of her bassinet and I have to sneak her in the crib b/c she's not yet used to the extra space, but the first time she slept until 8am and her normal arise time is 6:30-7am.  I am a happier mom with this purchase.",5
UltraSoft Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"I own two of these mattress pads and I love them.  They help to make my extremely firm crib mattress a little cozier for my son.  They hold up very well in the wash and fit great over my Simmons mattress.  It is a little more expensive that other mattress pads, but in my opinion it is worth it.",5
UltraSoft Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,I specifically bought this matress cover because our Babee Tenda matress is longer than the standard matress and all the reviews said it was too large for a standard crib matress.  It fits our babee tenda matress perfectly!  We LOVE IT!!,5
UltraSoft Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"Unlike many other pads on the market, this one is very soft and durable. It holds up great to washing, fits my baby's mattress perfectly, and appears to be very cozy for my little one.",5
Fisher-price Super-sensitive Nursey Monitor,"I got this monitor handed down to me from a relative who kept it with her kids(now 3&amp;4).She told me that its only default was eating batteries.I take it 50 feet away without any squeeling sounds.I use it to go on the porch to make phone calls on a cordless with no problem.It is so sensative that if Im in the bedroom I can hear floor creaks in the livingroom.I noticed that if there is any interfearence like planes or fuzz a new battery fixes it back to normol.I would like it better if it came with a plug for both ends.Since I didnt buy it,maybe it did.Well,the fact that anything lasted over 3 years in my family makes it super dourable.",4
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set,This is a great product for both Non-breastfed and breastfed (suggest use after about a month so baby is used to nursing and milk supply is established) babies. This unique system works best for eliminating excessive air from the bottle therefore preventing excessive gas! The nipples are a little larger than some babies may prefer but are closer to the breast than most other bottles. Without a doubt my favorite bottle for our son and we will be sure to use it with our next child!,5
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set,We were using the single feeding bottles we got from the hospital and noticed how much air the baby was getting from the bubbles forming in the bottle during feedings. We also had a hard time getting her to eat more and she was starting to lose weight. We switched over to the Playtex system after a recommendation from our sister-in-law and we have had a lot less problems w/gassiness occuring during feedings. The drop-in liners are easier to use than the other liners and seem to measure out better than the other liners as well. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is thinking of bottle feeding their baby.,4
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set,"MY SON IS NOW 9 WEEKS OLD, AND WE HAVE TRIED ALMOST ALL THE BOTTLES ON THE MARKET.  THE PLAYTEX BOTTLES ARE THE BEST.  THEY ARE SO EASY TO USE AND CLEAN.  MY HUSBAND EVEN AGREES!  BEFORE USING THE PLAYTEX, WE HAD THE DR BROWNS BOTTLES.  THESE WORKED ALSO VERY WELL,BUT THE ONLY COMPLAINT WE HAD WAS THE EXTRA TIME NEEDED TO CLEAN EVEY LITTLE PART OF THE VENTING SYSTEM.  MY HUSBAND AND I COULD NOT DEAL WITH THEM ANY MORE, AND TOOK THE ADVICE FROM MY MOTHER WHO SUGESTED THE PLAYTEX FROM THE START.  I PERSONALLY LIKE THE ORIGINAL NURSER BECAUSE OF THE PLASTIC IT'S MADE WITH.  THE NEW PREMIUM BOTTLE  SEEMS TO HAVE SHARP EDGES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOTTLE.  WE ARE SO HAPPY WITH THESE NEW BOTTLES AND MY SON IS DOING WELL WITH THE CHANGE, WE HAVE NO COMPAINTS WITH THIS BOTTLE.",5
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set,"since my 1st child to my new grandson, I do not remember ever having a bottle be more easy on the stomach and prevent colic.Even my colicky babydid the very best when I used these. Nothing else has ever done better and these are less hassle in the cleaning area and while you have to keep buying the inserts,they are affordable,I bought the others but they are just ideasMD's helped develop, doesn't mean they work as well, 'cuz they don't!!!I'd go with Playtex every time.",5
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set,My 6 week old hated bottles until these came in. He had his choice of 5 nipples and likes the latex slow flow the best. Even my husband is able to feed him with ease (breastfed babies are picky!). I love how easily I can store unfinished breast milk. I recommend this to everyone. It would make a great Baby Shower present!,5
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set,"My baby is still breastfed and began daycare last week.  These are the bottles my mom fed me with and I knew from the beginning that I wanted to use these with my children.  From the very first bottle she had, my daughter took the bottle well and now easily switches between breast and bottle.  In addition, there is a wide variety of nipples to choose from so you can find one that your baby will like.",5
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set,"I was mistaken when I registered for these bottles... I thought I could use everything in the box for my baby when she was born.  However, I did not realize (being a new mom) that this was a sample kit with various nipples (one of each) for older and newer babies, teething babies, nipples that helped encourage latching of the breast and nipples that just plain resembled the breast.I actually would recommend that if you're a first time mom, register for this box and also pick out (seperately) two 4 oz bottles with 'slow-flow silicone' nipples for younger babies and two 4 oz bottles with 'slow-flow rubber' nipples for younger babies.First test the silicone on your little one and if your baby does not like it, does not latch on well or has a problem with silicone, try her on the rubber nipples.  After that, you'll know which nipples your baby will need and can purchase more *nipples* to go with the rest of the bottles in your kit.I would suggest you do not use the nipples that come with the kit at all... new babies should either be on silicone or rubber slow-flow nipples for younger babies.  Once you've found the typle of material he/she prefers - stick with it.  And around the age of 4-6 months, switch them to older baby nipples in that same material.Hope this review helps you!  Good luck with your little one.  :)",4
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set,"My son drank from a regular bottle for one feeding (and nursing for all other feedings) very easily till he was around 3 months old. And then, all of a sudden, he seemed to prefer the nursings. This bottle solved that problem! He took to it very easily..and for busy moms,the liners are great..I don't have to run the dishwasher every night! We used the brown natural latch nipple.",5
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set,"I am a breastfeeding mom, and I tried and tried to get my baby to take a bottle - I tried every brand. She finally did take the Playtex orthondontic nipple.  HOWEVER, the way her lips formed around the nipple caused her bottom lip to curl up under it, and anyone who is an experienced breastfeeder knows that in order to have a good latch-on at the breast, your baby's bottom lip needs to curl OUT, not in.  This in turn caused me to have sore nipples when I was nursing her. There is nothing you can do to change how a baby sucks on a Playtex nipple; that is how they are designed.  It has taken taken considerable effort to reteach her how to latch-on, and even now (after four months) she still occasionally will turn in her bottom lip while she is nursing.  (I introduced this bottle at FIVE months, and she had always had a good latch-on from day one.)  I highly recommend (if you are a breastfeeding mother and wish to supplement, for example) using Avent - the nipple is shaped like your natural nipple and is designed to simulate nursing.  (OR use the new Playtex soft-shaped silicone nipples - they seem to be shaped the same way.)  Bottom line - if you still want to breastfeed and do not want sore nipples, you may not want to use this bottle system (at least the nipples).",2
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set,I've used these bottles since my sons were born.-I love the fact that they are extremely easy to clean and the liners are very convenient. (but are getting expensive.) I would use these bottles up until you need to make 8oz of formula. *If you use powder formula - the drop-in liners DO NOT hold 8oz of water and the formula you add to it!! I had a mess of formula everywhere!!!,3
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set,The box the bottles came in got damaged during shipping and the box was open. I got these bottles for my sister-in-law who is having a baby in a couple of weeks.  We read the different reviews and I think these bottles fit the needs of most newborns. The ability to get all the air out of the disposable bag and throw the disposable bag away after using is great!,4
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set,"I breastfeed my son and recently started supplementing with bottles.  My mother highly recommended the Playtex Nursers (that's all she ever used) and bought me this set after I had terrible luck with some other bottles.  My breastfed baby readily took this bottle with virtually no fussing (and less burping, gas and spitting up).  After experimenting with the other nipple shapes I found that my son prefers the regular shaped nipple, but I liked that I could try them all out with one purchase.  I've recently bought some extra Older Baby nipples, and of course, liners, but other than that, this set has provided me with more than enough ""equipment"" and I'm sure it's the only set of bottles I'll need.",5
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set,"Not only have I used these, but so has my mother. The babies love them, . . . all 6 of them. plus the babies ( 3) that I watch also love them. Theses really are one of the BEST bottles out there.",5
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set,"I put this set in my registry because these particular bottles have a good reputation.And, believe me, my son loves it!It especially came in handy when I discovered that when my son came out of the hospital, he started to choke on regular nipples.These don't go down his throat as much, so I can definately avoid choking.You can also take the air out of the bags, so it takes away most of the gas.",4
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set,"Last year, in preparation to our son's arrival, we bought several leading, what I will call ""bottle feeding systems"" (You are not buying just bottles, but also committing yourself to the accessories specific to that brand, so they are systems).  The ones we chose to try were:-Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle-Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Bottles- ThesePlaytex, although in concept very appealing, we did not like because due to their design/material it is hard to get out all of the milk and so some of it always gets wasted.  Also, it is very challenging to measure out exact amounts as the numbers and gradations on the dropins is hard to see.  We stopped using these very quickly.  Although, if you are using formula that is less viscous than milk, these might be work much better.  Plus, Target sells a store version of dropins which a lot of people like, so that helps a lot with the price.Avent bottles are generally very good, and we ended up using them a lot.  Also, we purchased the ridiculesly overpricedPhilips AVENT BPA Free Standard Breast Pump Conversion Kitto be able to use the bottles withMedela Pump in Style Advanced Breast Pump.  The setup works great.  The main problem with the Avent bottles is that if you forget to put in the little ring, the milk will leak all over your child. With the ring in, we never had a leak. We have used both the larger and smaller bottles and nipples N-4, and the above comments apply to all variations.Dr. Brown's bottles are probably the best out of the three.  Like the Avent, we have used both the larger and smaller bottles and nipples 1-4.  With its design, it is harder to assemble the bottle without all the necessary pieces.  We have never had these bottles leak.  The complaints that they are hard to wash are unfounded.  We never had an issue with just throwing them in the dishwasher.  After about nine months of use, some of the markings are slightly coming off, not a big deal.  Also, the number of parts (6 vs Avent's 5 counting the lid) is not as overwhelming as some people on here claim.There seem to be no difference in any of the above bottles when it came to reducing gas.  All of them reduced some, but not all.  Likewise, our son had no preference in the nipples from one bottle to the next among these, although he absolutely hatedThe First Years 3 Pack Breastflow Bottle, so we only tried it once.If I had to pick only one of the above brands, it would be Dr. Brown's.",4
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set,"I knew I wanted to use these bottles, but didn't know much else about them.  I remembered using these bottles for my brothers and sisters, so I figured they have stood the test of time.  This was a great way for me to try the different selections.  I really recommend the bottles with the slides on the side to let out the air.  Everyone who sees me using it thinks they are great.  We have had no problems with the baby getting too much air.  She burps for us at every feeding.  She is 2 months old so they have gotten a lot of use already.",5
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set,"While I was pregnant I had heard about these bottles and that they were essentials for breastfeeding moms. I, thinking they weren't ""as pretty"" as other bottles decided to get something else. I tried everything and my baby girl was just not having. I was nearly in tears thinking about going back to work and that my baby would not be able to eat. I spent hours a day trying to get her to eat with other bottles and was so frustrated, worn out, and emotional.I finally got these, and honestly, I couldn't wait to get home to wash them and try them out. I held my breath and gave it a go..I couldn't believe my eyes, not only was she not screaming bloody murder, she loved them. She ate four ounces right then.My advice to all pregnant and nursing moms is GET THIS. Don't delay. Try to introduce a bottle early on (around 4 weeks) and get these because they work. My baby girl loves the latex nipple because it is soft like the breast.If you google coupons for Playtex you can find them all over. I used a $2 off coupon I got from ""liking"" Playtex Drop Ins on facebook and then waited for a sale at Babies R Us (30% off)  and ended up getting this set for about $11, but honestly, I probably would have paid over $100 for them that's how amazing they are!!",5
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set,"I started using these bottles with my daughter 4 years ago and now I am using them for my son. Both of my kids loved them, never had any spit up or gas problems. Both kids were breastfed but I gave them formula once a day. They never had any problem switching from breast to bottle. I tried avent bottle with my son but he started spitting up. The only reason why I tried Avent was that my son needs more than 8OZ -:) so it is small for him! All in all very happy.",5
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set,This kit has everything you need to start your baby off on disposable bottles. Assorted sizes and nipples that give you and your baby a great variety.,4
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set,"I also tried the Avent brand bottles which were given to me as a shower gift, but I was disappointed because they leaked. At a friends suggestion, I tried the playtex disposables and love them. My son is 4 weeks old and has no problem at all with these bottles. The natural style clear silicone 'slow flow' nipple seems to work best for him and I like that you can release air from the disposable liners before feeding. I have had no trouble at all with these bottles leaking. As a first time mom, I am very pleased and confident with this product. Highly recommend!",5
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser Newborn Starter Set,"I love that you can pump, freeze and feed all from the same liner.  You have to buy the Playtex pump adapter kit to be able to do that but I think its still much cheaper than using milk storage bags.  Clean up couldn't be easier either, just throw it away.  That feature is great when traveling as well. You don't have to worry about your bottles not being clean because you use a fresh liner and the milk stays there until baby gets it, not getting transferred around from bottle to bag to bottle again.  I also liked that the liner was able to collapse on itself and didn't for a vacuum for baby to fight against like some bottles do.  I did have a few issues with the bottles leaking if they weren't screwed on just right but I think that happens if any bottle isn't screwed on right.  Bottom line is my Huband and I loved the Playtex system for breastmilk feeding/storage and we still use it now that we switched to formula at 9 months.",5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"I bought this gate after reading all of the positive reviews. I have to agree, I really like it! It was easy to put together (despite not having instructions) and it feels very stable. Also, measure your space very carefully. I measured wrong and had to order an extra extension. In total, I have the main gate plus three 24"" extensions.",5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"We've had the basic gate setup for over 5 years now and it is holding up beautifully.  Our only want for it during that time has been an automatic closing mechanism.  Bungee cords will work, but are less than ideal for that since they are a tad unsightly and somebody still needs to latch it.  Aside from that lone issue however, nothing has become loose, noticeably worn, or broken in that time.  It has stood up well to thousands of open-close cycles and has been terrific for controlling access for our dogs, as well as for corralling our now 4 year old son who has been able to open it since he was about 3.This has been an outstanding value for us and I would definitely choose it again.",5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"I absolutely love this gate!!! It is safe, study and easy to opporate. It is the only gate that would sucessfully block off a hallway in my house. It is well worth the money. I wasted my money on many other cheaper gates before buying this one.",5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"This is a great gate for making any area off-limits to babies and toddlers.  It is especially good for low-traffic areas, such as surrounding a fireplace.  If using it in a higher-traffic area, be aware that there is a small base that you will need to step over (you can see what I mean in the picture).  The three segments plus optional extra segments can be positioned to fit any angle imaginable.  The gate itself is very easy to use, but not so easy that your little ones will be able to open it on their own.  Not only is it easy to install, but it is also easy to take down and reinstall if necessary.  I've tried the cheaper models, and it is worth paying a little more to get this one.",5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"I have two of these gates. The first is great, the second (which I bought from Amazon) is noticeably less well made. The gate will not stay open, and unlike the other gate (same model number), the door latches only at the top, not at top and bottom. It's thus much less secure. It also doesn't shut properly - the latch doesn't engage unless you push down on the gate.",2
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"We needed a gate for a really wide space between our family room and kitchen and this gate works perfectly.  It doesn't look terribly cheesy.  The gate is easy to open and close, but not so easy that our toddler can figure it out.",5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,I have an area that is unusually hard to fit for a baby gate. This is the only gate that would work for me! You really can bend each little 2 foot section any which way to fit your needs. The gate part is easy enough for my older kids but also difficult enough for the little ones to stay put. I would've been lost without this gate!,5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,Fairly Easy to install. Nice and sturdy. Perfect for our wide area. You can even take the gate down conveniently if you don't need it up at all times. It just slips right into the grooves (hardware) that is installed into the wall. We are very pleased with this gate! I would recommend this product to everyone!,5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,This is a great gate.  We were looking for a gate to go around our fireplace as soon as our son started to crawl.  We researched numerous gates and found this one to be the best.  It is fairly easy to install and is very sturdy.  It is very easy to open the gate.  We had to buy the 24 inch extension to add to the gate and this was easy to install as well.  What I really liked about this was the fact the mounting for the gate is set up a little higher on the wall.  This makes is much easier to install as you dont have to worry about the baseboards. We have two other gates on our stairs and in each of these you had to deal with the baseboard because of the low mounts.,5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"I love this gate.  We live in a town house, and the wall next to our staircase doesn't have any studs in it, and the stairs would move from a pressured gate.  The front door is also located in front of the stairs, so we wanted a gate that would block access to the stairs, and also block the front door so I wouldn't have to worry about my son getting in front of the door incase daddy walked in.  It is very sturdy and strong.  It is much stronger when you have the gate curved rather then straight.  I would highly recommend this gate for anyone stuck in a fickle with dimensions.",5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,We bought two different kinds of Gates for our living room area.  We bought the Kidco Configure gate and the Kidco Elongate.The elongate was to cover an area of 84"".  The elongate can only go straight across and opening.  It's extension are screwed together and have an overlap. So the gate is not actually straight across.  We are very disappointed in this purchase and wished we had bought two Configure gates.  Took us some time to screw the extension in and then to screw the supports in and then to mark it on the wall.  Took us over an hour.The Configure gate is on the pricey side.  We almost did not buy it.  But it has two different size extension pieces and you can bend and configure it to the space you need.  We use it at the bottom of our stairs and it bows out to give you an area so that the gate is not up against the stairs.It was so easy to add the extension piece on.  You just snap out the pole and add the extension piece.  You can bend the gate different ways to fit in the opening.To Mount on the wall you just mark the screw holes and screw in the plate then snap the gate on.  It was mounted on the wall in less then 20 minutes.  It was very sturdy.I highly recommend this gate.,5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"Previously, we were using a wide gate from Evenflow to block the 64"" entry into our kitchen from our mudroom.  The Evenflow gate had a plastic block that served to stabilize the pivot point at which the gate opened.  It had cheesey rubber feet on the bottom that never actually kept the thing from sliding, so we changed to this gate.Wow.  Unbelievably solid.  It was expensive, but I'm glad we changed to this one.My only 2 quibbles with this are the fact that it's only adjustable to a point (some gates have a slide & screw method to make an exact fit) and you cannot mount the entry gate at an end - it MUST be in the middle, or if you get extenders, just not at one of the ends.",5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,This is the first gate the actually accomodates our irregular stairway.  It is adjustable and so versatile.  It is sturdy enough that I haven't even mounted it to the walls.  I absolutely recommend this gate.  I wish I had known about it with my oldest daughter.,5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"you get what you pay for in price and lemme tell you it's amazing!!! BUY IT! you wont regret it...need a simple gate for stairs, or one for a fireplace, large opening, work out area like a treadmill or entertaiment center this thing works for anything!",5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"I love this gate!  I cannot stress enough how wonderful this gate is, and it's worth every penny!  We had purchased the Safe and Secure gate, because it fit our opening and was $80 cheaper than the Configure Gate, it was such junk that we ended up returning it and spending the extra $$ for the configure gate.  It is easy to install, and easy to open and close.  This is the best gate out there!",5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"...of this gate.  We were a little skeptical about it at first, as with anything we buy online, but it has been awesome.  It's a very sturdy gate with easy mechanics.  Very simple.  We bought for the top of our extra-wide stairway 5 minutes after our 7-month-old took his first tumble.  We are so much more relaxed now because we know the gate will keep him safe.  It's more attractive than we had anticipated.  As for the quality...it's very sturdy and easy to install if you have studs in the right places and a power drill.  My guess is that those who rated it poorly either installed it wrong or didn't attach it to studs.  Great product.  Worth every penny.",5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"We use one of these at the top of our stairs, and one at the bottom.  We have a wrought iron railing and this goes all the way around it.  It is phenomenal.",5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"The Kidco gate is wonderful.  As many others, I was hesitant in spending a lot of money on a gate.  My son however knocked down everything else.  We purchased the gate and were so suprised at how well it worked.  Very easy to install and very easy to use.",5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,This product would be very helpful but the bars are bent and the the angles that are not attached to the wall are not sturdy.  We wanted it to be a secure gate that would keep our son from falling down the stairs.  We will keep it because it is better than nothing but we will still have to watch him closely so that he doesn't push it down and fall.,3
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,I was pleasantly surprised by the construction of the bars and the hinges of this gate.  The coating on the metal is very nice to the touch.  The wall attaching mechanism is easy to figure out.  I only wish they had suggested that drywall anchors might be needed to secure this to the wall.  I also bought the black fireplace gate (also by Kidco) and am very pleased with that too.  My 9-month old enjoys standing up holding on to the bars and it has made life so much easier now that she can't get into certain hazards on the other side of the gate.  My only complaint would be that adjusting the hinges between sections is moderately painful to my hand but this is only necessary to do while setting up the position of the fence and not a daily problem.  The gate opening mechanism is a great design.,5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,Installing them together was pretty tough but I manage somehow to mount them on the wall.,4
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"I purchased a ConfigurGate that is now outside of warranty. They no longer sell replacement parts for a poorly designed plastic part that supports the gate near the hinge point.  Instead, they offered to sell me a new door for almost $100 (Price gouging) whereas the retail price on a whole new gate is not much more. It is probably about a 50 cent part that is broken.  Based on poor design and lack of parts support, I would not buy another product from KidCo.",1
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"This is very sturdy and the door that swings both ways is such a nice feature.  I cannot say enough good things about this gate!  We have a open floorplan in our home and this gate is about the only one that would fit the large opening in our entryway.  This was able to withstand everything my triplet daughters did to it for the last 3 years, and is none worse for the wear.  I would highly recommend this gate to anyone, it is worth every penny!!",5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,This is the best baby gate ever!  We initially bought it over 2 years ago for my son to block off a large hallway...this gate was the only one big enough for the hallway.  It is VERY simple to install.  Now we have it in a different house for our second son.  My now 3 year old can open it by himself (which we wanted).  It was simple to bring with us on the move and easy to install again.  I recommend this gate to ANYONE who is looking for a gate for large openings!  We had MANY compliments from friends (who are also parents) about our gate after they had been at our house and used it.  Don't pick any others!  This one is it!,5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,Got this 2 1/2 months back when my son was 9 months old. Its still holding up to his constant abuse - which happens everyday now. He likes to step up to it and rattle it like crazy :) but the gate doesn't seem to budge at all. Have 2 of these. This will continue to be useful as we're planning to get a dog soon. Highly recommended for kids and pets.,5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"I purchased this along with another 24"" and an 8"" extension and used it to corner off our TV stand.  Originally my husband was not into having a baby get in front of the TV because it might obstruct the bottom of the TV screen, but it didn't.  The gate latches easily for us to access the game consoles, but not for our little boy to get into.  The wall mounting was easy to install and very secure, and if you need to remove the gate, the gate detaches from the mounting with ease.  Unlike many other baby gates, the kids can't climb this one as fast because of the direction of the tubes and there are no ledges for them to step on.",5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"I run an in-home daycare in a townhouse in addition to having my own young children.This gate is by FAR the sturdiest gate I've used and it is my absolute favorite.  I have 4 different baby gates.  We used it in a previous home to surround the fireplace but have it in use for keeping children in the playroom across a large doorway now.The gate is attractive, too!  I don't feel like I'm keeping the children ""trapped"" like with other gates.My only issue is that my oldest daughter figured out how to open the gate at the age of 2.  However, by then she understood and obeyed when I told her WHY she couldn't go through the gate.This gate is also taller than the average baby gate, which I love for my 12 month old climber.  She stacked pillows and climbed over the first gate I installed in that doorway.",5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"This is a great gate to display.  We needed to put a gate around our Christmas Tree and this worked perfectly.  It looked nicer than most of the other cheaper gates.  We needed to buy two of them, however, which was expensive, but we plan to use this after Christmas around our fireplace and other off limit places.  I definately recommend this product.",5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"We have used this gate since our oldest started moving around. Now 3 years and another child later it is still functioning great! It still looks and works as well as on day 1.We picked this for the top of our stairs so we could have a ""landing"" at the top. We did not like other gates where you have to balance on the top stair, with a baby in your arms, to open or close the gate.It is easy to open, but not for little ones. My 3.5 year old still cannot open this on his own.I would buy this same gate in a heartbeat.",5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,Can't say enough good things about it!  Best gate system on the market by a landslide![...],5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"We have weird staircases in our house with stairway walls that don't line up and banisters that make standard gates impossible.  This is the only gate that would work in sealing off our 2nd floor main living space from the stairs that lead to the foyer/finished basement below.  (See my pic above)  The joints allow you to customize the angle at which the gate extends from the walls.  If you need to remove it completely (say, if you are having furniture delivered), you can do so by pressing on the tabs at the top of each wall mount.  It's a handful, but one person can do it.We actually have two of these gates, since the stairway up to the bedroom level has similar issues that make most hardware mounted gates impossible.  In that case, we have the gate configured in a 90 degree angle, and it works equally well.As for operation, it is easily opened with one hand (while carrying your little one) and yet secure enough that our 13-month-old has yet to figure out how to do so himself.  When open, the doors stay open without swinging shut automatically, good for people who have pets and want them to be able to roam freely when the baby isn't home or is asleep in his crib.  (We have two cats, one of whom can easily jump the gates, one of whom cannot.)Of course, it's one of the most expensive hardware mounted gates sold, but well worth it in terms of flexibility and ease of use.",5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"I have to agree that this is well worth the money if you have a large door area, especially with high traffic.  I actually got this gate as a hand me down with two extension panels.  I was able to instal it myself in an hour or so, and it was very easy (I have had less luck with other brands).  It is attractive, sturdy, and easy to use.  It is expensive, but is worth it!",5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"After spending hours researching, we decided to purchase two Kidco Configure Gates (one around our crystal china cabinet and one in our family room). Worth every penny. Although a bit expensive, it has kept our 14 months old twin girls within the safety boundaries. We're planning to buy two more for the stairways.",5
Gerber 12-Pack Prefold Birdseye 3-Ply Cloth Diapers with Padding - White,my newborn soaks these in a single shot. In a couple of months they'll be useless except for furniture dusting duty.,1
Gerber 12-Pack Prefold Birdseye 3-Ply Cloth Diapers with Padding - White,"My mom used Gerber cloth diapers on me and my 3 siblings when we were growing up and I believe the quality of the ones made back then must have been better than what I've got today. I bought a pack of 12 and 2 of them ripped at the seams during their first wash. They don't seem to be very absorbent at all - they wick through my son's diaper covers and clothes. They do make good burp rags, though. I bought some of the chinese prefolds and I'm hoping to have better luck with them.",2
Gerber 12-Pack Prefold Birdseye 3-Ply Cloth Diapers with Padding - White,After searching for burp cloths my girlfriend recommended using these.  Let me tell you...it was the best purchase I made.  They are the perfect size and are very absorbant.  I have yet to be surprised with what these diapers can't do!,5
Gerber 12-Pack Prefold Birdseye 3-Ply Cloth Diapers with Padding - White,"These burp clothes are extremely thin.  They are so gauzy that you can see through them, so they won't even work for a game of ""peek-a-boo""!  These were not thick enough for me to use as a burp cloth, let alone the ""premium"" diaper it is touted to be.  These would not work in our house even as a dish cloth, let alone absorbing any type of baby mess!The only reason I didn't give only a single star is because Gerber was very nice about giving me a refund on these - they guarantee all their products.  I just don't think they described accurately what you are getting.  They are definitely not the diaper service quality, however, if you don't have 3 different levels of diapers to choose from at your local store, how would you even know that there were different grades of diapers when it says ""premium"" on the package?  They need to be more descriptive in their product packaging.  For burp cloths, I prefered the Kooshie baby brand which are very absorbant, very soft and durable as well.",2
Gerber 12-Pack Prefold Birdseye 3-Ply Cloth Diapers with Padding - White,I had these exact same burp clothes when I gave birth in 08 to my son so I figured with my second pregnancy I would buy them again big mistake they are made cheaper NOW you can see right through them I am going to have to fold them in half just so it will not go through on to my clothes I do not even think they will make it through a wash load what a disappointment they are worth maybe a dime each at best It is kinda hard to tell how thin they are unless you open the package I would suggest passing these up,1
Gerber 12-Pack Prefold Birdseye 3-Ply Cloth Diapers with Padding - White,"I purchased these to make burp cloths. I washed them, then sewed fabric to the center piece to customize them. We used the burp cloths for months!",5
Gerber 12-Pack Prefold Birdseye 3-Ply Cloth Diapers with Padding - White,"I used disposable diapers with my first two children and will use disposables again.  However, on the persistance of my mother, I did purchase some cloth diapers.  These were a life saver.  These are excellent when the baby has diaper rash, but you can't let them go completely nude.  The cloth breaths much better that plastic.  If your baby has diaper rash, these are a must!",3
Gerber 12-Pack Prefold Birdseye 3-Ply Cloth Diapers with Padding - White,I love these cloth diapers. I use them everyday to care for my newborn. I mostly use them as burp cloths and as extra protection for the changing pad during diaper changes. They wash up great. I would highly recommend these cloth diapers.,5
Gerber 12-Pack Prefold Birdseye 3-Ply Cloth Diapers with Padding - White,"These are not like the diapers I used back when my child was an infant.  They are thin, non-absorbent, and are useful only as diaper liners.  (But why soil two diapers if one good one would suffice?) Instead, buy Chinese prefolds.",1
Gerber 12-Pack Prefold Birdseye 3-Ply Cloth Diapers with Padding - White,"I was excpecting great quality from the Gerbers prefolds I received a couple of weeks ago. I was very disappointed. They were so thin and cheaply sewn that I could not use them individually for my son. I had to sew two of them together to even make them thick enough to absorb a small amount of liquid. After one time through the wash, the edges of the cloths were fraying. These are not made to last and I would not purchase them again.",1
Gerber Diaper Service Cloth Diapers (6-pk.),"The item pictured and described is not the item you will recieve.  I ordered 4 pakcages of these diaper service diapers and got a completleydifferent diaper.  These are thicker, better quality and have blue stitching and ""Gerber"" stamp on them that distinquish them to be the diaper service diapers.  The diapers I got were thinner, plain white and had no stamp. Buyer beware!  You will not get what you see in this current photo!",1
3-in-1 Fold and Go Changing Kit,"This little thing is very handy. No, there is no padding under the mat. That's okay with me - I wanted something really compact. 2-3 diapers fit comfortably in the netting; 4 is a squeeze. That was nice when I had 2 kids in diapers because I could put 2 of each size in the pocket. The great thing about this is that you can just grab it and go - no need to take the whole bulky diaper bag into the bathroom. We ended up having a much smaller diaper bag as a result. It is actually one of the Old Navy messenger bags.The wipes holder is hard plastic, which I like. Unfortunately we stepped on it and it cracked. We bought a replacement one - it is standard size.",5
3-in-1 Fold and Go Changing Kit,I love this product. What a great deal.  It was always a pain to haul around a huge diaper bag everywhere.  I will buy this for the next shower I go to.,5
The First Years Nature Sensations Lullaby Player,"This lullaby player is wonderful. Our baby is 4 1/2 months, and we've had to go into her room several times/night to replace her pacifier for 4 months(didn't have the heart to let her cry it out). The lullaby player has helped us in teaching her to go to sleep on her own. She no longer has a pacifier in her crib. I wanted to use the rainfall or ocean sounds for white noise, but it turned out our baby liked the lullaby setting better.The voice activiation is why I bought it and why it works so well. We rarely go into her room at night now, because as soon as she cries, the player turns on.The only bad thing is a really bad thing. It just inhales the batteries. I assume it uses them so quick because it has to be on all night so the voice activation can be ready. But, we have to replace batteries AT LEAST one a week. This product would be perfect if it could be plugged in.",4
The First Years Nature Sensations Lullaby Player,"This product was not was I expected. It didn't fit on the side of my crib, the sounds were not at all nice, and the voice activation required the baby to be almost screaming in order for it to turn on. So far this is the only thing I have had to return.",2
The First Years Nature Sensations Lullaby Player,"This little gadget has been really handy.  We live in an urban area where noise is constantly waking up baby.  The relaxing sounds this &quot;thing&quot; makes covers up a lot of those noises so that they don't wake baby up.  I'm also able to snap the crib bar into the upright position now without startling my little girl.The lullably player offers a few choices of sounds.  We like the ocean waves the best.  The sound of the rain storm is also nice.  (The lullaby tune and the heart beat sounds are a bit too mechanical and rigid sounding and don't really calm baby down.)I didn't have a problem with the batteries being used up quickly.  I think they lasted about 2 weeks.  (You have to make sure to turn the unit off during the day when you're not using it.)  When I did have to change the batteries, though, I found it VERY difficult to get to the battery section.  (I still haven't figured out how to get into that battery section to change the batteries)Another problem with this unit is that it's supposedly has the ability to turn itself off after 15 minutes.  For some reason, mine stays on all night, though this really hasn't been a problem for us so far.The night light isn't really practical, either.  When we check on baby at night, we find that it's easier and dimmer when we turn a light on in a neighboring room.Despite its problems, I found the unit very helpful.  ...Now I just need to figure out how to change those batteries!",4
The First Years Nature Sensations Lullaby Player,"We've owned the player for about 5 months and our daughter loved the music and night light. However, one day, there was a loud pop and when we opened it up, the batteries were leaking. The company's warranty says it doesn't cover the product under battery leakage. So they know about the problem, but they will not fix it. And the batteries do not last long in this product. Buyers beware, pick a safer option for your children.",1
The First Years Nature Sensations Lullaby Player,"after reading the reviews i decided to purchase this for my 5 mth old son who was sleeping only 1 to 2 hours at a time at night. once my husband and i figured out that it must be street noise that was waking him (noises a fan could not block), we decided to try this product - a bonus was that it attaches to the crib. it worked great - my son is sleeping for 4 + hours at a time. it does eat batteries - especially being run all night. we tried rechargable batteries, but those were drained in hours. we decided to return this product and we purchased an actual white noise machine by marpac. it plugs in, and is small enough to be close to the crib and loud enough to effectively block street noise. another drawback to this product is that the sounds are not that great of quality - especially the lullabies. the rain is the only tolerable sound and it just sounds like static. if you have a problem sleeper, invest in a real white noise machine that plugs in.",3
The First Years Nature Sensations Lullaby Player,"I loved this item BUT the batteries were ALWAYS dying. This thing just sucks the life out of batteries like you wouldn't imagine.  It is a great idea and my son loved it, but do NOT plan to use it the whole night or many nights or you will find it dead in the morning.",3
The First Years Nature Sensations Lullaby Player,i bought this to help my 10 week old baby sleep better.  and ever since i have started using this she sleeps better and longer.  the lullaby mode sounds a little wierd but i use it for the heartbeat and waves!,5
The First Years Nature Sensations Lullaby Player,"This is a great product, but more sound options would be nice (which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars).  Other than that, the automatic shutoff feature is very nice.  We keep this attached to our son's bassinet which is by our bed.  The nightlight is absolutely perfect for checking on a sleeping baby (without waking anyone sleeping in the bed next to you).  I havent had any problems with it eating up batteries at all.",4
The First Years Nature Sensations Lullaby Player,"I have used this since my daughter was born, from her bassinet to her crib. She has been sleeping all night since she was 8 weeks old. She is now 15 months old and I still use it to put her to sleep and comfort her if she should wake up. It now sits on her dresser and I just use it from there.(she liked to mess with it too much as she got older). I have taken it with me on road trips and the sounds comfort her as if she was at home. I love this product and if I had to pick 5 of my favorites, it would be on top!Yeah, it eats batteries, I have to replace mine about every 3-4 weeks. But so what, she sleeps well and and goes to sleep on her own. And so what if the sounds are not perfect clarity, they work great as &quot;white noise&quot;. I have even put it on a few extra times to put myself to sleep listening through the baby monitor. :)",5
The First Years Nature Sensations Lullaby Player,"The Nature's Lullaby Player is easy to attach to the baby's crib or bassinet.  It features a soft light that quietly turns on and off with a push of a button.  Of the four sounds it offers, we like the rainfall - it provides a soft &quot;white noise&quot; that you can set to automatically turn off after a few minutes.  We use this almost every night for our newborn.",4
The First Years Nature Sensations Lullaby Player,"I love this. I think this is a great item, I love the fact if the baby starts crying it will automatically come on which will help the little one get back to sleep .... I think that little bit of extra sleep is worth every penny.",5
The First Years Nature Sensations Lullaby Player,"My son loved this lullaby player from 3-6 months, but about the 7th month he started to realize that the sounds on the lullaby player meant it was bedtime, and the fight to get him to sleep was horrid after he'd hear the sounds.  He's at the age where he really fights it. We love our Ocean Wonders Aquarium now, and we have the Crib CD player and he loves that too.  I would definitely recommend the crib cd player and some baby einstein classical cds over this player.",2
The First Years Nature Sensations Lullaby Player,"This was a definite must have.  My 3 month old son gets startled very easily and would wake up 2 maybe 3 times a night.  My husband and I would try to let him cry himself back to sleep but after 5 minutes his little wimpers would become wails and sobbing so we would have to get up and console him.  After several nights this way I saw the Nature's Lullaby Player and decided to try it out.  The first few nights he would still get up but now it was only once or twice.  Then the night came when he would startle, wimper and then the Lullaby Player put him back to sleep.  Yes!!!! We no longer need to get up with him.  My only complaint is that it takes a lot of batteries and the heartbeat could be a little softer sounding (it doesn't sound like it does in the womb).",5
The First Years Nature Sensations Lullaby Player,"Our son had problems falling asleep and staying asleep for the first 3 or 4 months.Luckily, we bought this product and have been using it every night since.My son is now 13 months old and turns this on himself when he goes to bed or wakes up in the middle of the night.  This seems to be his favorite crib toy.And it still works wonders on getting him to sleep when he is not feeling good, extremely tired or fussy.The voice activation feature is a great idea!  It's the only way to go.The night light is also an awesome feature.  It's not too bright and not too dark.  The button to turn it on is easy to find in the dark.  It's great to use to check on the baby, change the baby's diaper, etc.  (It's not too bright to turn on and wake your spouse if your baby is sleeping in your room)This product is just such a good buy.It clips onto the crib, bassinet or play yard.  We have used it on all three.This was definitely a life saver for my husband and I, especially the first 4 months.It's also very durable.  We have never had a problem with this and it still looks as good as it did when we first bought it.This is a wonderful gift to give to new mothers or mothers-to-be.  They will probably get quite a bit of use out of it.",5
Koala Baby - Portable Crib Sheet - Pink,"I have purchased two of the pink Koala Baby portable crib sheets and one crib skirt.  The sheets fit the portable crib mattress tightly and held up well through the wash.  The crisp color faded a bit after washing and drying several times, but the color still matches the crib skirt well.  I would purchase this product again if in need.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I was recommended to use these bottles by a girlfriend who had used them with her baby and sworn by them. I started with a set of 4oz bottles with newborn nipples (#1) and have graduated now to the 9oz bottles with the next size up nipples (#2). I will simply buy new nipples when she's ready for the next step. I am absolutely thrilled with these bottles.  I do have an occasional leak but it is always my own fault for not screwing the lid on tight enough!I have not had any problems with leaking when I have them put together correctly. They were especially good for going back and forth between breast feeding and bottle feeding. My now 4mos old baby never had any difficulties feeding either way and transitioned very smoothly. One reader referred to air being pushed into the bottle during feeding and causing her baby to swallow air. The air wooshing in is a good thing! It prevents a vacuum from developing inside the bottle and allows the baby to continuously feed without having to stop to relieve the pressure inside the bottle. The only time I ever had any problems with mine swallowing air was when she had pretty much outgrown the newborn nipples and would try to suck too hard when she was very hungry. This was immediately corrected by buying the next size up. They're also very easy to clean and can be effectively washed in the dishwasher because of their wide neck. Regular bottles cannot. I, out of necessity, used another brand of bottle with her today at a relative's house and was reminded why I like Avent bottles so much!",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"If I had not been given a ton of Avent bottles, I would have chosen some other system.  The leaking is terrible!!!  You have to buy the disks separately, you should get them for free because they are absolutely essential.  The only way to mix formula in the bottle or transport liquid is to use the disks in the ring, then switch to the nipple when you are ready to feed.  The only reason I give it a two is because I do like that you can pump directly into the bottle with the ISIS breast pump.  And, I like the sippy cups.",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,Leaks! Especially difficult to get a tight seal if you use one hand (while holding baby). A much better design is the Breast Flow Learning Curve First Years bottles. Instead buy The First Years 3pk. Breastflow 5oz. Bottles These worked much better for me.,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have been using the Avent bottle system for six months and have been completely satisfied. I introduced an Avent bottle to my daughter at four weeks old and she transitioned easily between breast and bottle. She is still breastfed in the morning and evenings but receives an Avent bottle at daycare and has never had a problem. I have never had a bottle leak of which other consumers have complained. I would recommend this system to any parent, especially those of part-time breastfed babies.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I used Avent bottles with my son when he was two weeks old. We only used them on the rare occasion I wasn't available to nurse him (first time was a funeral!). He NEVER had a problem latching on the bottle nipple, and then back to me when I got home. Expressing milk and having Dad, Grandma and Grandpa give him bottles now and then was nice for everyone involved. I can't recall a single time the bottle leaked as others complained. Perhaps it's not the brand that was the problem but the individual nipple or bottle. Also, he was used to working harder at my breast to get milk, but never seemed to get too much from the bottle, no matter how hard he sucked. Again, maybe it was that particular nipple, not the whole brand. Anyway, I loaned all of my Avents to my friend when he adopted a newborn. She's an Avent Girl all the way! Now that my second child is on the way, I'm registering for more!",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These bottles are simply the best out there. I know, I tried ""ALL"" of them.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I purchased these bottles for my older baby who drinks more than 9 oz at night.  These work well for us because we don't have to refill them as often and the nipples work on his trainer sippy cups from avent.,4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"After reading the reviews of these bottles leaking, I personally found a way to keep from it.  When heating in the express bottle heater (after being in the fridge), I loosen the top of the bottle to let the pressure out.  After its ready, I then take the whole top off, wipe off the condensation on the rim (inside and out), then screw on snug, but not real tight.  It solves the leaking problem.  Another review I read said that screwing on too tight also causes leakage.  Ive not had a leaking problem since I started doing this.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I really wanted to like these bottles because they are wide and they don't have any funny parts. But these things leak and leak. What a shame.,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"In the midst of all of my bottle testing, I was against Avent, mostly because they do cost a bit more than most bottles.  I thought that I could test a bottle and cup, to see if Avent was really telling the truth when they said all the parts were interchangeable.  Well, they are.  They also have more nipple selections, depending on how fast your child drinks.One thing I wish Avent has was a design or something on the bottle. I did find that if you buy the Evenflo Cool Pals 9 oz. cup holder, these fit in them great.I would suggest only getting 2 packs of these, couple of Magic Cups with handles and some extra spouts (have at least 2 green ones and 1 white one).",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I had started with these bottles.  Then I called AVENT, and they told me these bottles contain BPA.  I switched to the Tempo Liner bottles and they work just as well.",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"The Avent system works great!  We have never has air/gas issues, and our daughter has never experienced nipple confusion.  We had to introduce the bottle at four days old and went back to the breast at one month without issue.  The nipples can be used on the sippy cups, the nipples can be replaced with storage inserts.  I use these bottles to tote food and to freeze homemade food.  I like the various number of hole nipples you can buy.  This is an excellent bottle!",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I bought these for my daughter. I have been using them since she was born, but I have had (like a lot of other people) trouble with them leaking. I have had so many problems with leaks that I am considering not using them for my next child. Sometime the only way to fix the leak is to take the nipple out of the ring and run water over it. As you can imagine, this is not very helpful when we are away from home. I have tried to just not screw them down as tight, but it doesn't always work.",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These bottles are terrible~once you get comfy with baby and start feeding~they leak all over, then you & baby are soaked (and smelly~especially when on whole milk) and no longer relaxed.  Terrible!!!",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I had been afraid that my breastfed baby would prefer the bottle once I started pumping. Instead, we found that he did not like the bottle at all. We had received a free sample of the Avent bottle, and discovered that he liked the nipple much more than the ones on the Medela nursing set that goes with my breast pump. He still would much rather get the real thing, but daddy finds it much easier to feed him with the Avent bottle. My one concern is that the plastic is much more rigid than that of the Medela set...am afraid of dropping over hard surface.",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Avent bottles are the closest to mother's breast as far as the nipples and the shape and quanity it holds is great. It is very easy to pump breast milk into. I have tried other bottles but i keep coming back to Avent they are the best. All Avent products are superior to all others.Mom of 2 children and one on the wayI will only use Avent for my kids.ThanksAna Soto, New York",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I'm not a big fan of these bottles.  I think they let too much air into my baby's belly.  I think they are generally over rated.  I do however have to stick up for them.  They do not leak if put together correctly.  The most important thing is to make sure that they are completely dry before putting them together.  If there are wet at all they will leak.  Also you have to make sure you have the nipple fully pulled through the cap.,3
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I love these bottles! I haven't had any problems with leakage as I did with other brands, and I just love how Avent makes other products too. I have the bottles, sterilizer and the breast pump and I love them all!",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I bought these bottles for my first child 2 years ago and loved them then.  Now with my newborn, they are still like new, and I still love them.  I breastfeed her, but she takes one bottle a day without a problem.  Yes, if the white rim is screwed on too tightly, they will leak.  Simply check before feeding.  I've really enjoyed using there entire feeding system from bottles to sippy cups to sterilizer.  Very well made products.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"i was pumping for my daughter when she was born and used these bottles and they were great for storage and easy conversion to a bottle, however the milk leaked out of her mouth all over the place and breast milk is precious. i wasted alot and ended up switching to another bottle. also the flow was too slow on the stage 1 and too fast on stage 2 for her as a newborn. it took almost 25min for her to finish 3-4oz. while it only took 10 or so with a standard bottle. Easy for starge to bottle conversion though.i do not recomend these bottles.",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"You turn the cap less or you make it tight,No matter how you try, you wont get it right.You think they drank four, but they only got three,Because below their mouths, the bottle's on a leaking spree.The thing is going to leak, screw it as you might.Who needs this aggravation, at 3 in the night.Warm milk or cold milk, no matter what it holds,Its gonna leak out and seep into their neck folds.You'll need a calibrated wrench, from the Institute of Measures,Who needs these leaky hassles, to feed their little treasures.Each time I use them now, I end up swearing,Many have leaked similar complaints, how can Avent be so uncaring?",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have used both the 4 oz. and the 9 oz. bottles to feed my 3 month old son, and the bottles are so leaky!  The problem seems to have gotten progressively worse over time because now they leak to the point that I'm not sure how much my son is ingesting and how much is soaking his bib and burp cloth.  I tried adjusting the nipple and tightening or loosening the collar - nothing has stopped the leakage.  I have switched to Gerber New Traditions bottles with no problem so far.  I gave this product 2 stars instead of 1 because the nipple shape is very similar to the real thing, and that's always a plus for someone who wants to combine bottle and breastfeeding.",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"As a mother of four, I have tried just about everything out there in the way of bottles.  Now I have a 5 week old daughter and she loves the Avent bottles.  I have never had an issue with nipple confusion.  She also uses the Avent paci's.  No problems at all with going from breast to bottle to binky.  I have read other posts about the bottles leaking or not getting any flow from the nipples.  I hate to say it but these posters are not using the products properly.  If I were exclusively bottle feeding this child, like I did the others, I would completely understand about sleepy 3am bottle woes.  However a simple remedy would be to put them all together after they have been washed.  Why would anyone wait until baby is hungry to put the nipple into the ring?  I think some people are just asking for more work.  That being said, I am now a die-hard Avent fan and use many of their products.  I hope others will do the same!",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"My son has reflux so we have an ongoing battle with spit up in our house. When I stopped breast feeding I tried a couple different types of bottles and eventually ended up sticking with Dr. Brown's because they helped the most with his gas and spit up. After 3 months of washing all of the parts that Dr. Brown's bottles have, I decided to try Avent. I like the bottles, they are made of a good quality material and they are wide, which made it really easy for me to mix formula in them. My son didn't have a problem latching on or anything, and his gas didn't get any worse, but his spit up became out of control!!!! He began spitting up twice as much as he did on the Dr. Brown's bottles. I was forced to switch back to Dr. Brown's because I just couldn't handle changing his clothes and mine 5 times a day. So they just didn't work for my baby. However, I never had a problem with them leaking...they are pretty good bottles!",3
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Since I knew I wouldn't be breastfeeding after returning to work, I began researching bottles before my daughter was born.  Avent bottles received great reviews and now I know why.  The transition from nursing to bottles was a breeze thanks to the patented design of the Avent nipples.  My daughter never developed nipple confusion and never once rejected feeding from the bottle.  The Avent bottles with the wider neck are easier to clean and the Avent sterilizing system makes them even easier to sterilize.  I recommend this product to any mother who wants whats next to best when it comes to feeding their newborn.  Of course, nursing is the number one method.  The only reason why I didn't rate this product a 5 star product is because the bottles are unusually wide.",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"The only drawback I've seen to these bottles is they sometimes leak and the nipples are too tall to fit in the top of my nipple washer for the dishwasher.  Other than that, it's great!  I do recommend getting some of the &quot;older&quot; nipples as my daughter got frustrated with the bottle with a newborn nipple on it as she got older.",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I started using these bottles prior to going back to work, wanting a bottle similar to the (...).  My daughter took the nipple, no problem.  I didn't have a problem with leaks...as everyone else noted, you just screw the nipple ring on lightly and assemble the nipple and ring while wet...that's all it takes.  I do however have a problem now with terrible gas build up in the evenings and gas noises that make my husband blush!!! .  You moms know the screams of a baby with gas build-up...it's awful.  I had been using gas drops, but wanted a solution and not a quick fix. I switched to the Dr. Brown's bottles and she hasn't had the painful gas since!!!",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"The appearance and size are nice, but these bottles cost too much to have them leaking all over you when you are trying to feed your baby. They are not worth the money because they leak way too much.",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"OK first they are easy to clean.  Second the nipples DO NOT collapse. Third, they cut down on bubbles.  Sometimes they leak, but thats easy to cure...DONT SCREW EM ON SOOOO TIGHT!  LOL....buy em, you wont go wrong!",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"The Avent bottles leak terribly.  I would not recommend buying them to anyone.  It is hard enough waking up in the middle of the night to feed, but add in getting all wet (me and baby).  It isn't just me who has had this problem, which I initially thought.  I have asked several people if this has happened to them and it has.  We've even tried purchasing new nipples, thinking it was that, and it didn't matter.  The bottles seem to have a defect, according to a friend who used to use them years ago and NEVER had the problem then (but NOW does).",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I had nothing but leakage problems with these bottles. I contacted the company and they told me all these different tips of assembling the bottles that should stop leakage. Needless to say none worked. Luckily for me I was able to return the larger bottles. I am although stuck with eight of the smaller ones. First off let me say when you are sleep deprived you dont' want to be worrying if the bottle lip has a drop of water on it that will cause it to leak or if you have over tightened or under tightened.  There is no time to worry about all these little things when you have a hungry screaming baby. The bottles are by far not cheap and there shouldn't be so many issues.  I have many friends that have said that theirs leaked as well...too bad they didn't tell me before I registered for them.  Oddly enough if you buy a bottle in the .99 cent store you don't have all these issues.  When I returned the larger ones to Babies R US there were a lot of other returns as well.  I will give these to my daughters to play with their dolls.  In addition to the leakage I noticed that my son was extremely gassy and would cry so much after eating.  I have told my friends who are registering now to save their money and find an alternate bottle.,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These were the only bottles I ever gave to my baby, so I'm not sure if she would have liked something better, but she seems to really like them now.  She does seem to like the nipple shape and the air stays out of the tip.  The only drawback is that they leak and squeak loud if you tighten the cap too tight.  Overall, we are very happy with the Avent bottles and nipples, I probably wouldn't buy anything else.",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Yeah, they do leak sometimes, but to me it's no big deal.  Yes, there doesn't seem to be a pattern, but again, it doesn't happen frequently enough to really wig me out.",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I have read the past few reviews given for these bottles and I wonder if we are talking about the same bottles.  I too breastfeed and pump. I have tried the Dr. Brown bottles and the Evenflo Ventair bottles and have to say that none of them can even come close to these bottles.  I am yet to see one drop of milk drip out of the bottle.  Maybe the ladies are not assembling the bottle tops correctly!LOVE THEM!,5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I like the avent bottles a lot... the tops are extra wide to be able to put formula mix in, without getting it all over the counter.  I don't think these bottles seem to help my son with gas, he's just a baby, and they are generally gassy.  The bottles do tend to leak if the inside of the white ring is not completely dry first.  Overall I've been pretty happy with them though, I've never contempated switching.**I do however recommend just skipping the 4 oz bottles and buying just all 9 oz bottles... My son is 3 weeks old and is already taking 6 oz, so anytime we use the 4 oz bottles, we have to make an additional 2 oz after he empties the bottle.  I wish I had just registered for another package of 9 oz instead of 4 oz.",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I registered for these bottles because all of my friends recommended them. My 3 week old daughter has difficutly with these bottles because the formula just pours out the sides of her mouth. She used the Stage 1 nipple and they are too fast for her. We tried the Playtex Ventaire- she latched on well to those but they caused too much gas. She cried in pain. Today I'll be making a trip to purchase Dr. Brown's bottles to see how they work...,3
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,This bottle was a life saver.  I didn't think anything about the leaking because babies are washable.  I was able to put her ceral in the bottle before bed time and the hole house got a good nights sleep.  My daughter has less gas and is happy when I put fruit and other things in this bottle.  It's just a wonderful bottle.,4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have been using Avent bottles for 5 months and was unaware of any problems with leakage until I read these reviews. I purchased the breast pump pack with bottles in Australia, where I'm from, and used them several times a week when I needed someone else to feed my baby breast milk. My breast milk became ineffective after 4 months so I am using the bottles full time to feed my baby formula and still have never experienced leakage. I've also purchased bottles from here in the U.S. and still had no problems. I'll admit too that I'm not a good one for reading instructions so after sterilising the bottles they are sometimes assembled dry and sometimes wet...I didn't know it made a difference (obviously it doesn't). Mine have always been hand washed though. I don't like to put them in the dishwasher. From someone who breastfed for 4 months before putting my baby onto formula I find the Avent nipples excellent and simulate a real nipple very well. My baby's lips sit over and under the rounded part of the nipple just as they did on my breast. My baby also has trouble bringing up wind but the problem is nowhere near as bad when he uses the Avent nipples as I've been able to control the flow with their numbered system....he takes in nowhere near as much air as a nice slow flow prevents him from having to gulp quickly. I couldn't be more pleased with the performance of Avent bottles.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I have been nursing and am now switching our daughter to abottle.  We've tried several different bottles and these were the ones my daughter will take.  We have a terrible time with them leaking.  Breastmilk is like gold to me and its very frustrating when I pull the bottle out of the diaper bag with half of it all over the bag!!  We are currently trying different brands again.,2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These bottles leak.  It doesn't matter how you assemble them, or if you assemble them wet, or dry, or in space, or in a cave.  They leak.  Terribly.  And Avent knows it.  They will even replace your leaky bottles if you call 1800 54avent.  Of course the ones they replace it with also leak.  Buy Dr. Browns instead.",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Just when you least expect it for no obvious reason these bottles leak.  And by leaking I mean leak A LOT.  A lot of milk dribbles out...down your arm, onto your lap...all over your chair.  It's really annoying, especially since these bottles are NOT cheap.  You'd think they could design them better than this!  And after awhile, just when you forget how much they leak...bam!  It happens again.  This is the second time I've used these bottles (I kept them for my second child because they cost so much I didn't want to replace them) and the leaking has annoyed me so much that I was inspired to get online and post this review!  You'd think after all this time I would have figured out how to keep them from leaking, but no, there's no rhyme or reason to it.  I would strongly recommend another brand.",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"very leaky...when you call they dont ake the situation any better. They say it's do to washing bottles with anti bacterial soap, etc. botto line these bottles stink and they are expensive. Don't bother!",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I registered for these bottles because I got the manual breast pump from Avent.  The breastpump was phenominal but trying to feed my baby with these bottles, whether using breastmilk or formula, was impossible.  The nipples get clogged and my son got frustrated from sucking so much.  Also, they leaked every where, whether from saking them to mix the formula or just by feedin the baby, they always leaked.  I wish I could get my money back.  I went and bought Gerber bottles, which work perfectly!",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Come on now, ladies...As a mom of 4, 41 years old, former child care provider, I have dealt with a lot of bottles. I can tell you that if you screw the lid on ANY bottle too tight, it IS going to leak. Solution? Shake the bottle well before popping it into your dear one's little mouth. If it should leak, loosen it, and screw it on again, do a test shake, and you're off! We recently adopted two little ones (my older ones are 11 and 9, the little onesare  22 months and 5 months), and my youngest is the first baby I've fed exclusively with a bottle. I have been very pleased with the ease of use of the Avent bottles, especially with how easy they are to clean.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I cant thank Avent enoughAs a first time mom I was totally crushed when I could not breastfeed right away(Due to inverted nipples)Well when my daughter was about 1 month old and the pump (also Avent) had brought them out a bit she started breastfeeding the transition was smooth she was a happy Breast and Avent-fed baby for 4 month.Even now 5 month later after daily boiling (in a pot)nipples and bottles are as good as the first timeregarding the leeaking I never had a problem whith that, ... As far as im concerned these are SIMPLY THE BEST And I would highly recomend them to all moms...",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Plain and simple - these bottles leak!  I wish I read the reviews before buying these Avent bottles.  My husband and I knew nothing about bottles so when our baby arrived 3 weeks early, we didn't get to research and quickly bought these. I bought several of them and when they leaked thought maybe there was just a bad one in the batch.  Every time one leaked, I removed it from the rotation.  Well, they all eventually leaked so I can't stand them; it's very aggravating.  I've since bought the Dr. Brown bottles and have had no problems with them.  I even think my baby is less gassy and spits up less with the Dr. Brown bottles.  People complain about the extra parts to clean of the Dr. Brown bottles, but that's less of a pain than having the Avent bottles leak all over you and the baby and wasting formula.  I'm going to write to Avent and see if I can get my money back.",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have had 3 children, all formula fed from birth, and we only used this brand with the 3rd child - mainly because I could not find the brand I used previously (Canon Babysafe).Yes, they are more expensive, but if you think how many times you use them and wash them ... you certainly get your money's worth.  I only have 6 and this suits us perfectly.I have not had any trouble with leaks and find they seal quite well for outings when they are in my nappy bag.My baby took the teat from birth with no problems.  But I know some mother's who had babies that just wouldn't take this teat and they had to switch brands.  I guess with everything to do with babies it's a case of trial and error to find what suits you and your baby.What I like about the bottles is that the wide opening makes them extremely easy to wash and easy to put formula in.  I used the narrow necked bottles previously and I was forever spilling formula trying to put the formula in with the scoops.  The Avent bottles are also very comfortable for me to hold and easy for my baby to grip on to as well.They suit us perfectly - give them a try and see what you think.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Yes, we too have experienced leaks with the Avents.  We've tried to figure it out- Is it the plastic ring?  Is the nipple fully inserted?  Is it not screwed on properly?  Is it a combo of all of these things?  Should it REALLY be this difficult????  I've had Avents leak all inside my diaper bag (didn't realize it until I smelled the sour formula), all down my sons chin and neck, and all over the floor.  We still use ours because I hate to waste money, but we have thrown a few away thinking THEY were the faulty ones... only to have other faulty ones crop up.  (My husband refuses to use the Avents now and only uses Dr. Browns.)  I think it may be a combo of the Avent nipple not sealing (make sure you really, really insert it well), and the ring not being screwed on right (check and double check), but in the end it's like that one sock that always gets lost in the dryer.  What could be the mystery problem??",3
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,Do NOT buy these bottles!!  Save yourself from a lot of stress & frustration!!  Our Avent bottles leaked all the time & our daughter had a lot of gas.  I called Avent customer service to find out how I could get my money back & they were extremely rude to me.  I very politely explained my problem with the bottles & the customer service representative immediately got a rude tone with me and said ""There is nothing I can do for you - we do not give refunds.  The problem is not with our bottles - you just are not using them properly."",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Many people complain about leaking and I must admit that it happened to me a few times too. So to prevent it from leaking I would screw on the top as tight as I could, and it would still leak. So that's when I figure it out.If you screw on the top too tight it will leak.Im telling you that this is true. My bottles have not leaked once since I figured this out. Just tighten it until it just first feels tight, and it will not leak.Saying that, I absolutly LOVE these bottles. The wide mounth is easy to clean. It's easy to figure out which size nipples to use as the baby outgrows them. And if your breast feeding, they have everything you need and it all works right with the bottles. No extra work! I highly recomend these.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,My son is 2 1/2 months old. We never have problems with our Born Free bottles but noticed that he cries and has stomach problems after being fed with the Avent bottles. I will keep them to use when he's older but they aren't good for newborns.,2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I've used Avent bottles for all my kids and have been the happiest with them.  The wide neck allows for easy cleaning which is incredibly important.  I like that when I can't nurse baby I know that they have a bottle that is shaped more like what they are used to, making it a pleasant feeding experience rather than a frustrating one.  I did have problems with the bottles leaking when I first started using them, which turned out to be from over tightening the caps on them...once that was fixed we had no more problems.  Great bottles!!",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I would give this system 0 stars if it would let me! I have the whole system, bottles, pump, warmer, pacifiers, you name it. My son hates the pacifiers, newborn size is not large enough to stay in his mouth and next size gags him. They are a bad design overall. The Nuk pacifiers are much better. They are softer and they conform to his face better. The nipples leak like crazy and the milk comes out of the newborn nipples WAY too fast. My son gags on that long hard nipple and then he gulps for air as the milk is being sprayed down his throat. It came out so fast that he would be drenched in milk within seconds of giving him the bottle. They also give him horrible air bubbles. He ends up spitting up a substantial portion of everything he takes in. We stopped using them and got the Playtex nurser with drop ins and he is much happier. The nipple on the playtex nurser is (contrary to Avent advertising) MUCH more like my nipple than the Avent nipple. It is soft and pliable and it sticks out only when he sucks on it-unlike the avent nipple that juts out permanently. Also, the bags on the disposable nurser leak. Their seams are very weak and would leak through both layers even when we double-bagged them. Avent has great advertising-that is about the only thing great about it.",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"i have zero complaints about these bottles. wish i had bought them in the first place (i started out with the playtex nurser system). they may be pricy compared to other bottles, but, you don't have to buy liners for these bottles. my daughter found these bottles much easier to hold herself than the playtex ones and these have a bigger selection of nipple flow to choose from (besides slow and fast, where fast for playtex really just means not so slow), so i put them away and got more of these, and my daugher was a much happier baby.what i found with the leaking some people complain about: if there is any liquid in the seal it will leak. this problem can easily be solved by wiping the inside of the ring that holds the nipple and the outside rim of the bottle with a dry rag, and if it squeaks when you screw the lid on, you're not going to have any leaks.hope this helps!",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"My daughter was a month early and I am having problems breast feeding so I got these bottles with special ""newborn"" nipples.  This was a big mistake, the flow is way too strong for a premie baby and was pouring out of the bottle all over her and they made her very gassy too.  They may be good for older babies (2-3 months) but not for a newborn.",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These Avent bottles are comparable to Playtex Ventaire and Dr. Brown's bottles in quality for ventilation...  I have found Avent bottles are simpler to put together with fewer parts to assemble...  However, I try not to use them for night feedings because they sometimes make loud squeaky noises as the air flows into the vents...  This unexpected noise has scared my baby on occasion when very quiet through the night...  Otherwise, one of the easiest to use ventilated bottles...  I also like the smaller version of this Avent bottle in the 4 ounce size...",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I was happy to read that other mothers have had problems with this bottle leaking and it wasn't just me doing something incorrectly. I recieved 2 Avent bottles as a free promotion and decided to try them. When they don't leak - I like the bottle very much. Sometimes I can get through a feed without a leak and sometimes I can't. I've kept the bottles as spares.,3
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I agree these bottle leak terribly, from the beginning. My husband figured out the simple engineering flaw, and its kindof appalling they don't fix them. I guess they think mothers like to be messy.",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I purchased these bottle after trying the Playtex Ventaire bottles, which I did not like.  While these bottles did reduce my baby's gassiness and feeding time, they constantly leak.You wouldn't think it would take a brain surgeon to screw the nipple/cap onto the bottle and not have it leak.  But the majority of the time, the formula leaks from the bottle. In the beginning my baby was wearing as much of the formula as he was eating.  I now find myself screwing, re-screwing and re-screwing the cap and holding it upside down over the sink as a test to see if the bottle leaks.  And then, just when you think it's safe,..lookout, the dreaded drip is back.  The last thing you want to do when you have a hungry and screaming baby is waste time testing the bottle to see if it's leaking.  And, it's not just me who has a problem with the bottles,--I know two other moms who have encountered the same problem.  Save yourself the aggrevation and buy another bottle system.This one has a MAJOR design flaw.",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I have tried five different types of bottles and these are horrible. Don't waste your money.  Dr. Brown's is the way to go!,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Sent me 3 bottles one of which didn't have a lid in the box.  Crappy quality control.  Just buy them at the store for more money, at least you'll get all the parts with it.  5 stars for avent, -5 stars for seller.",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"We have to admit that after 3 weeks of our son crying after feeding time even though we burped him and burped him he still had GAS!!!! We tried the Playtex Brand. We tried the Johnson's Brand.  He still got gas after feeding.  I did some research and figured that the Avent system just might work. He took to it without fussing and low and behold NO GAS!!!! Of course there was the ususal burping, but afterward no crying and no gas.  Thanks Avent!  To those out there who say they get the dribble when feeding, I say: It's not the bottle on the bum. It's the bum on the bottle. You're feeding him wrong. To those who have problems with the formula coming out too slow or not at all, I say:  Hello, have you ever heard of using a sterilized needle to clean it out?  Nipples do get clogged you know.  It's not the manufactures fault that you aren't keeping it clean.  Remeber to sterilize both the bottle and the nipple.  You need both working properly for a happy healthy baby.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,These bottles are excellent bottles for to prevent colic in babies.  The price is to expensive.,5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I have been using these bottles since my son was 3 wks old. We tried every bottle on the market and this is the one he liked.  It was so much like my breast it made switching between the 2 much easier.  But now he drinks formula all the time about 8oz at a time and it is crazy that at 4:00 in the morning I have to stop everything to change him and that makes him even more upset! I know how to screw the top on and I think it is crazy that you have to pay almost $5.00 a bottle and that you have to go through all these things to stop them from leaking!  He also has acid reflux and I thought this would be a great bottle to help with that.  Now I am learning from my mistakes! Were trying to get him to accept a new bottle and it is so hard because the avent bottles is all he wants now! I don't care what anyone says don't use these bottles unless you want more milk on you and your baby than in the bottle! It's crazy they should fix the problem and it's their problem to fix not the parents!! Come on now $5.00 a bottle! I have 12/ 4oz bottles 9/ 9oz bottles that is a lot of money down the drain!!!!!!!,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"We are very pleased with our Avent purchases.  We have no leakage problems and these wide bottles are easy to wash.  I am not sure if other systems have this, but Avent has &quot;adjustable flow&quot; nipples.  These nipples have 3 settings for flow, depending on how you hold the bottle.  So, when our baby grows and needs more flow, we don't have to buy new nipples or poke new holes.  Avent also has a small microwave sterilizer that can sterilize 4 bottles at a time...we use it all the time for bottles, pacifiers, etc.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These bottles came recommended to me, and I am glad I invested the money.  There is a reason why the Avent bottles are a little more expensive than competitors.  I'm a breasfeeding mother, however, when my son turned four weeks old, we wanted to introduce a bottle so his father and other family members could feed him, giving me a break.  He took to it right away, and I note that he latches on the Avent nipple like that of mine.  So, if you are a breasfeeding mother who wants to use a bottle part-time, then these should be your choice!  I also don't see my son having a lot of gas issues, and they clean up real easy, too--not like some of the bottles my friends have used.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I love the Avent bottles!This is my second child, so I have tried multiple products on the market.  What benefits are heads above the other bottles in my experience include...-- my little guy can manage the wider nipple much more easily with much less air intake than the traditional narrow nipple (we actually use a combination of breast feeding and the Avent bottles without any signs of him being confused or wanting to give up the breast)-- the nipples are durable compared to the Evenflo nipples I used with my first child, so I have not been faced with the problem of constant replacement-- the wider, shorter bottle design keeps the bottle itself from tipping over whether you are using the 4 or 9 ounce size-- the wider bottle design is easier for my little guy to grab onto.  This is a good step toward self-help skills.  I have even started using the sippy cup handles with some bottle feedings to help us move forward into that new world more smoothly.To address the leaking complaint from some reviewers...No matter what bottle you choose, you will have leaking if you do not put it together in a way that works with that system.I was rarely having a leaking problem and found a tip from another reviewer that solved the mystery of the occasional leaker... wet the base of the nipple before assembling the bottle.As a busy mom, I found myself only occasionally putting together bottles after all parts were dry - on those occasions we had leaking.  However, the leaking was pretty minor and easily corrected by unscrewing, wiping the bottle and inner part of the ring, and rescrewing.  After reading this tip about wetting the nipple base with water before assembly, we have been leak free!Now we're looking forward to graduating up to the Avent sippy cups in a couple of months.  Good luck to you in whatever system you find works for your child's healthy eating.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"After many incidences of soaking my daughter by feeding her with these leaking bottles, or shaking them and splattering breastmilk or formula all over the kitchen, I strongly recommend not buying this product.  Of all the things that are challenging and frustrating about caring for a new baby, bottle-feeding should not be one of them.",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,i love this brand.  they work great.  they will be great for when my daughter has out grown the bottle...i can use them to put her food in when traveling.  the size is so perfect and they stack easily when you don't use the nipples in them.  perfect product!,5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These bottles are wonderful! I breastfed and bottle fed my daughter from the begining.  She didn't have any problem with nipple confusion at all, but as she got a little older, she didn't know how to suck on the regular nipples.  I was using Evenflo Sensitive Response nipples.  So, when I bought the Isis pump, I found my daughter LOVED these bottles.  She knew right away how to suck on them, and unlike the Evenflo nipples, the milk did not run all down her chin.  I like the fact that I can pump both sides using one bottle, unlike with the 4 oz. bottles, where I have to switch for each side.  They are a bit expensive, but it definatly is worth it.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"This is an okay bottle when they don't leak.  I know that you have to follow the directions to the letter, however that doesn't always work to prevent leaks from occuring.  When they don'[t leak they are fantastic, when you get a leak they are horrible.  You end up with half the bottle all over your hands and on the baby.  I continue to use them because the are the only bottles my son likes and I have tried them all.  So keep in mind that even though you follow the directions you may still run into leaks.",3
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These bottles are the best.  We use them for our three month old daughter who is breastfeed and uses a bottle.  We have never had trouble with leaking like others have said.  The bottles are somewhat more expensive, but worth the extra cost.  One piece of advice.....If your child nurses, there is no need to change the nipples to the faster flows as they get older.  We changed nipples to the slow and medium flow and it was too fast for her (I wish someone would have told me this before we bought all the other nipples).  We are switching back to the newborn nipples (see AVENT web-site for this info).  Since these bottles are so great, our daughter makes an easy transition from bottle to breast.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I switched to these bottles when DD was approx. 5 months old.  I *love* these bottles.  They have been wonderful for her spit up issues and they are easy for both her and I to hold.  Let me start by saying I was very hesistant about buying this bottle due to the bad reviews about it leaking.  I have not had this problem.  I have found (another user posted this and it works) that you should always assemble the nipple and the ring whilst wet and when you are screwing the ring on to the bottle, give it a counter clockwise turn until you hear it ""click"" into place and then proceed to turn it clockwise until closed.  Also, do not tighten it down like Heman would.  You just need it to be closed and sealed.  Another thing that made my purchase worry free was the fact that I bought them from Babies R Us and told them of my concerns and they told me if the bottles leaked, I could bring them back with my receipt.  All in all, these bottles are great and we have not had one problem.  I will use these with any subsequent babies as well.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I bought these bottles because it was the ""THING TO DO"", but I am not satisfied at all.  I thought I was crazy, until I started asking around.  The Avent bottles definitely have a tendency to leak.  Sometimes they don't, but most of the time they do!  I can't seem to figure it out.  The leaking is incredibly frustrating.  (...)",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"There are already hundreds of reviews with plenty of opinions, but one thing you might want to know is that the 9 oz three-pack comes with 1m+ ""slow flow"" 2 hole nipples.  (Not the 0m+ newborn 1 hole nipples.)",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,Every time I would try to feed my 3 month old daughter it would end up down the front of her shirt instead of down her mouth. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY AND MILK!,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I chose these bottles because they were thought to be the best and most expensive on the market and was very disappointed. I got the whole system and later realized that the bottles leak! I had many frustrating nights changing my son's clothing at 3:00 am because he was completely soaked from these bottles leaking out of the side.It is very hard to tell how much he was getting considering that half of the bottle was leaking down the side. Every member of my family has tried to prevent the leakage and it is impossible! After all the money invested in this product I am very disappointed and do not recommend these bottles to anyone.,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Before my son was born, I spent a lot of time reading the reviews on the different feeding systems.  Because we live on a small base in Germany, we do not have a wide selection available to us at out Post Exchange.  I bought a few bottles from the PX and tried them out, but he didn't like any of them.  They would allow the milk to dribble down his face or not enough milk would come out and frustrate him.I bought a single Avent bottle... they were the most expensive and I was hesitant to invest so much money on the Avent system.  I followed the directions (something that a few of the other commenters are obviously not doing) and this bottle worked the best.I have bought a ton of Avent products and they all work fine!  The only time my bottles leak is when my dear hubby fills them... he doesn't follow product instructions LOL.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I loved the Avent bottles.  I am breastfeeding my son and needed a bottle that would be like my breasts.  At first i used the Playtex Vent-Air, but when i would breast feed him he would be confused, but none of this happened with Avent!",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"My daughter was born 3 & 1/2 weeks early and had to stay at the hospital for a week, she was lazy at the breast but did great with these bottles which came highly recommended by a friend.  I only have an ocassional problem with leakage when you twist it shut it seems that every 1 in 10 times it leaks.  I don't mind the leaking except that it takes several tries to re-twist it before it stops leaking.  I hate losing precious breastmilk to leaks, thats why I gave it only 4 stars.",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"We have uses these bottles for 2 months.  About 1 out of 3 bottles leak.  And we're not talking a drop or two.  We're talking about milk flowing out of the cap as if it's not even secured.  You can insert the nipple into the screw cap, hear the ""click"", squeeze it tight, squeeze it loose, squeeze it any degree between, but they leak.  AVENT's website even has a section on how to prevent the bottles from leaking. You want to know why?  Because they leak.  AVENT bottles must be the poorest designed product we have used in the past year.  They leak, and they leak.  They leak at the worst times, they leak and the best.  If you want to ensure that your feeding experience with your child will be ruined 33 percent of the time, by all means -waste your money on this poor excuse for a product.  AVENT should be ashamed of themselves.",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have read a review (probably from the manufacturer) suggesting people are experiencing dripping because we don't follow directions. I have two kids, and believe that the problem is just that the bottles are poorly designed. I have had to change my kid's shirts at three in the morning because they get wet from the bottle. This is so frustrating that not only am I taking the time to tell anybody who is interested to not buy this product but I am also writing the manufacturer to complain and get my money back. Save your sanity, it really is that frustrating.",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Both bottles do a fine job of keeping bubbles out of your baby.  We tried and used both bottles with our boy.  The real deal between the two is the nipple.  The nipple on Avent bottles are larger at the base and firmer than the Brown bottles.  When we first introduced the bottle to our breast fed boy he did not take to the Avent bottles.  He just couldn't get comfortable around the nipple.  We switched to Dr. Bown's and he took to it with little problem.  As he got older and bigger we later switched and are currently using the Avents.  Why did we switch?  Cleaning Dr. Brown's bottles SUCKS!  There are so many little parts that all need special brushes to clean with that it takes forever to wash bottles.  Plus, the Brown bottles are thinner but taller and just don't seem to pack away as well.  However, if your baby is picky there isn't much you can do.  For expecting parents, I would not recommend buying a bunch of one type over the other.  Buy one of each first and see which one you baby is comfortable with.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"...I really wanted to get him used to the bottle so that I could leave him with my brother, and nothing else worked so I tried the Avent. Well, it didn't work either. My kid preferred the real thing. I guess the Avent doesn't work for everybody....",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I love this bottle.  It's sturdy and easy to clean AND it's the only bottle my breastfed baby will take.  We tried everything and she refused it all until we found the Avent :),5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"My daughter did wonderful switching between breast and bottle with Avent.  However, I am so frustrated with the leaks.  I have to screw and unscrew the top multiple times with a screaming baby in my arms.  Even then it sometimes leaks.  I heard how great these bottles were, I wish I would have known about this ahead of time.  The next baby will use a different brand!",3
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,These bottles are so frusterating! They leak all over the place.  The only thing these bottles are good for is mixing formula. The wide neck bottle makes it easy to pour the powder.,2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"THEY HAVE A GOOD QUALITY FOR THE PRICE, IN MY COUNTRY THE BUTTLE AVENT ARE SO EXPENSIVE, I LOVE TRADE AVENT",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I loved this the forst time I tried these bottles. I mostly breast feed and this bottle seemed to be the only one he took to. BUt I need to continue my search because he gets soaked as these DO LEAk. I have used them 3 times and since the second time he is soaked.  I don't wash them in the dishwasher either. great nipple, bad leaking. Too bad!",3
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"We began using the 4oz Avents at the recommendation of our lactation specialist, whose opinion was that this brand offered the nipple closest to the human breast. When we discontinued breastfeeding, we stuck to the brand and moved up to the 9oz size. The wide mouth is easy to fill and clean and I appreciate the clear markings in both oz and ml.We bought the first few new and then purchased the bulk 2nd and 3rd-hand. Our oldest models show very little wear - a testament to the quality of the product.Nipples come in a variety of flows (beware the multi-flow, however) and Avent even has a sippy-cup attachment to use later when our baby starts drinking juice. Overall, these were a great investment.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Boy, were we wrong.  I chose these bottles based on glowing recommendations from my veteran-parent friends who had no feeding issues with any of their babies.  Add to that the literature that promises that Avent bottles are great for transitioning breast-fed babies back and forth from breast to bottle and that they reduce the colic and gas in babies.  With all that, who could go wrong, right?  So we registered for multiple Avent products and seriously stocked up when our generous family and friends shopped off our registries.  Then along came our son.  From the start, he was fussy during and after feedings with Avent bottles and would take only about an ounce per feeding even as he grew in age and size; then he would scream and cry for a long time as if he were both angry and in terrible pain.  Classic colicky baby, right?  We struggled for about 2 months with these bottles and finally gave up.  A friend had given us her daughter's Dr. Brown bottles to try and up until that point, I refused to use them because they were so complicated with all those parts; we were so glad we did finally try them because almost instantly, our son doubled his milk intake, burped less, cried less, and smiled more.  This led to better sleeping and overall household peace.  Our daycare caregivers couldn't be happier either because they had to put up with all his fussing and screaming.  So given the choice to do it again, I would save the frustration and misery and register for a bunch of Dr. Brown bottles because they've saved my sanity and really improved my son's quality of life.  Maybe I can sell all these Avent bottles on Ebay or something!",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I nursed my son and was very nervous about introduing a bottle. I had heard about all these HORRIBLE experiences that women have had... from thier babies not taking a bottle, to having to trying many different bottles and so on... it was very scary. One day my husbad and I were buying a new car and I had the option of nursing in the bathroom (which was gross) or using the bottle that I had pumped for these reasons in the first place. I choose the bottle and my son had no problems at all. He was so happy, I started to pump more and use the Advent bottles more and more. The four ounce bottles are great for little ones. We love advent products I was able to swich from nursing to bottle with out any problems at all!!! Plus now as he's growing they have different sizes of nipples that you can use and these great sippy cup tops that fit onto the bottles....My son is still using them and he's six months old!!!",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I first experienced using the AVENT brand when my nephew was an infant. They were easy for him to use without nipple confusion. Unlike the traditional bottles made by Gerber and Evenflo, the AVENT are easier to clean...no bottle cleaning brush is needed. I was amazed at how my whole hand and dishcloth fit into the bottle. I never experienced leaking with them the times I had used them. They are also easier for the baby to hold.Any friend that is expecting, I get them the AVENT bottles and they end up wishing that they had registered for them.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,My son and I love this bottle. With this bottle he never experienced nipple confusion. I have used the Avent system for a year and my bottles have never once leaked. They are also very easy to clean.,5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"We recieved these bottles as a gift for our son (now 16 months)and expected greatness from Avent. When I opened the first package I was amazed at how stiff the nipples were that are included with these bottles. Stiffness is hardly a correct simulation of the breast. The bottles are also very wide and hard for little hands to grip when they begin to hold their own bottles. I also saw no indication that my son got any less air from using the Avent system. I MUCH prefer the softer, easier to hold, less air producing Playtex Nursers which is what we ended up switching him to.",3
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,These bottles are the perfect size and work great with the Avent Isis breast pump. I never had a problem with them leaking at all. You can freeze with them too. The 4 oz. size is perfect for the breastfeeding mother. The milk doesn't come out fast at all. Great bottles.,4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"We used these bottles right from the beginning (our son had troubles nursing) and our son loved them!  Our son experienced some pretty bad days of gasiness, but overall, no real problems.  We did have a lot of issues with the bottles leaking and found that having to change nipple sizes was a bit annoying.  A variable flow nipple would have been much easier than having to switch between nipples with different numbers of holes.  These were much easier to use than the Avent disposable bottles, which tended to leak and didn't allow me to push the air out.  Our son was able to hold these bottles by himself when he was about 6 months old, so that was a real benefit, and we also used the sippee adaptor on them which really extended the life of the bottle!",3
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"A nurse at the hospital recommended these bottles to us after I had my daughter.  They worked great for a few weeks, but then they started to leak.  When they leak, you can take off the lid and rub your finger around the inside of the rim to strengthen the seal.  It stops it from leaking, but it's a hassle.  Being a first time mom, I thought perhaps this was a problem with all bottles, but my sister uses playtex bottles and has never had a problem.",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have read other reviews about the Avent bottles, and I have to say that we have experienced no problems whatsoever with these bottles. Our son is now almost 6 months old, and the one time we experienced a leaking problem is when the lid was put on crooked. Also, I have never had a problem with them smelling like plastic or with the measurement lines fading. After nearly six months of use, these bottles have been dropped, washed, sterilized, soaked and put in the dishwasher, and we still have no complaints. Also, they are super easy to clean due to the larger opening at the top. We are so happy with the Avent bottles that we have even saved them for use with our future children. The only knock I give is for the 4 oz. bottles. I wish I would have bought only 9 oz. bottles because my son graduated past the 4 oz. mark quickly, and I feel that even purchasing the smaller bottles was a waste of money. Overall, I highly recommend the Avent bottles, but again, I would recommend only buying 9 oz. bottles.",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I absolutely love ALL Avent products... their bottles, bottle-warmer, pacifiers, etc.Both of my boy used the Avent bottles, and the ones my first-born used are still being used by my second one. Yes, sometimes there is a slight leak when shaking... I found that is from formula powder getting stuck between the nipple and the bottle, and breaking the seal. So, when it happens I just wipe the rim of the bottle, take the nipple out of the ring, rinse the nipple and ring, and then the problem's gone. These bottle seem virtually indestructible to me, and haven't discolored with age of anything. (Although, old nipples do discolor.)It's hard to believe my mom gave me bottles with little bags in side... what a pain and mess that must have been!!!",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I used these bottles with my first child.  I noticed they leaked occasionally which was frustrating, but I refused to buy a whole new bottle system when my second child came along.  I had about 17 bottles and liked having so many. I've been reading the reviews of how to keep it from leaking, and am going to try the advice of  Sherri M. Cottle Chelsea, Alabama) Her review says she called the 1800 number to avent and was told what to do. You have to put the nipple in the white ring and then put the cap on that and then you put that on the bottle and tighten it by the CAP..not the white ring...If you tighten it with the clear platic cap the white ring will stop when its tight enough on its own, preventing the leakage. She swears this works!After having to repack my diaper bag several times b/c of leaky bottles, I've learned to put the bottles in a ziploc bag.  Then if it leaks, you don't have a messy, wet bag!  (I like to put water in the bottle and carry 3 bottles in a large ziploc zipper bag and carry the formula in a dispenser.)As far as colic, both my children weren't colicy.  They were occasionally gassy.  My sister-in-law gave me the advice to put a couple of Mylecon (or I used little tummies b/c it's cheaper)drops in each bottle to ""get rid of the bubbles"".  I did this with both of my children the first few months.  It worked for me.Also, for the relief of my children's occasional gas, a friend recommended Baby's Bliss Gripe Water.  I googled it and purchased it off of the internet.  It's an herbal supplement used to ease the gas & stomach discomfort often associated with colic, hiccups, and teething.  [...]",3
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"We used Avent bottles for several weeks, but our baby was spitting up _all the time_, seemed like she was choking during feedings, and had gas all the time.  We switched to the Playtex VentAire bottles when she was 6 weeks old, and problem solved! No more crying from gas, she hardly ever spits up anymore, and she has a much easier time at feedings.  The flow is slower and it really does cut down on the amount of air she takes in during feedings.  So, I highly recommend trying something other than the Avent bottles for small infants.  Maybe later, when our baby is a bit older we'll pull out the Avent bottles again, but for now, we aren't using anything except Playtex VentAire.",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These bottles are the worst bottles because of the leaking!! They leak all over you and the baby no matter how the lid is put on, AND you shouldn't even have to worry about if you even put the lid on so precisly right. I mean it shouldn't be rocket science here makers of AVENT! SO my recommendation is NO don't waste your $$",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I used these bottles when I decided to supplement with formula at 3 weeks.  My daughter didn't really have any problems switching back and forth between the breast and bottle.  She is completely weaned at this point and doing well with these bottles.  I am glad I decided to go with the 9 oz bottles from the start, as she quickly went from 4 oz to 6 oz and I would have had to buy new bottles if i had originally purchased the 4 oz bottles.  We had some minor problems with leaks, and then I actually read the instructions that came with the bottles.  The secret is to reassemble the nipple/ring while the nipple and ring are still wet.  That seemed to solve our leaking problems.  I would highly recommend these bottles to anyone.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"this bottle started out ok until after about 5 months of usage, it started leaking around the collar no matter how tight the collar was screwed on.  this was so annoying, especially at night when you are sleepy.  you have to remove the collar and nipple, put it back on, turn it upside down and pray that this time it wont leak (after going through this a few time you will want to throw the bottle into the wall).  eventually you will get lucky and the bottle wont leak but for the next feeding you go through this process all over again.  try the playtex disposable nurser (the drop in liner is fabulous), buy the one with the avent-like nipple.  so far this is excellent, no leaks and no wash.",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I do not know what the problem is with so many of the reviewers' bottles here, but I have been using the Avent system EXCLUSIVELY since my son was born 4 weeks ago and they have NEVER ONCE LEAKED!  I can only say to prospective buyers that you should TRY the bottles first before making your decision.  My son LOVES the Avent bottles and goes from bottle to breast with absolutely NO NIPPLE CONFUSION.  I LOVE them!",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have used three different bottle for my 3 month old son now.  He gets horrible gas and avent bottles are supposed to help with that, but for me they dont. ALso they leak all the time.  The only good thing about them is that unlike the plytex bottles i use now, the avent bottles have several stages of nippples so there is always one that is the perfect speed for your baby.  Personally i have had more luck with the playtex ventaire bottles and the playtex nursers.  They allow less air to get in babys belly, but they only 2 nipple stages, fast and slow. Its good to register for several differnt bottles and let your baby decide which ones are right for them!",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I am breastfeeding currently but I do like to leave the house every so often. When I get the chance I'll pump directly into one of these bottles using the Isis pump. I love the nipples of this bottle because they are the most like the human nipple and my baby has not developed nipple confusing because of this. One thing that all Avent users should know...if you read the directions carefully for the pump, the makers tell you not to use anti-bacterial soap on any of their products. Doing so can cause the plastic to crack. I just wash all the parts as directed using regular dish soap and then sterilize all the parts using the Avent sterilizer. That too is convenient and easy to use.I would recommend these bottles to any woman who is breastfeeding and will have to return to work. Yes, they cost more than most bottles, but if you can afford that little extra you will be very pleased with the results.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"We used these bottles with my little sister 6 years ago, & I started my son on them (with breastmilk) from birth.  It's very easy for them to go from breast to bottle, I loved the pop-in cap for storage, and ALL Avent pieces are interchangeable!! I had to switch to Dr. Brown's recently because my baby has severe gas problems, but I would have stayed with Avent except for that. They're so easy to clean because of the wideness.P.S. As for everyone complaining they leak, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!! I read a recent review saying she didn't know why they left room between the threads that screw on the cap & nipple, the bottle info explicitly says this is to let air vent out, that is why they leak when you screw the cap on too tight. It just takes a light twist & it's on. If you've got a really gassy baby, go with Dr. Brown, otherwise, these are awesome for the breastfed baby!",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I purchased these bottles after hearing how wonderful they were. I breastfed my daughter for her first year, so we didn't use them that often. When she was weaned, and started on formula we started having problems. Everytime my husband or I would screw on the ring, milk poured out everywhere! There was no right way to screw the damn rings on... it was just pure luck, and it took numerous times each feeding to get it on right. The milk would pour out from underneath the ring (not from the nipple). My first thought was that I just got a bad batch... but I had bought them at different times, then I thought that the dishwasher was somehow warping them. Well, if that's the case then forget about Avent!! I don't have the time to handwash all her bottles, and if I did find the time, I still wouldn't.I read through the reviews to see if it was just me... I found many reviews just like mine. Then I found myself laughing at the reviews that instruct you on how to create the perfect seal. I gotta tell you, I put up with these stupid bottles for far too long, and they are expensive, so I held off on buying new ones. It felt so good to throw these in the trash. There is no need to have to spend the time on the ""perfect seal"", when there are other brands that work so much better! We finally threw them all out and bought another brand, Soothie, so far have been wonderful!Don't waste your money on this brand.*The sippy cups are just as bad. I've forgotten about them several times, and they've tipped on their side inside her diaper bag and they leak even with the lids on tight.",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have a 6 week old daughter and have tried using the Avent bottle to supplement breast feedings.  Unfortunately, I have found this bottle to be worthless for anything except storing pumped breast milk.  It is extremely difficult for my daughter to suck anything out of this nipple.  I too have found leakage from the nipple ring, making for a very sloppy feeding session.  I have since bought and used the Playtex VentAire bottles and haven't had any difficulties.  The shape of the Playtex VentAire bottles are also much easier for feeding.  I would not reccomend the Avent to anyone unless their baby has an impressively strong suck.",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I as many mothers did my research ino which bottles are the best and I read about all the wounderful things that the avent bottles do for the baby. I started to notice that the bottles were leaking. I thought maybe it's that particular one so I threw it away, only to realize it wasn't the bottle, it was all of them. When I contacted avent, they  told me that if the bottles are over tightened or if the nipple isn't assembled with the cap when it was wet that the will leak. I don't know about you but a 2am I don't want to be changing my two week old because her bottle leaked all over her. Please keep this in mind when looking at bottles.",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Based on a number of reviews in prominent magazines and literature, we decided to go with the Avent bottles. A pity I did not think of having a look on Amazon. These bottles leak bad. Tight or loose, wet or dry, old or new does not matter. Unfortunately we are stuck with the investment and are just being carefull when using. Replacing them with others are not an option. DO NOT BUY!",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I bought these bottles, and they are great!! I was also suprised to see amazon shipped them in bubble wrap to prevent breaks and the package was completly sealed in sterile plastic!!",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I agree with several other Mom's regarding the leaking bottles. It is so frustrating to loose precious Mothers Milk because of a leaky bottle or have messy sticky formula all over your kitchen floor. I would not use them if they had not been given to me as a shower gift.,2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I got my first bottles as a gift from a friend, the bottle works great, easy to clean doesnt cause gas &amp; my baby seems happy with it. BUT rarely, it leaks from the ring, which many just mention. The price is higher than most brand. I will suggest the sample pack that comes 1 X 9oz, 1X4 oz, 1X disposable nurser+liner, pacifier &amp; travel carrier for nipples for $ 19.99 , that is the cheapest way you can try it with min dollar...",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"My son is now only 4 weeks old and I have been using these bottles since his birth.  It seems that the more I wash and sterilize them, the more I get leaks in them.

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I use these on occasion when we are out and breastfeeding isn't possible. My daughter loves these bottles and won't take anything else. We have tried several different brands and these work great. They are supposedly designed more like the breast. As a OB/Gyn nurse, I would have to agree. Not once have we had a problem with leaking, gagging or choking that we had with other bottles. A++++",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have been using these bottles for my 5 month old since she was born.  She was breastfed for the first 2 1/2 months, but we always supplemented or pumped.  Now she is exclusivly bottle fed.I did have a problem with them leaking a few times ( as did my sister in law ) , but I just unscrewed the top and screwed it back on , and everything was fine .  Another time , the nipple had cracked and the formula was pouring out, but a new nipple ( upgraded to a 3 mth+) fixed that problem.  This is my first baby and the only bottles I have ever used , so I don't have much to compare to, but I have been happy with them so far and have just purchased my first Avent cup for my DD.",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have been using these bottles for about 5 months now.  I really like them.  They do leak on occasion for me, usally when I do not have the top screwed on right.  I find that if the seal between the nipple & the bottle is not right, then you will get a leak.  I solve this problem by just unscrewing the nipple/lid and then rescrewing it on SLOWLY so I know it is getting a good tight even seal.  This always works!",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I like the bottles but the leaking is an occasional problem.  I have just read the suggestions on this feedback forum and will try not to overtighten the bottles.  I haven't tried any other type of bottle so I cannot really compare them but I do know that when I do have to burp my baby, he seems to burp with just a few pats on the back.  Very easy.  I think the bottles have something to do with this.  UPDATE...  After using these a year now I can say the fix-all is indeed not to overtighten the lid.  I read later it distorts the silicon of the nipple causing the leak.  Once I figured that out, I quit hurling them leaking and full against the wall.",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I really like the Avent bottles better than others.  My baby had difficulty with breastfeeding and had to use a breast shield, so he was used to the plastic.  When we decided to try a bottle for wee hour feedings, we tried Playtex, but he didn't like the flat nipples, and I don't think he liked the latex taste very much.  My lactation consultant suggested Avent because of the silicone newborn nipples.  We used this, and once he got used to having a bottle at night, he took right off.  The nipples still require the baby to suck pretty hard without just pouring out, so I didn't have as hard a time with him going back to breast during the rest of the day as I did with other brands.  Also, we enjoy the Avent Bottle/Baby Food Warmer.  All in all, I think these are superior to the others on the market.",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"After reading so many reviews about leaking Avent bottles, I almost didn't buy these, but my lactation consultant said if I had to use a bottle, these nipples were the best, so I invested in them anyway.  I had read not to over-tighten the bands and to read the instructions carefully and to follow them.  I have done this from the start and have never had even the tiniest leak.  I love these bottles!",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I love these bottles. I really like them because it is smooth feeding for the baby.  When the baby is sucking it does not sound like the baby can not keep up with the flow of the formula.,4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These bottles are not worth the money.  I have been using them for about five months and they have always leaked a little bit.  Now they leak constantly every time I go to feed the baby.  You would be better off with something else, the Plaxtex Vent Aire works great.",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"We used Dr. Brown bottles for our first and switched to Avent around 11 mos or so with him.  Our second is now 11 weeks old and has been using Dr. Browns.  I was so tired of cleaning all of the parts and thought I would try the Avents.  The box boasted about new sofeter nipples, which I remebered being the difficulty with our first when we tried them.  I thought ""great!"" and purchased them.  Unfortunately our 11 week did not agree and they are anything but soft!  It is difficult for young babies to suck because it does not collapse enough.  The shape also caused him to gulp a lot of air.  I guess I will have to succumb to the bottle washing schedule I was trying to avoid with the Dr. Browns because they really did work.  By the way, the wide mouth bottles made by Dr. Browns worked better regarding the shape of the nipple & the nipples are much softer than the Avent.  I still think the traditional shaped Dr. Browns work best though.These bottles (Avents) also leak when they end up on their side in the diaper bag.  I don't see what the big hype is about Avent in general.",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I'm so frustrated with these bottles - they leak all the time no matter what I do with them.  I've heard the same complaint from many other new Moms.  I would never recommend these and will never use them again.,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I found these bottles to be very frustrating.  If the cap wasn't put on just right the bottle would leak horribly.&#60;br /&#62;Even if I did get the cap on without leakage, all my 5 month old had to do was bump the cap causing it to move a fraction of an inch and formula would be dribbling all over him.  Then I would have to stop feeding, take off the cap, put on the nipple cover and put back on the bottle in order to get it closed just right again.  The only reason I tried them was because I needed a wide mouth bottle with a medium flow nipple.  These are definately not worth the money. If I could, I would rate them a negative 10.  I find Playtex Disposable bottles to be the best......if only they had a medium flow nipple.",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"At first I thought these bottles were great but then they started to leak all of the time. I then went out and purchased a whole new supply of them thinking they were used too much or put in the dishwasher to much.However, it has only been about 6 weeks and they are now leaking everywhere. If you do get these bottles make sure you always have extra clothes with you and extra diaper bags. There is nothing worse than going somewhere and getting a bottle out of the bag only to realize not only is your bag and everything in it soaked you also have no water to make your hungry baby a bottle.",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I bought this at Babies 'R' Us.  Love the bottle but not the leak.  You need to correctly tighten the cap with the bottle or else there will be leak.  Sometimes, I have to tighten it couple of times before getting it right.  I wish Avent make it  more easy for new parents as it is very annoying with a crying baby needing milk while I was spending all the time trying to get the cap on tighten the right way so there will be no leak.",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,Intially I bought both the Playtex (with the bent top) and the Avent. My daughter didn't show a preference at first but after 1 week of being both bottle fed and nursing would only take the Avent. She is more comfortable with the nipple that fits her mouth more like a breast. I have had no problems with leaks or getting the lid/rings on &amp;quot;just right&amp;quot;. Now I am having to buy more Avent bottles and left wondering what to do with the other Playtex bottles.....,5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"My daughter has been using the Avent bottles for nearly 6 months.  We used them in conjunction with breastfeeding for over two months without a problem.  The biggest issue I experienced is making sure there are no ""crumbs"" of formula anywhere along the bottle lip or threads before screwing the collar on.  (Can be tricky when balancing a squirming child on your hip.)  Even then, I occassionally have a leaky bottle... so I test the bottle by shaking over a sink whenever possible.",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I received a really nice gift pack of Avent bottles at one of my baby showers.  The quality of the bottles is great, but they don't work for everyone.  The leaked horribly.  When I say leak, the milk didn't come pouring out of the rim or anything, but the nipples are an odd shape that can be difficult for some infants to master, causing the milk to run all over their face and clothes.  My husband got so frustrated with the amount of milk running down our 2 month old's face that the threw most of the in the trash.  I gave the remaining bottles to a friend who is having the same problems with her 3 month old.  I wouldn't waste the money on these - the Evenflo Ultra's are better",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Okay bottles. I haven't found anything that I like better yet, but I am still looking.These bottles do leak. I realize that it is because of over/under tightening. However, I am the only one in our family that can tighten them correctly. My husband, mom, and sister all cannot get them tightened properly. This morning my husband tried to retighten it 5 times before he finally woke me up and had me do it. Our car has stains from other people mixing a bottle. I find that unacceptable for a pricey bottle. No other bottles leak like this. My sister-in-law just gave me all her Avents because she is so sick of it.Also, my daughter (8 mos) is still on the smallest size nipple because when we switched to the bigger ones, she had a puddle of milk behind her head. We have tried increasing the size since then and had the same problem. But she is a fast eater, she can suck down an 8 ozer in 10 mins or less!In spite of the leaks and the weird nipple problem, I continue to use them because other bottles have other problems. Maybe I am too picky, but we can't find one we like.My baby also spits up a ton and also several hours later. We have tried other bottles and other formulas. Nothing has worked, so we may have to do meds.",3
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I have a four month old daughter. She receives expressed breastmilk in these Avent bottles when I am unable to nurse her. They are the right size for nuring moms. I can pump 2-4 oz. into these bottles and little goes to waste. My husband says they are comfortable to hold and we both know how easy they are to wash. My daughter does well switching back and forth between breast and bottle. This has been a great bottle and nipple for us to use.,5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"My baby tried these bottles and you could hear the air he was swallowing.  He woke up that night much earlier than usual and had horrible gas.  Dr. Brown's bottles are so much better and not much more $.  Also, the extra nipples you buy with Dr. Brown's bottles come with 3, and the Avent come with 2 (doesn't make much sense if you buy a 3 pack Avent bottles).",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I loved the wide bottle and the nipples on the Avent bottles, but they always leaked.  We tried everything possible and found that leaving the ring around the nipple a little loose helped somewhat, but didn't alleviate the problem.  My son always ended up covered in breastmilk.  There are lots of other wide bottles that work better and cost less.",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Everyone told me that these were ""the"" bottles.  So, we bought newborn as well as the 9 and 11 oz sets.  Here were the problems with these bottles/nipples:1. Nipples are too long and too tough...the baby would almost gag on the nipple when feeding and would fall asleep quickly because she was having to work too hard.2.  The bottles had a vacuum effect - every few minutes I would have to unscrew the cap and screw it back on to stop the vacuum effect, which would stop the milk flow from the nipple.  Every time I had to re-screw on the cap, milk would start leaking.  I followed the directions exactly and did not over tighten the cap, but still the problem persisted.3. The nipple flow was too slow or too fast.  My newborn couldn't get anything from the newborn nipples and would fall asleep from exhaustion.  We then went with the next size up (faster) and that worked.  Once she outgrew that speed, and needed the level 2 and 3, they were too fast.  There was no inbetween.4. The nipple flow rates work differently on each sized bottle.  I don't know what causes this, but she was able to eat with the 2 flow nipple on the 4 ounce bottles, but when she needed more food, and we tried the 2 flow nipple on the 9 ounce bottle, the 2 nipple flowed too slowly.Overall, my experience with these bottles was exasperating.  I felt like I was a ""sucker"" for falling for the latest fad.  I then went to the store and bought one of every bottle out there.  She went for the Playtex Nurser with the latex nipple (they are softer and more flexible) and has loved it ever since.  Haven't had any problems what-so-ever and finally feeding is a happy experience.One thing I can say is that the Avent bottles with the wide neck are perfect for mixing formula in.  We actually mix the formula in the Avents with a hand mixer and then pour the formula into the Playtex.  Also, we can use the Avent bottles with the sippy cup conversion pieces, so the money we spent on the bottles isn't a total loss.  We now have more sippy cups than we could ever possibly want or use!",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"As other reviewers have stated, Avent is great because everything is compatible and of good quality. The bottles will leak at times and Im not sure why...but I just readjust the top and it does okay. I am a new mom and wasnt sure how my son would take to Avent, but he switched between the bottle and nursing great. TIP FOR NEW MOMS: I thought I was done using the 4 oz bottles when he graduated to the 9 oz, but the smaller ones are good to keep on hand when baby is learning to hold the bottle on his own. The 9 oz tends to be too heavy for him to keep hold of, but he has no problem clutching the 4 oz - so I just make 2 for him :)(Also, buy EXTRA nipples! It really makes life easier. Stage 1-2 should last you a while. The Stage 3 nipples seem to run too fast for him still, even though my son is 6 months and is quite a hefty eater).",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I really do like these bottles. No annoying bags, or gummy nipples. They must be put together when wet though, or else they leak. It's no different than a manual breast pump..they need a wet seal. I wash them, then pop nipple through ring while wet. When I'm ready to fill the bottles, I run hot water over the ring/nipple and then assemble (not over tightening). I wash mine by hand (Pediatrician advised against dishwasher). I replace the nipples every couple of months, and I sterilize every few weeks to get rid of any build up.",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,Get Dr. Brown's bottles. They are worth every cent. They're the best out there!,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,These bottles are fantastic at preventing gas in my son but occassionally they leak. I tried to be proactive against the leaks by making sure both the nipple and plastic ring are tight but they sometimes leak all over the place for no apparent reason.,4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I started my newborn out using the Avent bottles.  After a few weeks, she began crying alot.  You could hear the gas moving in her tummy, and every time her tummy would grumble, she would pull her legs up and shriek in pain.  She would also pass gas constantly.  It was so difficult to feed her because she would cough, spit and cry the whole time. Then she would be miserable with gas pains for hours afterwards.  I tried switching formulas - didn't work.  Tried mylicon, Zantac, gripe water, bicycling her legs, etc. etc. etc... nothing worked.  The pediatrician diagnosed her with colic and said there was nothing we could do, that she would outgrow it.  Finally, we decided to switch bottles (I switched to Playtex nursers.)  Instantly we noticed a difference!  She was extremely quiet during feedings, didn't squirm or cry!  She began ingesting almost TWICE as much formula per feeding(probably because her tummy was too full of gas to take in any more with the Avent bottles!) and would go longer between feeds. And when she swallowed, it sounded different - you could tell that she was no longer swallowing air!  Something about those Avent bottles made her swallow tons of air.  I think it was the suction that was created inside the bottle as she ate.  With the Playtex nursers, the liner inside the bottle contracts as she eats, eliminating any air bubbles.  She is a completely different baby now.  She is more alert and interacts with us much more because she spends less of her awake time crying.So if you decide to buy these bottles - BEWARE.  If you are already using them and your baby has colic, switch immediately!  Don't just assume that colic is ""normal"" or will be ""outgrown.""  Babies don't deserve to suffer this way!!!!",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have given this product 2 stars.  It might be a fab bottle for you, but personally it was a nightmare for us.  Just make sure you have other bottles on hand, in the event your little one doesn't like Avent.  For the 1st 6 months of my daughter's life, feeding was a horrible experience.  The nipples are pricey & don't fit any other bottle.  My daughter got to the point where she wouldn't nurse from a bottle.  I ran out & bought some cheaper nipples & bottles and finally found one she would take.Yes, the nipple on the Avent bottle is more like a mommy's and baby does have to work harder to get the formula or breast milk out.  But there are other brands out there that are just as good (I personally think) than Avent.  If you want to be trendy...go ahead & spend the money. Just make sure you've got those other bottles ready, just in case.  I wish we had!!!",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These bottles are absolutely the best!  My baby used Medela, Healthflow and bottles given to us from the hospital and was gassy all the time! Then we tried the Avent bottles and it worked great!  No gas for the baby and slow flow cause I'm still breastfeeding.  I would recommend this item to all new mothers. If you have problems with the bottle leaking, you have screwed the cover on too tight.  I had to do some research on why it leaked and was glad.  Also the Avent Isis pump is great too!  I like that it is quiet, only regret I wish it was electric.  I have an electric Medela pump but still prefer the Avent Isis.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I can't even tell you how relieved I was to find the Avent bottle after my daughter was born!  I had purchased the Playtex bottles prior to her birth (despite all of the negative reviews) and found that all of the complaints were true- my daughter was unable to get any milk out of the nipples because the holes were so tiny and the bottles had so many different parts that needed to be cleaned.  After trying several different kinds of bottles, I tried the Avent brand.  She IMMEDIATELY took to this bottle and never had any problems with them thereafter.  She loved her bottle and it ended up being the 2nd word that she said!  I am so thankful for this product!",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"(This is a long review, but if you read the whole thing it may save you some money and frustration. If you just want to read the bit about the Bottles, jump down to the 6th Paragraph and read from there)I used Avent products with my first child (5 years ago!) and was absolutely thrilled. Back then, I was a solo-mother on welfare, so the cost was a real struggle for me, but I was so thrilled with the product that I found the money to buy the things I needed for my child.Five years on, and oh how things have changed. This time around I am married and have the funds to be able to buy whichever brand I want, without money being a consideration. So, I eagerly stocked up on all things Avent. I bought the 4 oz bottles, 9 oz bottles, disposable bottle kit, Isis Electric Breast Pump, pacifiers, Bottle & Food Warmer, Bottle Tote, Formula Dispeser, Microwave Steam Steriliser ... the whole shebang!The first thing to go wrong was the Isis Breast Pump ($US150 from Babies'R'Us). It would work fine for anywhere between 2 and 10 minutes, and then the suction would slack off and the rhythm would go out of whack, stopping the flow of milk from my breast. I would then have to turn off the machine and pump manually instead, or be left only partially expressed. I was reliant on the pump to take off my milk, as my baby would not latch, and I really wanted to keep giving her breast milk. When the machine broke down I contacted Avent and asked for a refund, as I was going to have to replace the machine. Avent told me that it was a non-refundable item, but if I waited a week they would send out a label for me to ship the pump back to them and then IF THEY FOUND A FAULT they would then repair it and return it to me. They said it would take 2-4 weeks. And what was I to do without a breast pump for a month, I asked??! The lady on the phone suggested that I purchase their manual pump to use in the meantime, and boasted that it would only cost me about $US50. Needless-to-say, I lost a lot of money on this, and was absolutely furious!! I threw the worthless pump in the trash and ended up 100% formula-feeding my baby.Then there were issues with some of the nipples tearing, and they were less than a month old. I figured this was just my misfortune, so rather than make a fuss about it, I simply replaced the nipples at my own expense.Next came the distorted bottles. I noticed one day that the plastic of one of the 4 oz bottles was warped. I thought it a little odd, but again thought that I had probably just caught a wonky batch and didn't think too much about it. Then another bottle warped, and another, and another, and another ... fairly soon I had 5 warped bottles (some 4 oz, some 9 oz). Enough was enough! I called Avent again and complained, only to have the woman on the phone tell me that I mustn't have read the instrustions on the MICROWAVE STEAM STERILISER properly. The woman asked me to confirm the wattage of my microwave, the amount of time I was putting the bottles in for, and how much water I was using (900W, 5 minutes, 200 mls). After telling her, she confirmed that yes, that was all correct, but she still said that I must have been doing something wrong during the sterilising process.The lady sent me out a label to send the bottles back to them for 'testing'. She said that once the bottles had been tested then they would get back to me. Well, while waiting for the label to arrive, I ensured that I absolutely was following the instructions correctly when I used the Steriliser, but I still managed to have two more bottles warp on me, giving me a total of 7 warped bottles to return!!I finally got the label and sent the bottles back. About a week later Avent called and said that the tests showed I had ""overloaded"" the Steriliser, and that had caused the bottles to warp. She said that ""as a one-off courtesy"" they would replace the five 9oz bottles. I pointed out to her that I had stacked the Steriliser as told to do so in the illustrations of the instruction booklet, and when I asked about the two 4 oz bottles I had also returned, she denied that they had received them (even though I put them all in the package myself!!) and refused to discuss the matter any further. So, I have lost 2 bottles, and have a steriliser that apparently likes to melt bottles regardless of how cautious I am about follwing the directions.The other things I have had issues with are the pacifiers and the Bottle Tote. The pacifiers had a hard edge on the silicone, which was very uncomfortable for my newborn. I ended up replacing these with a different brand, as Avent wanted me to return the pacifiers to them at my own expense before they would consider replacing them. The Bottle Tote packaging states that it will keep bottles warm or cold for ""up to 4 hours"". This is more like ""up to 2 hours"", but even that is dubious. In order to get the bottles hot enough to stay warm for 4 hours, it would have to be boiling water, but if you put boiling water into the bottles, the pressure becomes too much for them to handle, so that's not an option. I have ended up throwing out the Bottle Tote (which cost me $15) and purchasing a mid-size Thermos. (I put the water of about the right temperature into the Thermos and take empty bottles with me. I even use the Thermos at home, so that I do not have to wait for the Avent Bottle Warmer to hurry up and do it's thing at 3am!)I also have the Via Nurser Kit and addtional containers, but have found that the lids sometimes do not seal properly, and therefore leak. Very annoying, especially when you had pre-mixed formula in the container, your baby is hungry, and you're an hour drive from home!I am absolutely disappointed with Avent. Almost every product of theirs that I have purchased this time around has been defective in one way or another, and their cutomer service level has been absolutely pathetic. They have obviously never heard ""the customer is always right"" because the have continually placed the blame solely on me for the issues that I have had.Avent used to be a great company with a great product, and now it seems that they are simply relying on their good reputation of the past to carry them through the future. It's not good enough. Their products are NOT worth the money anymore, and I strongly recommend that no one buy any of their products. There are tons of very good (better!) products available on the market, and I will be replacing all of my Avent equipment with another brand as soon as I can. (I noticed while at Target the other day that Circo are now making 'wide neck bottles' that look exactly like the Avent ones, but at almost half the price ... I think I'll give them a go! Maybe you should too?)",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I recently had a baby boy and I purchased Avent bottles because I heard and read that they caused less air to enter the baby's stomach so I purchased them. I have not been pleased with these bottles because they leak. More milk has spilled on my baby's and my clothes during his feedings and I have never had that experience with any other bottles, therefore I am getting ready to purchase new bottles and they won't be Avent. I would like their customer service number to offically complain.",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Now I love them. The only reason I didn't like them at first was that my newborn son was sucking alot of air through the corners of his mouth while using these bottles. I think that the nipples were just too big for him as a newborn. Now that he's 1 month old, we are not having any problems. He has less gas now too since switching back to Avent.I have not had one instance of leaking with these bottles either.",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I should have read the reviews on this bottle before I registered for them.  I too planned on breastfeeding and was told this was the best for switching back and forth between breast and bottle.  I also had to stop breatfeeding and go to the bottle 100%.  I've tried every angle and no matter what these bottles leak like mad.  Most of the formula ends up down the side of my daughters face or in her bib.  Additionally my daughter takes in to much air and has constant issues with gas. I am now looking for a different bottle.  Do your research because it can save you a lot of frustration and money.,2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"We switched to these bottles around our son's 4th month - prior to that we were using the Playtex Vent Aire bottles.  Compared to the Playtex, the Avent bottles are MUCH better.  The Playtex bottles have FIVE pieces (nipple, nipple ring, bottle shaft, air filter and screw-on bottom).  Too often, when one of us would shake the Playtex bottle with formula, it leaked and we would have to take the entire bottle apart again to find the leak.  Meanwhile ""The Baby""(tm) cries like he hasn't been fed in four days.The Avent bottles leak every once in awhile when shaken, but I have found the fault is my own - I just don't have the nipple ring tightened completely.  Fortunately its a quick fix and the little nipper is satisfied much faster.  There are only three parts - bottle, nipple and nipple ring (four if you count the bottle cover) - so clean up is SO much easier.  These bottles can be washed in in a jiffy.  Plus, the size is nice - up to 9 oz., depending on what your kid needs/wants.  The size is also nice for holding the bottle - I find they fit nicely in my meaty paws.  Our son likes them too - he can easily hold an Avent with both hands now.  Overall they are nice bottles.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Out of all the bottles on the market, Avent bottles are the easiest to clean because of the wider shape. My baby also seems to be comfortable with drinking from this bottle. The most annoying thing though about these bottles is that they leak. I've tried so many techniques and sometimes it will still leak. One would think that Avent should figure out a way to resolve this. Aside from the occasional leaks, these bottles are perfect.",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These bottles are the only ones that I have come across that are great when breastfeeding as well as supplimenting. All the other brands I have tried my son spits up with and then gets confused when it comes time to latch on my breast. These bottles are a god-send to breast and bottle feeding mothers. They are WELL worth the cost, and are durable. They do leak if you don't get the top on perfectly, but nothing a minute of time won't fix. I recommend these bottles to ANY mother who is breast and bottle feeding.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I purchased the Avent system before the birth of my daughter. These bottles are horrible! Not only did they leak EVERYWHERE, but my daughter spent the first month of life eating every 1-2 hours from these bottles. She would suck and suck, only managing to get an ounce of so from the bottle during an HOUR of feeding! She would tire before her hunger was satisfied. Not only was she exhausted from these results of these bottles, but so was I! I orignally bought them because they seemed as though they were a good quality (hard plastic, etc). WRONG - Never judge a bottle by the appearance. Since this purchase, I've trashed ALL of the AVENT bottles and gone with cheaper (but more efficient) brands, Evenflo and Gerber.",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I am a breastfeeding mother but these are great with my Avent Isis Breast Pump....they wash so well and the quality is great!,5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have never had a problem with the regular bottles leaking.  Now the disposable ones I did BUT the only reason why they did is the fact I used the clear nipples instead of the BLUE flat edge ones that are made to go with the disposable system.  This product saved me with breastfeeding.  My son has had NO problems with nipple confusion and continues to switch between the AVENT bottles and &quot;mom&quot;.  I highly recommend this to any nursing mother and I will use it again with our next child as well!  All the lactation consultants and books say NOT to move off of the newborn or level 1 nipple if you are breastfeeding, the entire time of your nursing experience.  Larger holes in the higher stages could hamper your efforts of nursing.  GOOD LUCK!",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"The Avent bottles were recommended to me by my cousin.  She did warn me about the leaking problem with these bottles.  Even when I think I have the cap on correctly, the formula leaks out of the bottle soaking my daughter.  Several times, while in my bottle bag, the formula has seeped out leaving me with an empty bottle and a pool of formula in my bag.......very frustrating and messy!!!  On a happier note, I am also currently using the microwave sterilizer and bottle warmer put out by Avent and I'm quite satisfied with both products.",3
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I had asked for these bottles when I was pregnant with my son. I ended up breast feeding exclusivly and never ended up using them. I found out that you could buy a ""sippy cup"" spout to use with them. My now 2 year old uses them daily. They ended up not being a waste of money because you could use them for more than just a bottle. The quality is really good and clean up is easy.,5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"After having 3 kids now ages 9,5 and 2 who all used the Playtex disposable nursers by my 4th I got tired of always running out of the drop ins and realized what an unecessary expense it had become. I also thought my 3 month old daughter was too tiny to be using one of those tall 8 oz bottles, (which is almost as big as her) as opposed to the nice compact design of the Avent nurser. I figured my sister-in-laws all use them and I'd never heard any complaints so I didn't even bother looking at the reviews before purchasing my own. Well I wish I had because now they tell me about the leaks. I'm right there with the other reviewer who said it was &quot;not a leak but a pour&quot; I always double and triple check the nipple and ring before giving my baby the bottle and about 50% of the time either right away or halfway through a bottle it will just start to pour out all over the baby and me. As a mom of 4 it can't be chalked up to inexperience I definitely know what I'm doing. So to those moms who haven't had any problems yet good luck to you, but I just wanted to warn others it might not but it can happen. Just imagine what it's like when you have to take the bottle away from your screaming hungry baby so you can clean up the mess and fiddle with the cap in he middle of a feeding (believe me it is not pleasant!)",3
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I agree that these bottles are the best on the market!  I used them full time with my son, who is not out of bottles and I fully intend to use them again for my baby on the way!  All peices are very durable.  I love how you are able to interchange peices for these bottles.  I was able to use the bottles as my son's toddler cups when he outgrew nipples!  Not extra cups needed, just got the fittings separately for the cups!Unique and conscious design!  These were well thought out by PARENTS just like us!",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,Avent bottles are the best. I have used a few different brands and these just have the right flow and size.,4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Baby is breast-fed and I registered for these so I could pump and my husband could feed her at night.  Our baby hated the bottle and wouldn't take the nipple.  The nipples, on the Avent, are too long and hard and would make her gag when she attempted to latch on.  We switched to the Platex NaturalLatch and now she takes a bottle.  The nipples on the Platex are much softer and shorter.  Baby switches between the bottle and breast now, no problem.",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These are great bottles and a great system. We also have the 4 oz bottles, hand pump, storage system, and sippy cups. A little pricey up front but definitely worth the cost in the long run since the bottles ""grow"" with your baby. Very momma friendly!",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I used this system for my son.  He easily switched back and forth between breast and bottle, even at an early age, and never had problems.  The wide mouth is great for mixing forumla.  It will leak if you don't screw it on just right, but that's the parent's fault, not the bottle's! He never had a problem with gas or spit up, and transitioned into the sippy cup easily with the Magic Cups and the bottles being interchangeable. I am pregnant again and would never consider using anything else!  I am looking forward to the new disposable cups.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"My newborn was breast and bottlefed from the start because of nursing problems.  I started with the Playtex nursers with the silicone nipples and they worked great, until he got older and needed a faster flow from the nipple.  I invested a lot of money in more bottles and nipples with the Avent bottles (and Dr. Brown), but they were too fast, even the vari flow, leaked all over, and created too much air.  I ended up going back to the Playtex bottles and poking more holes in the silicone nipples.  That has worked so far.",3
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,this product is just great. these are the best bottles i have ever use,5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I bought these bottles on the advice of my doctor without reading the reviews first. They are great in terms of feeding/cleaning ... which is why I gave two stars ... but as many others mentioned they leak like crazy!  They are not worth the investment.  There are many other good bottles out there ... don't even try this one.,2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"A friend recommended Avent, so I thought they would be good. WRONG. I loved that they have a wide opening. That's great, except they leaked all the time. What a MESS!",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have been using these bottles ever since my daughter came home from the hospital. She was a preemie and was fed my breast milk with the bottle. She wouldn't breastfeed right away, so I used Avent bottles when she got home (she is now almost exclusively breastfed). I love these bottles and have no problem with the bottles leaking. Also, when I do have to give her some formula because of low milk supply, I put the small lid instead of the nipple onto the bottle, so it won't spill when I shake the bottle. These bottles are great, just make sure the nipple is put on correctly! Hope this helps.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These bottles were recommended to me by the lactation consultants at my hospital. I needed to get my baby aquainted with bottles for daycare starting at 12 weeks. I used both the manual Avent hand pump (which was great) and an electric pump. I started the bottle at 4 weeks. Both of my babies transitioned well back and forth between breast and the Avent bottles for 1 year. I did notice some leaking of the bottles when traveling with them, so I strted to use the small cap inserts. Once I was ready to use the bottle, I would put the nipple on.",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"My daughter hates the Avent nipple, she is breastfed and can't seem to suck on these nipples, even though she does fine with regular nipples.  I find that ironic since they market these as easy to transition from breast to bottle.  The wide neck makes it harder for me to keep air out of the nipple.  These bottles are large and they don't fit any other nipples or rings.  They don't fit well in my dishwasher baskets either.  They are just plain cumbersome, and overpriced.",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"For being AVENT - these are horrible bottles for the dollar amount.  I agree with the other viewers about the leaking and too big of nipples.  My daughter is six months and can not go to stage 2 nipples because it comes out to heavy.  They are very bulky and hard for my daughter. My daughter took to the Gerber bottles &amp; pacifiers alot better.  They are cheaper, smaller nipples and easier to load up in a bottle bag.  I would not recommend AVENT bottles to anyone.  Worst invenstment possible.",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,My baby loves these AVENT bottles. I haven't had any leaks in 3 1/2 months but maybe I'm just lucky. The bottles are very easy to put formula into and my baby loves to grasp onto the wide bottle.,4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I too was frustrated with my Avent bottles leaking.  For our daughter's first six months we would make her bottles at night and refrigerate them, then heat them in the bottle warmer.  They constantly leaked - and we did everything that was suggested to fix it!  We were about to give up on Avent.  At six months, we started using powdered formula and mixing bottles one at a time, as needed.  NO MORE LEAKING!!!  Maybe the leaking had something to do with the sudden temperature change on the nipple???  Now we love the Avent bottles, and no longer have to change her outfit after eating!!",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,We absolutely love these bottles.  We have tried several different brands.  Avent by far was the best for us.  The bottles do not leak as long as the nipple and collar are put together when they are wet.  The bottles are a little more expensive than others but definately worth the money.,5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I loved this bottles for the first few months.  Afterwards some bottles started leaking around the rim a little then worsened.  Gave up on them after several weeks of trying to figure out how to stop it from leaking.  Switch to Gerber bottles, they work just as well and they don't leak.",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"This bottle is overall a good purchase although there is a tendacy to leak.  It is best used by breast feeding mothers as a supplement bottle due to the smaller size because you rarely need more than 4 oz for the supplement.  The 9 oz bottle doesn't have any markings for under 2 oz preventing accurate measurement of the childs intake.  As with all baby products, diferent children prefer different things but in my experience this nipple does closer resemble the nipple of a breast and my 2 week old son agrees.  The wide neck is great for cleaning and filling.",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I heard a lot of hype about these bottles and the Isis pump. First off I love the pump!! The bottles are suppose to be designed for breastfeeding moms, but the nipple gags my baby. And yes they do sometimes leak. They do the job but are no more than average. I got a Playtex bottle just to see and they work much better for her. Now I use these to pump the milk in and freeze, then I switch the milk to a different bottle for feeding.",3
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,These are the worst bottles I have ever bought! All they do is drip and leak. I have tried over and over again and no matter how I put the lids and nipples on they leak. Since I am pumping the last thing I want to do is waste my milk. If I had to do it all over again I would not waste my money on these bottles.,1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have a newborn and 1 of 3 children....my second was very colic..so I did some research before this one arrived.  These are the best bottles!  No colic, no gas...yes, if the lid is screwed on too tight and the nipple gets pinched it does leak...an easy fix!  Just take it easy....  :)  Highly recommended from a mother of three who has tried them all!",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These are the best bottles.  I have a four-month old son who was exclusively breastfed until he went to daycare a month ago.  He had no problems making the transition from breast to bottle, especially since the bottles contain breastmilk.  My husband had the same leaking problem mentioned by others, but it's not the bottles.  He was simply overtightening the top of the bottles.  Avent addresses this issue on their website;""Why does my reusable AVENT Bottle sometimes leak?Leaking from underneath the locking ring of the AVENT Bottle most often occurs when the 'skirt' in the base of the AVENT teat is not in the correct position. Try the following steps:Pull the teat through the locking ring until it clicks into place. Then put the dome cap firmly on to the locking ring. Screw the assembled top section onto the bottle.Check that the top section has not been over-tightened. This can distort or trap the anti-colic skirt which will not allow the proper operation of the one-way valve.Wet the base of the teat before pulling the teat through the locking ring. This will ensure that the skirt will slip easily into place inside the neck of the bottle and form a seal.""",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"As one other reviewer said, they do leak.  We've found that if you unscrew the top and then screw it back on, it will stop leaking.  Other than this, they are great!",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These bottles leak horribly. Yes, I know how to work a bottle. They leak all over the baby. I would recomend Dr. Brown's wide neck bottles. So much less air gets in the bottle and the nipples are ideal for switching from breast to bottle. These bottles are supposed to reduce air bubbles? Yeah, right. Do not waste your money.",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"The good points...  easy to clean, no stupid liners to deal with, clearly marked nipples, correct measurement marks on bottle sides(surprisingly uncommon)The bad...  impossible to tell if the collar is screwed on correctly, until you shake it and milk gets everywhere, or dumps all over baby during feeding. Also slowest nipple is much faster than playtex or gerber, and tough for slow eaters to get used to.The screw issue makes these useless for me to travel with, as everything gets soaked.  Just a stupid design.",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I registered for the Dr. Brown and Avent bottles for my first baby.  I prefered the shape of the Avent bottles and the shape of the nipple to the long/narrow shape of the Dr. Brown.  And they were easier to clean.  HOWEVER, after several times of formula leaking onto my son's chest and soaking his clothing and neck and hair I started to throw away nipples and caps, thinking they were faulty.  I bought new ones.  Then I learned they leak due to the way they are screwed on.  What a hassle!  I now have twins and use all bottles I own--the Dr. Brown narrows and the Avent leaky's.  I have learned to live with the leaks (I always remember to check them before I give them to the babies).  But, now that Dr. Browns offers the short/wide neck bottles I would recommend them hands down!",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I only had thm leak once when I over tightened the top.  If you read the directions that come with them you won't have a problem.  I also got the sealing disks and use them to transport homemade babyfood to daycare.  You can also get sippy cup adapters...I love that these bottles grow with baby!!,5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I had thought I loved these bottles...but I have never been so dissapointed and frustrated ...2am ,my daughter is completely soaked!!! now she is starving,freezing,being changed and hungry in the middle of the night!!!they leak so much and formula is expensive!!! I want my money back!!!",1
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I really like these bottles.  I purchased a couple of these and the Playtex ventaire bottles after deciding buying disposable liners for the playtex disposable was getting expensive.  I like both the ventaire and the Avent bottles.  I have NEVER had a leaking problem with the Avent bottles and the best part is that they don't have as many parts to clean as the ventaire bottles.  I have stopped using the ventaire bottle because the parts are wearing out and beginning to leak... very frustrating.My son had no problem switching from breast to bottle, as I went back to work part-time.  He is now almost 8 months old and these bottles are still holding strong.  I will definitely be using these for our next child...",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,Just have to let you know... They leak.  My baby is  only two weeks old and these bottles are leaking all over him!!  Poor guy. He ends up wet before he can even burp!!,3
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"Not for my unhappy colic infant.  My advice to all moms, try an asortment of brands before stocking up.  I got the starter kit, and it simply is not the bottle for my baby!  And I hate that i can't assemble a bottle at 3am without leaking!",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These are the only bottles my daughter wanted to drink from. They have a nice wide neck so it is also easy to clean. I never had a problem with these leaking at all. I also love these bottles for when i would formula feed her. Again because of the wide neck, I never had a problem with any powder spilling all over the place. And the caps stay snugly in place. I also like the fact that they make the nipples with different flows for different ages so i never had a problem with my daughter choking, not getting enough, or getting too little.My daughter is now 14 months old and drinks from a cup. I still have these bottles, and i plan on using them for my son who is due in february.",5
Tumsle Mates Snap Apart Dish,"I love this product because it makes packed lunches so organized & easy.  I labeled each part with my label maker to help find any lost pieces.  I also like that the food items are not mashed, and my child did not finish it still looks good enough to eat when I pick him up.",5
3 - in - 1 Feeding Organizer,"I'm currently breastfeeding and I use bottles whenever I need to leave.This organizer was the best out there.I love the fact that the two baskets could be used for the dishwasher since there is a lid stored underneath.The down side is that you could only fit a total of 7 bottles.Avent 9 ounce bottles are not one of them(don't know about the small Avent),but I still put my Avent bottles in it,just won't fit on the bottle holders.Like most parents,I have more than 7 bottles,I store the rest of my bottles somewhere else.",4
3 - in - 1 Feeding Organizer,"We use a lot of different bottles (Avent, Dr. Brown skinny and wide neck, First years, parents choice, playtex, etc) and this will hold ALL of them with out a problem! Although I wish it were bigger because we have a LOT of bottles.",5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,"We purchased 2 of these seats and used them for over 3 years. My boys loved their seats, in fact I had to encourage each of them that they had outgrown them. We had no problems with them sticking or ruining our chairs. They did not fall apart. My boys did not pick at them or poke holes in them. When we were going to a friend or family's home for dinner these were easy to take with us. After 3+ years they were still in great condition and I was able to sell them. Now I have a daughter and I know I'll be picking up another of these when she's 2.",5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,My wiggly giggly girl sits in this booster.  For us it has worked much better than the hard plastic that is available in most stores.  My only frustration is that the travel bag was not shipped with the item and it was really impossible to figure out how to get one sent to me that I gave up trying to get it.,4
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,"Our toddler (nearly 3) has been using this booster seat for the last 7 months -- he loves it! We had a hard plastic one that he use to sit in while in a kitchen table chair, but it wasn't easy to actually sit in that and eat at the table. With the Cooshie Booster, he does easily and is at a good siting hight to eat without constantly dragging his arms through his food.One of the biggest features we loved about the seat, is that it has a continuous flat bottom. After our son was too big for a restaurant high chair, he started using a booster at the restaurant. But those are easy to tip over and get unbalanced, so we gave up on them. After we got our first booster seat for the house, we decided to get a second one to keep in the car for dinner's out. He stays put in it fairly well.We are planning to get a third one of these as a present for our niece,  Can't miss with this.",5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,I have used it for many years and it still is in great condition!  And it is great to use on kitchen wooden chairs with damaging wood!,5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,This product ruined my new wood diningroom chairs!It sat for a week on my chair and left a shiny residue that couldn't be cleaned off.I only wonder what is coming off on the child that sits on it.It is made by baking it in an oven in a mold.They say it is safe but I wonder!!!!,1
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,"I love the Cooshie Booster. This was the second one I bought and I did not wish to buy any other booster seat after my experience with it the first time around. My kids like it because it is high and soft, and I like it because it cleans wonderfully. The added bonus of buying it this second time was that it came with a bag for travel at no extra cost.",5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,"We purchased this booster after getting tired of taking apart our plastic booster to clean it every night.  Our son was a slob and dribbled his food everywhere!  We liked that it was one piece and wiped down easily.  I also love it for all of the other reasons already mentioned (no straps, ease of removal, etc.) He's used it for the past 2 years and it's worked out great.  Our only complaint is that the top of the back has split in a couple of places.  I taped it up with packing tape to preserve it a bit, but it doesn't look that attractive.  I plan to buy a new one when my 1 year old can get out of the high chair.",4
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,"We've had one for 1.5 years and it still looks brand new. It is used every day at least once. My 3 year old likes to get it down and use it in front of the tv, too. Now my 1 yr old is getting it down for himself, so I am buying a second one for him. Great product.",5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,"We just purchased this for our soon to be 4 year old.  He had to give up his Safety First Fold and Go Booster to his 1 year old brother who refused to sit in his highchair.  The product description says for use up to 4, but our 4 year old (40 pounds, 42 inches) fits in it fine with plenty of room to grow yet.  Was amazed at how well it stayed on the chair.  I have to admit I was a little bit of a skeptic.  Really a great product. Our 1-year old also thinks it's a great chew toy and he has yet to be able to bite a piece off of it (choking hazard, I know).",5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,"Forget all the ridiculous hard plastic, slipping, strappy JUNK for chairs! You will sigh with relief when your child plops down in this one. THANK GOODNESS there is something that works! Every parent that visits asks me where I got it. I have so many friends who have bought one after having their child eat a meal, or color, etc. in mine! GREAT purchase. You will no be sorry. I bought this off reviews alone, and I am SO pleased!",5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,"Our three year old daughter was ready to move out of the highchair when the twins were born (now 9 months). The cooshie was the best option, and certainly a wise choice.For us we wanted to have a booster that would be simple, no frills and amazing folding mechanisms, cool gadgets, and baby appealing features. We just wanted something to put on our chairs that could bring her up to the table. Well after looking at millions of hard boosters, with straps without, with trays without, reqlining, and folding, high backs, no backs, transformable, or one stage only... Finnally we laid eyes on the simplist one of them all, but definatly not the inferior model... The cooshie.It seemed so simple, like, ""thats it"", no straps to hold baby, no straps to hold to the chair, no trays, no back, no amazing features... but boy was this chair the winner of em' all!I loved that my daughter could pick out her own ""style"", basically a color, but that seeming meaningless thing, was so important to her! She picked out the purple cooshie (I believe they come in blue, green, purple, and red). We were also able to bring it to one of those stands at a flea market, to get it customized with her name and the cool letters, now she was ready to be a big girl!Well now onto the actual chair... Its easy to set up, because you just have to place it on a chair! We have solid wood chairs, but we placed one of those non-slip mats on it, after hearing how it ruins the garnish and finish of the wooden chairs. It doesnt slip, flip, slide, or wiggle, no matter how much my daughter moves, it stays put. I wouldnt recomend you using it on ahpolstered chairs, unless its leather or something that a chair could ""stick to"". The chair has no back, no straps, no trays or anything... this means its for an OLDER TODDLER, just as a seat so they can reach the table. Its not for babies, and I doubt I would use it any earlier than 2 1/2 to 3 years old, its just not designed for babies. You dont purchase a two wheeler for your 18 month old and get dissapointed because your baby falls off adn gets injured do you... no, because a two wheeler bicycle is not designed for an 18 month old, its for an older child... Just like the cooshie. Its an excellent seat though. Its like a big block of foam, thats covered in a rubbery material so it sticks to your chair. Its extremely comfortable for a child, and my daughter INSISTS on using it on the floor, on the couch, at her tables, and anywhere else it could be useful, just because its hers, and because its a big girl seat... something that sets her apart from the babies. We dont mind her dragging it where ever she wants (have even found it with her in the bathtub! It actually floats and dries really well, thats durability for ya!). We also found it SUPER easy to clean. We just lift it up and wipe it off with a baby wipe or something. I have honestly never done anything more, its not even like wipe it up and occasionally hose it down like some products, its simple enough to keep clean that way. I wouldnt recomend purchasing it for eating out though. The carry case it comes with is ridiculously large, its just a big piece of vinyl to lure you into purchasing it, making it sound portable. The cooshie doesnt fold, doesnt roll up and doesnt become any smaller than its original size, so its just carrying it around with handles... I would still purchase it, and have used it at relatives houses... but wouldnt recomend it for eating out... unless you dont mind the lack of portability.Its so simple, yet so unique and ingenious. I deduct one star because it does ruin wooden furnature (my mother tried to use it without knowing that it does, and her furniture was destroyed) and because it doesnt fold or anything for easy portability, and because my daughter finds it a bit difficult to sit on it, she wiggles around alot until she finds ""the spot"", and sometimes her legs stick to it (like on leather seats) and she cries out ""ouch!"". But these are easy to live with and minor problems, I would still recomend everyone purchasing it for your toddler.",4
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,"We love this product and so do are children.  We got this for our daughter who is almost 4 years old because she can not reach the table without kneeling.  This works great and she is so comfortable.  My son (alomst 2) loves it too but without straps and because it is hard for him to sit still, I would not recommend it for an active toddler.  The downside is that is slides from our fabric-covered chair so it is not the most stable.",4
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,We love it and most important our 2 yr old loves sitting in it.  Soft and comfy.  A must have!!!,5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,"My 26-month-old daughter would only stay in her high chair for about 10 minutes then would beg to be taken down.  Our regular table chairs are too low and she wouldn't stay in them very long either.  The first time we tried this booster, she had a smile on her face from ear to ear. The table was at the proper height for comfortable eating and she sat through her whole meal! She has never done that! The booster is made of a special non-slip material and it really works. My daughter got spaghetti sauce on it and it wiped right off.  When I bought it I thought that the price was a little steep for a foam booster, but it is totally worth it! I highly recommend it!",5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,"This was my second one. My first one was chewed up by the dog lol. I love it, it is easy to move around and my boys can get in it all by themselves. Easy to clean up to.",5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,This is the best booster seat. It ""grips"" easily to chairs and does not slide. We use it in our captains chairs and our son is great in it! It is the most durable seat too. My nephew has had one for two years or more now and it is still in EXCELLENT condition. It is soft and comfy. It may seem pricey for a booster but it is definitely worth it. It travels easy and wipes clean in a heartbeat. Grandma even bought one to keep at her house for all the kids! Definitely a must have!,5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,This seat is perfect for our toddler!  The seat does not move around and it is very easy to clean!  Our son likes it because it's so comfortable.  A little pricey but well worth it!,5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,I love this seat!  My four year old son uses it at the kitchen table and moves it to the den to boost himself up to use the computer.  It is so comfortable and portable.  It is extreamly easy to clean and the best part is it doesnt have space under it for food to fall.,5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,"When our daughter was phasing out of the whole high chair thing, we were reluctant to use those hard plastic boosters in restaurants.  They slip and tip and slide all over, especially when you have a toddler who will reach for things--and whose doesn't?We have used this booster at home on our chairs and in many restaurants, not to mention at family parties/picnics, where we can put it on a folding chair or other chair and she can sit up at the table with everyone without much fuss on anyone's part.  And the bag makes it easy to toss into your car and go and grab it when you need it.  Overall, we really like it!",4
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,Soft and comfy. Easy to clean. If it gets a nick in it or if your toddler is a biter it is easy to pick at and pull apart.,4
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,"My daughter loves her new big-girl seat.  She just turned 2, and the chair works perfectly with our dining chairs.  We also took it on vacation with us, and it came in handy.  This seat is a great alternative to the pricey toddler chairs out there.  I highly recommend it.",5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,"This is an excellent booster seat!  My cousin bought one for her daughter, so I decided to try it for mine.  Nice and comfy foam material that wipes clean very easily and is lightweight to travel with.  My 2 year old loves sitting at the table like a big girl now.  It brings her to a perfect level to eat at the table.  I have fabric padded kitchen chairs, so I keep a towel under the booster to keep food from ruining the chair fabric.  Highly recommended!!!",5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,My kids love the cooshie booster.  Its stays secure without straps and is nice and soft for their little fannies.  The booster is easy to clean and is ""stainless"".  I highly recommend the Cooshie Booster.  We've had one for over 4 years now and bought our second when our second daughter was ready approximately 2 years ago.  Both are still in perfect condition.,5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,"Love this booster seat!  My independant 2 yr old would not use anything else until I found this seat. He was over the high chair and other boosters I tried quickly and wanted to be a big boy. We have had luck with this seat for 4 mos so far and is nice that there are no straps so he can change chairs at the table if he wants to. Easy to clean with no hidden crevices, etc. Definitely worth the little bit extra it costs.",4
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,"This is a GREAT BUY if your toddler has outgrown their high-chair and wants to sit at the ""big person's table"". It's soft, easy to clean, portable, and durable. The only drawback is the price - try to get it around $30 or so and you'll be in good shape.Want to see a VIDEO review?

Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,"At first I thought $29.99 was a little pricey for a foam/rubber booster chair, but I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best.  We had a rambunctious almost two year old that was a squirmer in his highchair.  After it arrived he was so proud to be able to sit at the table in a ""big boy"" chair and eat with us, it immediately changed the way we ate as a family (in a good way). Within a week or so the highchair was rounded up and sent off to another family that needed one - and we never looked back.That was almost two years ago and he still uses his booster every day.  He can sit in the chair without one, but he is so much more comfortable with his booster.  It also allows him to sit much higher in the chair which is great.  It's also very easy to throw in the trunk for quick trips to grandma's.In the end this was one of those ""successful"" purchases (vs. the purchases where you buy those miracle devices that end up in the closet).If you are looking for a booster seat - consider your search over.",5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,"I have purchased three of these in the past and am now about to purchase my fourth.  I am buying it because it is the best thing on the market for toddlers to preschoolers who aren't quite big enough to reach the kitchen table yet.  It is comfortable, sits securely on the chair and is about the right height for kids 18-24 months and up.That being said, it does have a few flaws. The first is that the sides tend to break and rip causing a big mess (and an ugly booster) over time.  It's still functional, but rather unsightly. I'm buying a new one now simply because I can't stand looking at it any more.The second flaw is that the foam used seems to react with the finish of my wooden kitchen chairs.  Over time it has stripped the finish off all the areas that it sits on.  For that reason,  I would not recommend it for frequent use on fine wooden furniture...",3
Koala Baby Fitted Crib Sheet in Lilac Color - 2 Pack,I bought these sheets in lilac and pink. The colors are very pretty and they look good in the crib. The problem is they don't fit over all 4 corners of the mattress. I never knew changing a sheet could be so difficult. I have broken fingernails and scrapped knuckles just from putting on these sheets. At first I thought all sheets were supposed to be this tight until I tried a bedding set sheet which goes on easily and covers all 4 corners and sides. The Koala Babys aren't big enough to tuck under. You can see the bottom of the mattress on one side and I worry that the sheet might slide up. I won't even bother using them anymore.,2
Koala Baby Fitted Crib Sheet in Lilac Color - 2 Pack,"love that they're 100% cotton, soft and cool for baby.",4
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster &amp; Travel Bag - Green,Got this thinking we would use it primarily at friend's houses but its turned out to be really useful in our dining room too where it is now semi-permanently installed.  It's relatively unobtrusive when its in a chair and our toddler really loves it as she can climb into it and out of it on her own.,5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster &amp; Travel Bag - Green,I bought this seat after reading all of the good reviews here and I'm glad I did.  Originally we had one of the plastic seats with all the straps.  It was fine when we first moved our daughter from the highchair to the table.  I felt better about having the straps to keep her in.  Now that's she's 2 years old and used to sitting at the table we didn't need all that extra stuff.  That's where this one is perfect.  It just raises her up so it's easier for her to eat.  I also like the fact that you can pick it up and move it.  It's easy to clean.  I just shake any crumbs into the trash and then wipe it down with a sponge.  It doesn't have any crevices for food to get stuck in (we had to take the plastic one apart to get it really clean).  It also works well on our padded seats.  The plastic one used to tilt forward and we had to put phone books under the seat to keep it level because our daughter would start to slide down in it.  Definately a great product!,5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster &amp; Travel Bag - Green,This product is ideal!  It gives toddlers that little boost they need to sit up just a little bit higher at the table so they can eat comfortably.  It's very easy to clean and transport from one chair to another.  And it's indestructible - there are no pieces or straps to wear out or break.,5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster &amp; Travel Bag - Green,"My daughter received this booster seat for her 3rd  birthday and I think it's wonderful.  Every other booster seat I've seen has to be strapped to the chair, which allows crumbs and other food pieces to accumulate under it, and has to be unbuckled every time you need to clean under it.  The Cooshie is made of a non-skid material and stays put on the chair.  Since it doesn't have straps, it becomes very easy to free up the chair for visitors, when necessary, without worrying that there's a pile of crumbs (or worse) underneath.  It's also easy to take this booster to restaurants or other places (it comes with a clear plastic travel bag).  Other boosters tend to be made of hard plastic and can scratch the chair it's attached to.  We have oak chairs, so this was a problem for us.  The Cooshie's soft foam material does not scratch or leave other marks.  At 3 years old, my daughter was at the point where she was too big for the high chair.  She enjoys sitting at the table, but she's just not big enough to reach without kneeling (and she's not yet graceful enough to sit on a chair without taking a tumble every now and then).  The Cooshie raises her high enough without constraining her yet keeps her in a stable sitting position so she doesn't fall or slip off the chair.  It seems to be very durable too.  My 14-month old has 8 front teeth &amp; is currently teething.  He tried to take a  bite out of the Cooshie and didn't even leave a mark!  The only drawback I can see is that my daughter needs to be helped into and out of her seat.  When she was just kneeling on a chair, she was able to climb onto the chair by herself.  A little bit of a damper on her autonomy, but I think the safety and comfort of this booster make it well worth it.  I would continue to use a high chair or a booster with straps for a child who is too young or wreckless to wait for assistance in getting in/out.",5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster &amp; Travel Bag - Green,"We have a 20 month old boy who was getting too big for his infant seat but too small for a chair.  When I saw this booster online I thought it would be perfect, and it is.  It portable enough to take anywhere and he just loves it.",4
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster &amp; Travel Bag - Green,"Being a grandmother of a two year old, this booster seat is very comfortable for her, plus it puts her at the right height for the table so that she can eat without getting food all over her.  The carrying case makes it easy to take it to a restaurant and not worry about her sitting on a germ infested seat.  It's a winner.",5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster &amp; Travel Bag - Green,"We 1st got this seat for our son but we are now going to buy another one for our daughter now that she is big enough.  It is soft, comfortable and so easy to bring with you anywhere.  It stays in place and doesn't slide around on the seat.  Our son loves it because it's not a 'baby' seat and he doesn't have to be strapped in but now he can reach the table comfortably.",5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster &amp; Travel Bag - Green,"I am a grandma and have used two of these seats for my young grandsons.  When the boys come to our house they are so glad we have the boosters.  The boys not only use them while eating at the table but when they want to color, build Legos, or use Play-Doh. I highly recommend this product.",5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster &amp; Travel Bag - Green,"Not only does this booster easily go anywhere but there are no clips or straps to deal with. Because of the soft spongy material, it almost suctions to most seats, and is much more comfortable than any hard plastic booster. I don't have to worry that it won't work with certain tables either, (as sometimes happens with the boosters that attach to a table) because it can sit on any chair.  Both of my sons (ages 2 and 4) now have one. I love this product!",5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster &amp; Travel Bag - Green,This seat comes with a travel bag.  It is very soft and comfortable and fits nicely on kitchen chairs.  Easy to clean.  My daughter likes to take it onto the floor to sit on it too.,5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster &amp; Travel Bag - Green,This product is great. My 3 and 4 year old are still using theirs and problably will for at least 2 more years.These are good for any child that will stay seated without a belt. They are also good to move from the kitchen to the dining room without having to unbuckle a bunch of straps. They are also good because you can easily clean under them. I like taking mine to the resturant because it's clean and will not slide off the booth seat.You have to be sure you clean under them because any spill spreads under neath and will stick the seat to the chair. I also tilt mine to dry before I put them flat so they will not stick to hard to the chair.,4
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster &amp; Travel Bag - Green,"I bought a green cooshie booster about 3 years ago when my daughter was about 1 1/2 and no longer wanted the high chair.  It gave her just the right height for sitting at the adult table.  Then I purchased a blue one about 1 year ago for my son when he was just past 1 year old.  They both worked great and the best is that 3 years later the green one still looks like new, as is the blue one 1 year later.  My daughter is now 4 1/2 and still sits in it every day - and the blue one still works great for my son who is now 2.  Even the tote bags are still sturdy for when we take take the boosters to grandma's house. They are very easy to keep clean and light enough for the kids to carry.We changed our table and chairs recently and the boosters work well with our new wooden chairs.  Great product and I highly recommend purchasing these. No longer just a fad item, cooshie boosters now in my list of toddler necessities, and I've added them to my list of Good Gifts for Toddlers!",5
Mommy's Helper Drain 'N Dry Bottle Drying Rack,"I bought other more expensive racks. This one is the best. Simple and goes with all kitchen decor, love it.",5
Mommy's Helper Drain 'N Dry Bottle Drying Rack,"Perfect size; not to big, not too small. Pillars adjustable which is nice. I like the sloped base to drain into sink and not collect standing water. Exactly what I wanted in the product.",5
Mommy's Helper Drain 'N Dry Bottle Drying Rack,"This thing is pretty good for a bottle drying rack, comes with a little shelf for drying nipples, Sturdy, drains well, allows you to make different configurations in consideration of your bottle sizes. I like the size because it isn't huge butcan dry several bottles. COmes with a kinda flimsy bottle brush, will be a back up. Good product.",5
Mommy's Helper Drain 'N Dry Bottle Drying Rack,I had to return this product right away. It was way bigger than what I expected. It takes a lot of space on the counter.,2
Mommy's Helper Drain 'N Dry Bottle Drying Rack,"I would consider this because it's easy to install clean and keep the water from staying and getting all that gross stuff all over the nipples and bottles chose this one out of any other products out there, so far this one kept me happy",5
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Corner Guards,"Product appears to be well made & serves its purpose.  I use it mostly on wooden furniture that I have made, so the color blends in nicely.  Unlike others that I have purchased in the past, it isn't overly bulky, so it doesn't stick out like a ""sore thumb"" & detract from the appearance of the furniture.",4
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Corner Guards,"They worked very good for what I wanted them for, larger than I expected though so I had to custom cut them.",3
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Corner Guards,"Very soft and so needed for our two-year-old that races through the house and bangs into everything, and used to give us heart attacks everytime she nearly cracked her head on the counter corners or dining room table.  Very satisfied.",5
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Corner Guards,"My 12 month old pulled these off the coffee table one by one then proceeded to gnaw on them for the rest of the evening.  We have since removed the coffee table from the premises due to the threat of injury.  Please make a more reliable, childproof product :(",1
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Corner Guards,"These are nice jumbo corners that didn't make our table look too hideous, but at some point your baby's going to learn to pull them off!  This didn't happen for us for a while and I really think any other brands would have the same problem, so this one's the best in the market.  My daughter fell and hit her face on the corner guard and her mouth still bled, though the damage would have been much worse without the corner guard.  It's definitely better to have these than nothing at all.",3
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Corner Guards,I use these corners on my oversize coffee table and on my dining room table.  The adhesives have worked fine for me.,4
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Corner Guards,"This is a great product.  They do what they are supposed to do, at least on my desk.  My desktop/corners consist of a wood laminate, with a very smooth surface, so these things stick very well.  However, I have not attempted to take them off yet, and i'm sure a little 'Goo-Gone' or rubbing alcohol will do the trick when the time comes.  I will be dissapointed if they harm some of the finish, but then again you can't put a price on protecting your precious child from severe injury, which can easily occur when their head hits a table or desk corner!  For this 'peace of mind', I give this product 5 stars.  One more thing... there is NO substitute for proper and constant child supervision.",5
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Corner Guards,"I must have a newer version because mine stick just fine.  I have very sharp corners on the bottom of my kitchen counters and these guys do the job.  They are so much thicker and cushionery than the other versions (pricey though), but I think they're worth it.  No more bumped heads!",5
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Corner Guards,"I love these. I haven't had to take them off the table so I can't speak to the residue part, but these are snug and protective.",5
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Corner Guards,I used these to cover the corners of a trundle to prevent guests from getting hurt on the corners.  The fit was unconventional but they served their purpose.  The double sided tape was strong enough but I added some clear tape given the unusual application.,5
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Corner Guards,The Prince Lionheart Corner Guards work great.  I grew tired of bruising my shins on the wood corners of my bed frame that stick out from underneath the box pring.These guards were very easy to attach to the corner and blend in well with the wood.  Plus I longer get hurt bumping into the wood frame corners.,5
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Corner Guards,"When I was 2 years old, I tripped and busted my head (and needed a few stitches) on our living room coffee table. So now that my little boy is old enough to surf around the furniture, I was worried he would do the same.These foam corners are exactly what I was looking for. They're not overly bulky, but do provide enough cushion that he won't get hurt if/when he stumbles into a sharp corner. Before I bought this, we were given some plastic corner guards as a baby shower gift, but they were just a hard as the wooden table. Junk! I also like that the brown color of these thing somewhat resemble the color of the wood so that it isn't an eye sore.For the cheap price, and free Amazon shipping, this was a great deal. I'd recommend it!",5
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Corner Guards,Someone would have to work pretty hard to get hurt by a corner that these are adhered too! Anyhow the weak link in many of these products is usually the adhesive. Generally they don't stick good and end up in the garbage after kids knock them off or pull them off etc. These have been on for many months now and are still very secure. This is in a house that regularly has 3 kids 5 and under zipping around.,5
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Edge Guards,"We have these on the edges of our coffee table.  My 11 month old was able pull one partially off and I was able to see that the finish has been destroyed where the adhesive was, despite the description above which says, &#34;Adhesive tape will not mar furniture when it comes time for removal.&#34; We will now have to replace an expensive coffee table.",1
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Edge Guards,I used this strip to cover the corner of my bathtub.  The material is soft and sturdy so it certainly does its job.  I didn't give it a five star because the adhesive strips came off.  I've to constantly pat it to keep it in place.  I plan to replace the adhesive strip with a more permanent one.,4
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Edge Guards,"These are very soft, adhere very well if you prep the surface (clean with some rubbing alcohol prior to installing), and have a nice color!",5
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Edge Guards,bought these for my fireplace and i love them. they are thick enough to provide enough padding so my daughter is safe,4
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Edge Guards,"I ordered both the Prince Lionheart Fireplace Gaurd with two corners and the additional Jumbo edge gaurds as there were not enough pieces to cover my entire hearth edge.  I ordered the Beige for myself and the chocolate for my inlaws, the beige came in two diferent colours!!  Also the adhesive tape for all four packages was worthless!",1
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Edge Guards,"We bought this to put over the brick hearth located in our family room. (We too could not afford the ... gate needed to cover the wide opening). After opening the package I read through the instructions which stated that the double stick tape would not work on brick, but that we would have to purchase strips of velcro to secure to brick. After buying velcro and spending hours installing to brick, dear son pulled off each piece within 5 minutes.  Do yourself a favor and forget about these-not worth the [price] and time spent.",2
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Edge Guards,We bought these to place around the fireplace (much cheaper then the proper hearth edge gaurds).  The double stick tape just won't stick to the bricks and the baby loves to pull them off.,3
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",This works great.  It looks much better than the non-adhesive cushion and so far our 10 mo old daughter has not attempted to pull it off.  She actually enjoys chewing it as if it is a teether and it doesn't even leave a mark (she has 2 teeth).  It provides a lot of padding and most importantly to us it pads the corners of our tables greatly.,5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",Protects heads from sharp corners well enough. Little fingers are eventually able to figure out that it's fun to pull off though. Just needs to be re-taped.,3
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","Product is easy to apply & really stays on furniture, corners, etc. A great invention that no doubt saves lots of little kids from nasty bumps!",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","It's a great product, easy to put in different ways. I'm very pleased with it. Very useful to protect small child",4
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",So easy to install too!  I did the corners first so it was easier.  You have enough tape for every square inch.,5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","I guess these served their purpose for protecting the edges of our glass coffee table from our toddler.  However, I just spent the last hour trying to take this off.  I had to use goo-gone and a razor.  Would have ruined my table if it was made of wood.  Will not buy again.",2
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",worked great for a few weeks but living in a hot humid climate the seals eventually loosened up. very easy to use and install,3
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","I have used it on both a glass-topped table & wooden crib. It was easy to put on & has been very durable, despite the best efforts of my very active 1 year old!  Very functional & economical.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","We got this to use on a nice looking storage box that would hold toys, and look like it was ment to be in the family room. The box is a bit taller than the typical toy box and has sharp corners.  I thought we needed both edge guards and corner guards.  But after putting on the corners, I found the foam padding was stronger and softer than I expected and now we have the Edge Guards to use elsewhere.  Because of the length of the edge guards, even more uses may come from this.  More money to spend on the baby and we all now how much they want/need.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","This is very easy to install yourself, I put in in my camper trailer to edge a bunk bed. Looks great.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","My mother-in-law actually thought we added decorative moulding to our coffee table after we applied this edge guard!  It was a little tricky for my husband to peel off the tape paper and it doesn't go on perfectly straight/seamless, but we are very pleased with the superior protection this product provides for our toddler's little head. :)",4
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",This is pretty simple to put in place and not too much of an eyesore as childproofing goes. I'd recommend it.,4
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","I gave it only four stars because the item arrived with some of it missing,that was however resolved.The product does what it is supposed to.",4
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",We needed to protect the edge of our hearth so the baby wouldn't get hurt if she fell on it. This sticks really well to the marble and was easy to cut and install.,5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",We used this around our brick mantle and it has stayed in place for over a year now. Works great!,5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","I had another brand of guards just on the corners, which didn't last long at all.  This edge guard and corner guard combination has worked well for about a month so far.  The kit comes with excess double-sided tape, but I haven't had to use the extras yet because the pieces haven't come off of the table.  When I protected just the corners with the other brand (I think they were ""safety first"" corner guards), they got caught on peoples legs.  Walking along the edge of the table, when passing the corners, they stuck out about an inch from the table's edge, so you'd hit them, stress the tape, and eventually knock the corners off.  With this kit, the edge is totally covered all along the table, so the foam pieces all lie on the same plane, so the lack of size transition from edge to corner makes this catching on your legs less likely to occur.Prior to installing the foam pieces, I cleaned the glass with ammonia, then with nail polish remover to remove any trace of grease that would interfere with the tape bonding to the glass.  I also wiped the back of the foam pieces from the kit with the nail polish remover to remove any traces of oils or mold release agents.  It has held up well for a month, and this includes my 20 month old son climbing partially on to the table and sliding off of it with his belly pulling right over the foam edge pieces.  Overall I'm pleased with this kit so far.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","Worked as advertised. Great product, and simple to use. The fact that it comes coiled up makes the shape awkward and easy to mess up when applying to the edge.",4
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","I just put this up yesterday and was glad I did. My daughter been using the coffee table to pull her self up to stand and also been crawling through it to play with the stuff underneath. Just right after I put it on she was doing that! She even bumped her head on the edge! Thank god this was on so she was fine!Not sure how it would work on a walking/running baby into corners/edges. But this seem to be doing well. It's nice and thick.The tape that came with it isn't that sticky though. It makes it easy to stick and restick back on so you get it on good. But at the same time, I fear my daughter would figure out that she can pull it off.I'll see how that goes but so far I'm content with this.Cutting the roll itself seems a bit annoying. because I can't seem to get a STRAIGHT edge using a scissor.",4
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","Very cushioned.  They stick fairly well, but a toddler could peel them off if motivated.  I'm not wild about the brown color, but this is a case where the safety and thick soft material outweighs my aesthetic sense.  We have even used this around a rock fireplace base and it stayed stuck.  The longer guard is easy to cut for whatever length is needed.  I've reordered and used this product for two houses and I will reorder again if I ever need more.",4
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",We purchased these to cover the tile for surrounding our fireplace. We applied the edge guard at night....so baby wouldn't see what were doing and become interested and allowed time for it to stick! It looks nice and was super easy to install. Highly recommended.,5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","I got this for my 9 months old baby. No smell, thick eough for protect baby, and good double side tap.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","Bought this to cover some sharp corners in our bathroom, and I'm so glad I did! A couple days after I put it in, our little guy bumped right into that covered corner. No ouchies because it's super soft now :)",4
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","I purchased this table guard about a month ago. I feel that the padding itself is pretty cushiony (especially if compared to the expandable table guards) and I feel it would prevent a child from seriously hurting themselves if they should run into the table. However, I also felt there were a few problems.  You have to apply the four pre-cut foam corners to the table (easy), then you have to measure the rest of the foam, which is one long piece, to fit your table--and you have to be EXACT so USE A TAPE MEASURER (easy). However, cutting the foam was NOT that easy. The directions suggest you use a serrated bread knife - we opted to use a razor knife - but still ended up with some gaps. This certainly does NOT look good and cannot be fixed! The tape they give you to apply to the table is NOT very durable and I don't see it lasting. I don't know how easy the tape itself comes off the table, but I do know that the foam is constantly coming off of the tape. Plus small children, like mine, are forever pulling the foam off of the table - which IS very easy for them to do. My children are always playing near the table now since they enjoy pulling the foam off so much! Another dissapointment is that the foam only protects the top and sides of the corners - whereas I would have prefered it covered the ENTIRE corner (top and bottom) in case a child is reaching under the table and hits his/her head while standing up. Also, if anything gets spilled onto the table - which DOES happen with kids - it will lessen the durability of the tape. And you WILL get crumbs in between the table and the foam - which IS very hard to clean. Overall, the product is good and does serve its purpose.  I will definately keep the foam on my table since I feel it will help to prevent any serious injuries, but I am going to also be ordering one of the ""expandable"" bumbers to cover it.  This will cover the ugly gaps, prevent my kids from pulling it off and hopefully, my friends won't notice the collection of crumbs I have acquired since I have put the guard on the table!",4
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",This a great product. Also it would be good if you could buy plastic cover for the top of the crib railling.,5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","The guard is easy to apply with double sided tape that is included and easy to cut to size.  I wish it came with more corners though.  If you run out and don't need a new roll or don't want to fork over more money for corners, you can cut pieces of the roll on a 45 degree angle to make a corner if need be. The guard in brown looks good and not the eye sore I was envisioning.  It actually blends in pretty well with the decor in my house.  Overall, recommended for its ease of use, good looks and most importantly, added protection.",4
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",We purchased this NOT for a child but for my wife's father. As he has gotten older he getsvdizzy spells and has stumbled against his dresser on several occasions injuring his arm. This went on the edge easily and looks nice. Great product for a good price.,5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","works fine.  children proof, it's easy to use.  especially enjoyed the premade corners.  I wish there were a lot more of the premade corners.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",pretty good product comes with plenty of double sided sticky adhesive i am going to buy more right now thanks,4
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","I needed a solution for a sharp tile step down into my living room- every time I stepped down I envisioned my baby cracking her skull on that :( I was hesitant to buy this, though,  because I was skeptical that it would stick and chocolate seemed like the wrong color to match my tile. It sticks really well- we'll see how it holds up over time- and the color looks great against my taupe tile. It really doesn't look cheesy at all. We're going to use the corner pieces on a table of mine and I've already checked the color there too. Not great against some sort of reddish brown wood, but miles ahead of the hideous Safety 1st Expandable Table Edge Bumper. This stuff gives a perfect fit since it's cut to fit. The expandable thing doesn't fit the sizes listed (no way it will work on a 90 inch table) and it looks like a pair of hand-me-down training pants from the 1970s.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",The process of adhering this product to your furniture is most frustrating! There are no directions included only a few diagrams which are not helpful.,2
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","I loved this product at first (for maybe the first 2 weeks) until my son (now 11 months old) started wripping it off of the table edges. ONce it's ripped off, it does not stay back on well. I am looking into ordering mroe tape to try and restick them to the tables.",3
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",The Adhesive does not work well. Poor instructions on how to cut. I do not recommend this product at all.,1
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","I bought this and put it on my coffee table.  Shortly thereafter, my father bought a Safety 1st bumper for the fire place.  The Safety 1st one came off within a matter of minutes.  The Prince Lionheart has yet to come off.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","We have a raised stone hearth fireplace. It was the greatest feature of our family room until we had a baby. It is super easy to put on, works really well and I KNOW we would have had lots more tears, bumbs, cuts, bangs, etc. if this wasnt on our fireplace. We've also used it on some other wood furnture and it works well.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",These have saved my son from cutting open his head a few times.  I noticed the areas I didn't put on the edge guard he has hit his head and it hurt him.  Where there is guard he seems ok when he hits his head.  I will cover the rest of the edges now that I see it works great.There was one drawback - it pulled up the surface finish when I pulled off the tape.  I guess its that or it has a tape that will not hole on and your child can pull it off.  I'm not worried because I will refinish the table after he is older but it really something to think about.  Just be sure to test it before covering the entire table.  The table I used this on has a finish that is not sealed like those with a glossy finish.,4
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","it worked fine.  but cutting it to the right size wasn't the easiest and i was off a couple times.  it seems to be sticking, but my toddler hasn't tried ripping it off yet.",4
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","Sticks amazingly well and cushions nicely. The straight pieces can easily be made into corner pieces, since four corners go quickly.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","Easy to install.  We use this on edges of our concrete foyer entrance.  Last application lasted about ten years, so hope this one does also.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",I ordered this item for an employees desk.  It had a 90 degree corner edge and it was bothering his arms/wrist.  It fixed the problem!,5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","Bought this for my son who started cruising.  He crashed onto our table a lot of times and fortunately his head always got hit on the foamy edge guard.  Sturdy and soft yet it protects my baby's head.  Too bad, my son is starting to take it off from the table.  Anyway, I just distract him and he forgets about it.",4
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","I've been very happy with the Prince Lionheart foam edging.  It comes with enough tape to cover both edges of the entire strip, and the tape is a good quality 3M tape.  I have a large fireplace and was able to get around it with the 12' and still have about 1' to spare.  I cleaned the bricks first, and so far the tape is holding it fairly well.  I did not use the corners, but rather cut a &#34;V&#34; into the top of the strip in order to make my own corner, and it worked very well.  The corners were a bonus that I could use on another little end table.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","A lot of reviews say that the stickiness of the tape isn't that great, and it isn't- but so far it's not a problem. The guards are great because we have a fake stone fireplace so the edge is much more uneven than brick, but the guard works great. A definite for anyone with a fireplace and a squishy little handful of a baby :)",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",Used this on fireplace edge and corners to protect kids.  Very easy to use and took just minutes to apply.  Happy with results.,5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","While this product works as long as it is stuck to the table, the trick is getting it to STAY stuck to the table. The adhesive is terrible, and nothing else helps to keep it on. I assumed that I would ruin my table by sticking these on, and I was right. My baby's favorite pass-time now is removing the ""bumper edges"" and chewing on them. I would invest in the expanding elastic edge instead - kids still pull it off, but at least it won't ruin your table.",1
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",My baby loves peeling it off and walking around the house with it.  The protection is good but is not helpful because it just wont stay.,2
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","The corners are good but the whole roll didn't stay very long on my furniture, my 12 months old was able to remove it himself.",1
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","Love the ease of use, color, and cushions very well for my clumsy baby.  I have it guarding edges of my glass TV stand and it works great!",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","We purchased these edge guards just to be cautious but, once my son became mobile, we were thankful for these edge guards. Our son has clipped his chin, run around corners and hit his head and even bit the sides of the furniture when teething. What a great baby proofing item.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","I've used them on the sharp edges of my bed frame which costed me a lot bruises here and there. They work really well and the adhesive 3M tapes are wonderful as well.It measures 12 feet long, so I have plenty leftover as well. And I've applied part of the leftover on my iRobot vacuum as a bumper. Since it's easy to trim and adjust according to different conditions, it can actually make a lot of things. If I had to buy the vacuum bumper product, that'd be over 14 dollars and only dozens inches long. But this, I get 12 feet long for similar price.They also provide plenty of tapes, so I've actually used some for other purposes as well. I've applied the them about 3 months now and I don't have any complaints about the product. I'd recommend it to anyone who's seeking a protector.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","We bought 2 sets, used on window sill, formica edges and corners, and along mirrored wall edges... we suggest not putting tape in guard but putting on the surface first, then slowly rolling the guard over the tape in a straight line.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",Only reason why this is 3 star is its not good for protecting corner walls. My son peeled it off immediately and the wall plaster came off and he was trying to eat it.So I. My attemp to baby proof the corners I created more problems.I had to fix the plaster from peeling off and prevent him from eatting it. But I think this is the only solution out there to protect corners.,3
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",Provides the right amount of cushion. My son was pulling up on furniture by 5 months but was very clumsy. This product was great and came with lots of strong double sided tape.,5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",I searched for bumpers and found this product to be great! It comes In a variety of colors. I was able to match the other furniture in my home. Bumpers are easy to assemble and stick on the furniture!! Extra adhesive is provided. Great product!! Highly recommended!!,5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",The table was a little larger but cutting it to leave a 1"" space in the center of each length works great.  The triplets climb all over the living and always come back to the table to play.  It looks good and you don't even notice its there.,5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","I love the idea of this product.  It is what I wanted to protect my sons head when he falls.  I put it on my coffee table and TV stand because my son loves to stand and put his toys on them.  I also put them on when he was at his Grandmothers home for the day, as soon as he got home and his daddy put him down My son messed with them and they came off.  BUT not only did the come off they also took a layer of my table with it! SO UPSET will be looking for another product.",2
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",Shipped in nice original box.Four corner plus the long strip - as described.A nice touch is the double-sided-tape is 3M and not some cheap fall-off-next-week tape.,5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","The product comes with several strips of 3M double tape, which seems tp have a lot of strength. My one year old has tried to pull it off the table and has not had success. Compared the the Kidkusion I bought for the fireplace, this one has a much stronger bond when applied.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",Good idea but this is very cheaply made... it is not sticky enough to stay on anything... my 6 month old baby would just yank it off immediately. I wish I never purchased this because you'd basically have to crazy glue to your furniture and there's no way I am doing that!,1
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","Easy to put on, but sometimes easy to come off!  The only problem we have had is with the cornors.  2 of the 4 have come off in 5 months time, which isn't too bad.  My son pulled one off and the other one came off because with getting up and down from the couch we bumped it a lot and it came off.  Rest of it has stuck great, but we make sure we keep little hands from pulling it off!  One thing we were worried about was the finish on our coffee table, but the tape is great and doesn't take any of the finish off, which makes us feel a lot better!  Still better then the ones that have elastic in them, those are very easy to take off, but I wish this product would either come with stickier tape, or extra tape!",4
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","Used this to cover the sharp edge of my stone fireplace mantel's base.  Cleaned the edges, and was skeptical of the tape sticking to the stone, but it did marvelously!  There's enough double-stick tape to tape down one side of the guard in a long continuous manner, but if you're planning on trying to tape down both sides, you'll have to ration the tape.I wouldn't call this grey.  it's more of a beige/tan.  grey to me is somewhere between black and white; this is basically a very very light brown.For what I needed it for, it was perfect.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","I used this to guard the natural tiles around my fireplace. I was skeptical that it would stick to the stone, but is has stayed in place very well, even if the stone tiles are a little jagged. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone trying ad safety cushion to any edge of their home including furniture.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","I have these things all over the house on sharp edges. They work very well, and are definitely worth the $ to protect your little ones.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","We used this for our fireplace hearth and so far, the double sided tape is still firmly attached to the brick, even when our 9 month old grabs on it and pulls at it. (We installed it about a month and a half ago, so time will tell.) The foam is durable but also very soft and cushiony. The brown color goes well with our brick and doesn't draw attention in an obnoxious &#34;I am child proofing this fireplace&#34; kind of way.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","Easy to put up, takes a bit of time, but overall fairly easy!  Wasn't too crazy about the type of adhesive that comes with it, but I look at it this way.... I'd rather re-finish my wood coffee tabble than deal with all the boo-boos and broken teeth it(my coffee table) has caused! (I have three kiddos and this coffee table has taken a tooth from two of them before they were 2yrs old)  I'm hoping this protector will prevent that with my third little one! Personally I hate this coffee table, but my husband will not get rid of it... I put this protector on my fire place too, and it looks and feels wonderful.  I like that it streches a bit, and I had plenty of adhesive left over! I rate this product 4 stars, definitely worth the price just know that adhesive is going to be a consern when I remove the product!",4
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","As many others have written this product is NOT safe for wood furniture.  Whe we removed it it actually pulled the finish off of a brand new Crate and Barrell table we had.  Using several different solvents, a nylon pot scraper, about two rolls of paper towels, and a LOT of elbow grease I was able to get the massive amount of remaining adhesive off without doing further damage.  Although the company does include a short disclaimer about how they are not liable for damage to tables, elswhere in the packaging materials it clearly states that the product CAN be used on wood furniture.  They even show the product on a wood table in their advertising! I can't state emphatically enough that this product WILL damage your table - only use it on wood furniture you don't care about.",1
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","Love them. it's very flexible that you can place it anywear, curve or striaght. And the sticker is strong enought that they won't peel off.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",Perfect choice to protect my grandsons face!!! Haven't had him cry since I put it on. Than you Prince lion heart!!!,5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","I bought this to cover a tile edge in my step-down living room and to line my daughters window sills since they are only 6 inches from the ground. The padding is great and really protects her from bumping the edges, but she can pull it off very easily. Now she just tries to pull it off and chew on it, so we are costantly re-applying it. But it has helped prevent many bumps and bruises along the way.",3
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","I ordered 2 packages in order to cover the appropriate circumference of 1 coffee table and the front edges of two end tables. When the package arrived the length of edging was 7'6"", not 12' as advertised. That means I was completely short and could not complete my project. Aside from the lack of length, the product works well and seems secure. I would have ordered more had I known about the length. It's quite a disparity between 7' and 12', so purchase appropriately.",3
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","we used this on our fireplace stone edge (which was extremely nerve wrecking) and it works wonderfully, I saw a complaint about kids being able to pull this off on one of the reviews, I have not had this problem, my kids listen very well, but it may be a different story if I had it on my table where they spend time doing anything they can to avoid eating.I have a 2 and 4 year old",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",This blends well with our coffee table and kept my little one safe. The real test will be when we take it off - will it peal off the wood from the furniture ?,4
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","My kids can easily pull these off of our wooden coffee table, but we've taught them not to.  We have avoided a couple of head injuries thanks to them, so I'm glad we bought them.",3
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",,2
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",my baby has been not intrigued enough to pull this out. I have it even on the wall corners in my house. It has given me more peace of mind to let him walk without worrying too much.I have brown ones on my wood so it looks better.,5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","While the cushion does work as advertised in softening sharp edges and corners, both putting the cushions onto sharp edges and then taking them off were terrible. A) attaching the tape and cushions - the tape should be attached to the cushioning at the factory to avoid spending so much time attaching tape to cushion.  B) removing the cushions and the tape from glass table tops is practically impossible - it is taking hours to get it even remotely clean.",1
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","it may never come off...even when we want it to.it's durable foam. i was worried that baby might be able to bite off a piece and choke, but you can't. i tried.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",Quite simply this product does what it says.  I accidentally ordered 2 packs and in brown but I like it anyway.  Just gives me peace of mind to now that if my daughter should bump into a table corner the blow will be cusioned,5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","We have a brick fireplace. Couldn't do without this stuff.I thought it was unnecessary precaution but wow, we've had several head hits per week. I'd hate to think of the consequences of some of those bonks and falls without this stuff.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","When you first put this on the table you feel like it has made things safer for your child, however the first time they get near it they are able to pull it off because the adhesive provided with it doesn't hold well unless you have a completely flat surface to attach it to.  (I suppose if you use a stronger adhesive you would run the risk of damaging the table).Only buy if you have a large top face and edge to the table with no decorative surface changes (must be completely flat to hold at all)",1
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",The color was true and the product is great. A piece of cake to install. I bought from a different company that sells this kind of product at a longer length but never received the color that was actually pictured after multiple correspondences/ transactions. I feel they are misrepresenting it on purpose as a bait and switch so buyer beware there. You get what you pay for here.,5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","This product is what to use between the corner guards, and is easily cut to an exact fit with an Exacto knife.The self adhesive means no clean-up afterwards.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","Easy to use, easy to apply.  I did one end table and two window sills with the edge guard.  It cuts easily and the two-sided tape is very thin and easy to peel and stick.  My toddler grandson tries to pick the corners off of the table and he can't budge them.  This is exactly what I needed to protect him.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",We used this to cover the edge of some tile rather than a table.  I only wished I would have done it sooner to prevent one injury.  It was easy to install and adhesive is still in place and working well!,5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","This product did not work well.  Both of my kids were able to easily rip the corner pieces off.  And today,after becoming tired of placing them on over and over again for months, I took it all off, just to find that I can't get large chunks of it - or the adhesive - off of my table.  Do Not Buy!!",1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"This is the very best potty seat!  I wish I'd had it when my younger boys were potty training.  I love how it has an adjustment on the bottom so it can fit any kind of toilet seat.  No worries about my son slipping & falling in the potty.  Yes, it's $$$ but so very worth it.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,I bought one of the foam ones for my 3 year old . It worked great till it started stinking. I would spray it with bleach and the smell still didn't go away. I found this on Amazon and decided to give it a try. I love it . It is easy to use and stays put. The best thing is that it doesn't stink and easy to keep clean.,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,This is the best potty seat by far.  I have 2 boys and I never have a wet mess after they use this seat.  I bought other seats but they always left a wet ring around the rim and I had to rinse the seat and their legs every time.  I never worry about a mess with this seat. Worth every penny.,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"My nearly 3 year old daughter had been rejecting 2 different potty chairs, and was hesitant to sit on the ""big potty"" after nearly falling in the water.  This toilet trainer sits securely on my elongated toilet bowl and is very stable when she climbs on and off, easing her fears.  I am very pleased with it and would recommend it highly.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,I think this is my first time actually writing a review.  I always read them but never take the time to leave feedback.  I purchased this based on all the good reviews that it received and I couldn't be happier.  We have an elongated toilet and it was very hard to find a potty seat that fit it.  This is the only one that I have found to fit perfectly. So glad I bought it!,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"It is perfect and is worth every penny. Easy to clean, adjustable, and my child can put it on/take it off without assistance, which makes my life so much easier! Definitely 5 stars!",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"When my daughter first showed an interest in using the toilet, I bought one of those cheap toppers from Walmart. After a couple months I realized that it was starting to fall apart. The handles started to come off and then the seat started to tear exposing the foam on the seat. It was really gross...Then I realized that I should of invested some money for the Baby Bjorn toilet trainer I originally wanted.My daughter was so excited to use her new toilet trainer when it came in the mail!She ripped the box open and ran to the bathroom to try it out. She loved it so much she would not get off the toilet.I really love the quality of this product.There is no tearing foam or handles that will eventually fall off, cleaning is a breeze, and it adjusts to different toilets. So it's great to take on vacations! Oh most importantly since I just had another child she can also use it in the future without it falling apart! Definitely a good investment!",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"safe, sturdy and non-bulky toilet seat. My toddler now feels confident to climb onto toilet seat on her own - our previous training seat moved around so was very difficult to get onto. Easy to take travelling too.",4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"I saw some other reviews saying that they had issues with some other slow closing seats.  Our son hasn't used this yet, but I wanted to say that this fits our toilet seat PERFECTLY - it's VERY stable!!!  Our seat and toilet have an elongated shape - not round.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"My only complaint is that the dial to tighten the seat onto the toilet keeps jerking back, preventing the seat from being truly secure. However, we are still using it and it doesn't move when my son is on it",3
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"We like simple designs, things that look as normal as possible, considering what it is!  My kid didn't need a pink polka dot toilet seat to want to toilet train, but if that would help yours, by all means get the pink one!  I say whatever makes the process easier is what you should do.  That is why I purchased a total of 3 of these when I realized my daughter preferred these to the little stand alone potties.  Suddenly it became important to have one on each floor of our house, and one in a travel bag that we keep in the car.  We just use a large tote bag when we go out and use this on public toilets, then clorox wipe it down afterwards.  From our research, those portable ones are flimsy, often don't fit correctly, pinch tiny tushies, etc., etc.  So we've found this to work well on just about every toilet out there, and it's reliably sturdy and familiar for our kid to feel at ease whenever and wherever she may need to use it.  So with 3 of these items, you could say we are fans.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"My little girl can sit on here just fine and it even fits a German toilet!!!! I am very impressed with the seat itself. I give it 4 stars because I think the price is a little outrageous. I also left a review for the seller, I paid a hefty amount in shipping and it took literally FOREVER to get it here. The matching stool arrived almost 2 weeks before the toilet did.",4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"We're struggling with potty training our 3yo boy and these potty seats have been great! They are all one piece so there aren't any cracks and crevices that you have to clean, and they are contoured perfect for his little bottom.  There is a handle on the back so it's very easy for adults and kids to lift it off of the toilet, and then you just drop it back into place when your little one needs to go potty.  My sister recommended them to me (she's already trained two kiddos) and we've been truly impressed - as impressed as one can be with a potty trainint seat that is! (wink)",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"this has been such a great thing for our family. no more cleaning little toilets, yeah.. i definitely recommend this to anyone... also get a stool of some sorts so they can get on it themselves.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"We bought this for our grandson, one for his home and one for ours in hopes of getting him to want to go on the toilet and rid him of his diapers.  He is now just over 2 and no luck so far but we like the seat and we are sure he will some day soon.",4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Love this seat.  With the cheaper seats w/ Disney designs, etc, the pee was always getting everywhere but the potty.  This is perfect for my son.  The bump between the thighs keeps his legs apart so pee gets IN the potty instead of on it and it is deep enough so that even if the pee does not go straight down and still gets in the potty and does not leak under the seat.  Fits well on our toilet seat.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Yes I am trying the impossible of early potty training with my 13 month old.  This seems well built but just in case anyone was wondering, a little too big for a 75%ile 1 year old",3
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"I love this seat. I have two in my house and this one is my favorite. The kids say it's comfortable and it adjusts to fit the seat. Which is great, since we actually have a round seat in one bathroom and an oval one in the other. I keep this one in the main bathroom, since it's the favorite. Definitely recommend this to anyone who has smaller butts (you know, children) in the house.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"We had a cheapo toilet-top seat before this -- it was messy, pee shield too low, had a rough edge which hurt my son. This cost two-three times as much, but MAN is it better! It's awesome -- easy to clean, pee shield tall but safe, comfy for him to sit on... and we're finally making potty training progress! I HIGHLY recommend this seat.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,This seat fits any toilet and is easy to install.  The compact size allows for travel.  The red handle makes it easy for toddlers to remove from toilet.,4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Wow! We have had this for two weeks and she is potty trained.  We had tried everything, but this was the one.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Great for little bottoms and adjusts to fit toilet seats.  Lightweight, easy to clean and the toddlers seem comfortable.  recommend",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"This is a great product.  I am currently using it for my 20 month son.  He has a little trouble climbing on to the toilet using a step stool, but when he gets up there he is very comfortable.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"This is my toddler's go to for potty time.  He bypasses the two other small potties I have in the house, to sit on this, on the big toilet.  I put a step stool under his feet to keep him more comfortable.  It's great!",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,My daughter was scared of falling in the toilet when she first started potty training.  She was so scared that she would wait until the very last second to go and she would have accidents because of it.  With this training seat she fit perfectly and her fear was over.  We ended up purchasing 3 of these because they worked so well.I am only giving it four starts though because we did find that she would hurt her booty and &#34;parts&#34; some times when she would try to slide up on it.  I understand why the bump in the front is there (to stop kids from peeing out the front of it) but if it could be made with a softer material (at least on the front) it might make it easier and less painful for kids to get on and off of.,4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"My 20 month daughter started to say 'pee pee' whenever she wanted a diaper change. We found she wants the diaper change when she was about to pee (or poo) when her diaper is already heavy and she does not like to wet the carpet or the blanket. So I thought maybe it's not so early for her to start potty training.We got this Babybjorn toilet trainer delivered, and tried to put on the toilet - and as a curious toddler as she is, she asked me to put her on it (in her own language) then started peeing and she even tried to clean with tissues (she just dumps the tissue - I think she caught that from her big sister). Since then, she tries to stay away from diapers whenever she's not traveling or sleeping.She's on the heavier side at 30 lb. She sits on it very comfortably alone, but smaller babies might have to find a smaller stand alone type potty trainer bowl.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"This toilet trainer is great! It's sturdy, secure, no folding up parts, which means there's no chance of pinching tiny bottoms! It's sleek enough to fit in the diaper bag without a lot of fuss, so I sometimes take it on the road with us. I highly recommend it.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"I initially bought this potty seat based on reviews that said it was good for a boy.  It seemed a bit pricey, but was cheaper at amazon.com than anywhere else.  My main objective with this was for my son to poop on the toilet.  He has constipation issues, so I thought a potty would be easier for him than trying to poop in his diaper.  He does what we call a ""poop dance"" so we always know when he has to go.  His little bottom fits well on this seat, and he uses it with ease.  The shield in front is sufficient.  We have not had any accidents yet.  Common sense says to keep his boy parts pointed down, though.  My son is on the small side, but I think this potty seat will carry him through his training.  I like that it is adjustable to fit on all toilets.  We are currently using it on an elongated seat.  As we are not seriously training yet, he does not get on and off the toilet himself.  He does try to put the potty seat on the toilet himself, though.  All in all, I highly recommend this product.  It is easy to clean and sleek/contemporary looking.  A lot more expensive than the $8 potty rings, but worth it for the comfort of the kid and the fit on the toilet.  I have just ordered a second one, and will most likely be taking it on vacation with us.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"I think you have to like this toilet trainer.  It's comfortable, reliable and easy to clean.  This is a better model than many alternatives.",4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"We had 3 different potty seats, and ultimately ended up with two Baby Bjorn trainers. I wish I would've just bought these from the beginning and not wasted my money on other seats. These are extremely well-designed, easy to clean, a good sized shield for boys, and fit any toilet.(We also purchased a Sesame Street soft seat -- which was very difficult to keep clean -- and an Arm & Hammer seat which doesn't fit well on our oval toilet and has a small shield. We ultimately got rid of both and now only use the Baby Bjorn.)",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"This is all around great! I live in a doublewide, so the seats are a different shape...and this fit well!  while the potty training process has been a long one this does make the transition an easier one! I highly recommend this product..plus, you can take it anywhere!!! hahaha",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"We have two of these toilet trainers: one for upstairs and one for downstairs. Love it! Easy for my two year old boy to use, non-slip, and does not attach to the toilet, so you simply lift it off to use the regular seat. The raised part in front is great--we don't have any aiming problems with this potty:)",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,Love how well it sits on any toilet.We bring it To grandmas too and can adjust it to the toilet there as well. It sits flush to the toilet an has a splash guard. I thought my little one would want something with a character on it but It didnt matter.,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"We had a really hard time finding a seat that actually fit our son. By no means is he a large child, but apparently it is too much to ask for him to be able to use the bathroom (#1 or #2) without having to move forward or backward on the seat.Thankfully, this seat has a large enough hole that my 2 year old can comfortably sit without having to adjust.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,This seat is great.  It is adjustable to any size toilet seat.  Great quality product.  I would highly recommend it.,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,A friend of mine was having problems potty trainer her son. She couldn't understand why he was scared of using the ""grown up potty"". I remember being HORRIFIED of falling into the toilet when I was little and thought maybe he was having the same problem. I sent this to them thinking it certainly wouldn't hurt. He did a complete 180 after just trying it once! Apparently he was scared of falling in. The toilet seat gave him all the confidence that he needed! He is now a ""grown up potty"" veteran. He'll even use toilets out in public without the potty seat (something he out and out refused to do before). The only problem they are having now is trying to get him to use the toilet at home without his potty seat. Every time I talk to him on the phone he says ""Aunt Dawn! Thank you for the potty seat! I had cheese today."" or some other totally random follow up thought. I will probably forever be ""Aunt Dawn- giver of potty seats"" to him. I'm okay with that title. :),5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,And it's so easy!  It stores under the cabinet and my son pulls it out and uses the bjorn step stool to climb on the potty.  He has no problem placing this on the toilet.  It cleans super easily too.  Just wipes down.  HIGHLY recommended!,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,Early on this is probably the harder way to train (compared to a separate potty) and when little boys pee sitting down you do get a little ring of pee on the toilet seat.  However now that we are potty trained (at 2 years and 3 months) it is perfect. We don't have to teach about going on a different seat or anything. And it stays on the seat easily with little adjustment and pull right off without any trouble if someone else needs to use the potty. I will be using this for my second child as well.,4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,We just adopted 3 year old boy/girl twins and this seat is perfect for both of them. The adjustable dial makes it a tight fit on our toilet seat so the kids don't slide around. The ""bump"" in front is high enough to help everyone get seated just right and there's plastic that goes down into the toilet enough so no spraying comes out between our toilet seat and the actual toilet. We love this seat!,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"I have yet to try a Baby Bjorn product that I don't love.  They consistently produce smart products for kids that are made at top quality.  I read most of the reviews on this seat before buying it, and here are the things that stand out to me after using it for a couple of months:1.  It looks great.  The white is clean-looking and fits in in any bathroom without looking gawdy.  In addition, it's not ""dated"" with any particular character--I'll be able to use this same seat for subsequent children (boy or girl) without any problem.2.  It FITS!  Granted, I've only tried it on the toilets in my house (elongated seats), but the adjustable wheel on the back of the seat means that it will fit snugly and not slip around if a wiggly, squirmy child is on top of it.3.  It's so easy to clean.  I don't care how hard you try, or how well designed you think a potty seat is designed, it WILL get pee on it.  Fact of life.  The question is, does it wipe clean easily are you left in the bathroom scrubbing with an old toothbrush trying to get into all the cracks, nooks, and crannies?  The Baby Bjorn seat, with its simple, all-in-one design is easy to keep clean by wiping with a little toilet paper, and then disinfecting as often as you like with a disinfectant wipe.  On a side note, sometimes we wind up with pee on the regular toilet seat (from splashing underneath the Baby Bjorn seat) and sometimes we don't.  I'm not sure there's ANY potty seat out there that will guarantee you never ever have to wipe up pee.  We're talking about toddlers/preschoolers here...there will be some pee to wipe up from time to time.  Again, I don't see it as a flaw with this seat, because I've yet to find any other seat that does any better.4.  It's a great design for kids.  My son sits comfortably now, and has room to grow (we started potty training around 20 months).  No, he can't get up and down by himself, but neither would I want him to at this age.  As he gets older and better able to use the potty by himself, he'll also be getting bigger and better able to get up and down by himself.  I don't see the problem with this (even though others have complained).",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Regular training seats you place on top of an adult size toilet just were not stable enough for my son.  Add the fact that one of our toilets is oval and it was a BAD fit.  Also add that he's a very big boy and regular seats would allow him to pee right over the little pee catcher (don't know the official term ;) for that part).  He'd say, ""Mommy - I fall"" and didn't want to try.  This seat works great because you can adjust it to make it fit with more stability.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,My 3 years old son loves it.  It's comfortable and I love how you can tighten it to the toilet so it won't move.,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"We've been potty training my son for several weeks now, and he showed signs of being interested in using the big potty.  So we bought a well-rated fancy potty seat with all sorts of ""features"" that was absolutely terrible.  It was quickly returned, and replaced with this one.This seat is SO easy to use - there's a dial that's accessible from the top back to adjust its fit, and it's snug as could be.  We have one of the long oval toilet bowls, and that didn't cause any trouble with this seat.  It's secure and doesn't move around, but really easy to take off again for adults and older kids to use.  This only showed up this morning, but already my two and a half year old has nearly figured out how to get it on and off the toilet seat by himself.  It has a nice pee-guard for little boys, and sits down into the toilet a bit so the pee doesn't end up coming out between the toilet and seat.  We put a big sturdy step stool in front of the toilet, and my son is so excited now that he can get up there and down again by himself!",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"We love this potty seat! Our daughter was terrified of getting pinched with the round seats because they didn't fit on our oval toilet very well. I ordered this and she stopped being afraid of the potty! She uses it daily. It's very easy to remove if needed, and super easy to wipe clean!",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"My daughter had been using the BB Little Potty since she was 6-1/2 months old and I have moved her onto the BB Toilet Trainer at 9-1/2 months. It has a high price tag for a toilet trainer so I also looked at other less expensive ones, some at 1/3 of the cost. But after reading some reviews I decided to fork out the extra $$ because I really believe the BB brand of toilet training products are of superior quality. I'm gald I did - I really think it's worth spending the extra money.The seat itself is very light-weight, but of high quality, sturdy hard plastic. The seat opening is just the right size for a young baby. I didn't realize this until I was at a friend's house and my daughter was using her daughter's potty trainer which was of a different brand. Since my daughter is just 10 months old, her bottom is not very big and she was slipping into the opening of my friend's potty trainer!By adjusting the plastic dial you can tighten the seat securely so it doesn't slide around, even on my oval toilet seat. Until my daughter gets old enough or has a way of communicating to me that she is actually done pottying, I leave her on the toilet for a little longer after she had done some business, in case a ""second wave"" hits (and a lot of times it does). So meanwhile my daughter moves around a lot, grabbing the toilet paper roll, reaching out for the baby wipe box, reaching for the bathroom counter for toys, and sometimes twisting her body around to check out the BB teddy bear logo. It help a lot because I only have to worry about holding her steady and not having to worry about the seat which always stays put. It's also very easy to take off and put back on and very easy to clean.***** UPDATE *****My daughter is now 18 months old. I'd still stay this is one of the best $30 I've ever spent. My daughter is always on the move. When she's in a good mood sometimes she does a little bit of hopping on the toilet seat. But I have no worries because this seat holds very well and doesn't wobble at all. I do want to metion that my daughter is very slim, although I don't know if that matters much with this seat. I still highly recommend this seat.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"I'm a big fan of Baby Bjorn products and this potty seat was worth the money.  It's sleek and obviously, ergonomic for my 2 yr. old's bottom.  The only time it's ever leaked was from her error of not sitting far enough back in the seat, so that her urine sprayed between the potty seat and the toilet seat.  Otherwise, it installs so easily and remains clean so that if you need to remove it from the toilet you don't feel grossed out touching it.  I'd definitely buy another if I needed to.  We use this potty seat in combination with the Baby Bjorn step stool for the upstairs potty and the Baby Bjorn whole Potty Chair for downstairs.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,This product has been great for us. The guard is sufficient for a boy (any guard can be circumvented with enough squirming). It is simple and fits very nicely on our toilet seat.,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"We originally bought the Baby Bjorn stand alone potty chair as well as another type of potty chair for our then 2 year old daughters.  We've had a tough time potty training them (must be something with twins - mine are much more stubborn about it when they have each other as backup).  I saw all of the great reviews on this seat, but still hesitated because I was worried about spending $30 on a seat they may refuse to sit on.  We finally bought this potty seat when they no longer wanted to use their potty chairs and wanted to sit on the big potty.  Since then one of my daughters has made great strides in potty training (still have to work on the other).  Both girls know how to put the potty seat on the toilet on their own.  I think the fact that they know how to put the seat on and can climb up on their own helps them to feel more in control of using the potty.  This seat makes them feel like big girls!  Also, we bought the white seat with black trim, so it doesn't look like a complete eyesore in our bathroom.  Strongly recommend this potty seat.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Loved it, fit the oblong seat, carry it with us to daycare every morning so he's more comfortable to use the toilet there, has a great little 'bump' in the front that acts as a liquid shield, great product!",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,This potty seat (toilet trainer) works great for us. It's the only one we could find that adjusts to fit the toilet seat & stays in place. HIghly recommended!,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,It fits on the regular toilet seat just perfectly.  There is no tipping or movement.  Kids feel quite secure on this.,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Fits on larger toilet seat. I don't even need to secure it to the lid, fits perfectly without moving. Easy to clean and lightweight. Transportable if you need to take it places.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Perfect fit, easy to use, my 3 yr old can place the seat on the toilet himself and can sit on it with the help of a small step stool.  We rinse it off and hang it on the back of his bathroom doorknob.  The seat doesn't wiggle at all, which I could see being a huge issue with some of the other over the toilet seats.  Worth the extra money.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,The seat fits our two different shaped toilet seats!  my son feels very secure sitting on it and doing his business!,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"All the potty seats I looked at say they are for older children, including this one. My daughter is almost a year old. I had started, earlier this summer, putting her on the regular potty when I noticed her struggling with a #2. So rather than watching her be uncomfortable as she sat in her diaper or stood on her hands and feet in awkward positions, I decided to take her to the potty. It was tiring and uncomfortable holding her on the regular toilet seat, but using the toilet was effective at helping my daughter do the job she needed to do, plus I've saved several diapers this way.After reading many reviews, I decided to try the Babybjorn Toilet Trainer. It is perfect! My daughter seems comfortable on it, and I don't have to use as much strength to support her on the toilet since the Babybjorn seat provides a better and more stable sitting surface without me having to worry about her little bottom sinking into the toilet.I have a very small bathroom and just recently purchased a Potty Hook from Babies R Us. Now the potty seat hangs from the toilet tank and is easily accessible and neat looking.Pros:Sits securely on toilet seatEasy to cleanFlexible handle for hangingCons:Expensive (best price at my time of purchase was here at Amazon)I would recommend it, but I am wondering if the Arm and Hammer seat (which seems to be similar in shape) is comparable. It is less expensive. I would like to get another seat for Grandma and Papa's home, but am not sure if I want to spend the same amount of money I spent on the Babybjorn seat since my daughter will be at my home more than at her grandparents' home.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,I was so happy to find a toilet trainer that fit my elongated toilet seat.  My son is comfortable on it.  The open space is large enough for a male child to do number 1 and 2 simultaneously w/out having to adjust his position to ensure pee lands in toilet!,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"My husband and I bought a couple different potty seats from locals stores and we constantly had to reposition our son so that his pee was going in the toilet and not every where else! This potty seat is perfectly designed.. we set him on the potty and don't worry about a thing! Fits perfectly on the toilet, doesn't slide around and it's white so it isn't a terrible eyesore. And if the pee hits the inside of the potty seat there are no cracks or seams or anything for it to run into it just runs straight down into the toilet! Easy to clean! Seemed a little pricey for a what it is but well worth it in our opinion especially since we just threw the others away! Will be ordering another so we have one downstairs as well! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a potty seat.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"I have potty trained four kids now, and I wish this product was available earlier.  Simply the best toilet seat out there.Top Two Reasons Why This Is The Best:1) It does not slide on the toilet like many of the other seats do.  The kids don't feel like they are going to slide off the toilet.2)  The potty ""guard"" in front is very effective for the boys. Many of the other toilet seats have a removeable guard, and the kids just pull it off and drop it in the toilet.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"This was in between the bjorn potty and the real toilet and my son really didn't mind using the big toilet with this. He felt very secure. If needed, it's easy to take on a car trip for other bathrooms.",4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"This is the second one we bought for daughter. one for upstairs, one for downstairs. It's easy to use, easy to clean, does not leak, seems comfortable too.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,We have bought three of these toilet trainers (one for each bathroom).  My daughter loves them and it gives her the perfect amount of comfort and support during potty training.  Cannot recommend these enough!!!!!,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"We had a hard time finding a toilet trainer that would prevent our little boy from getting pee all over himself and our bathroom.  This seat did the trick.  It is easy to place on the toilet - our 2 1/2 year old can do it all by himself.  It also seems comfortable to sit on.  You don't have to worry about them falling off as this is a deeply seated toilet trainer.  This allowed our little boy to sit confidently on the big toilet without fear of falling off.  Overall, an excellect toilet trainer.  We bought two for our house and two additional ones for the grandparents' homes.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"[updated]This is one of two potty seats we use in the house with our HUGE 3 year old son (45 pounds, 42"" tall).The seat is well constructed, and has some nice features. In particular, it has two braces which can be moved by turning a dial accessible while the seat is on the toilet, to make the potty seat tightly held in the toilet seat, and therefore stable. That's nice.The plastic is smooth and easy to clean. And unfortunately, I spend a lot of time cleaning this potty seat and around it when my boy pees sitting down. Originally I thought this was because of the potty seat design.The front splash guard is raised to keep the child from missing the potty entirely, which is great. However, it's not aimed downward but instead is straight up and down. Unless I'm extremely careful to position him towards the very back of the potty seat (a problem if he will poo), my son winds up hitting himself, the toilet seat, and for all I know the ceiling when he pees. Worse, the pee splashes up underneath the potty seat and pools around the inside of the black rubber seal around the potty seat's edge. It's a mess, and requires cleaning the toilet seat every time I remove the potty seat from top of it.I guess I should consider this incentive to get him to learn to point down when he pees, but when you're potty training and just trying to get your kid to use the toilet at all, it's a pain.So, five star construction, comfort for sitting, and the adjustable fit. 3 stars for hygeine and spraying my son with his own pee. Average is four stars.Addendum: Since writing this review I've used a few other potty seats, which has improved my opinion of THIS one. Unfortunately unless you teach your boy to aim downwards, pee is going all kinds of places you don't want with pretty much any potty seat. This potty seat's front piece extends further down than a travel potty seat, for example, which is good. In this potty seat, there's sprayback, but in a travel potty seat, the pee can actually shoot UNDER the toilet seat and above the toilet, at the hapless parent foolish enough to stand in front of the boy. And I get some sprayback. So, given a choice between these two design options, I think the babybjorn probably makes the right choice. Bumping the star rating from 3 to 4 to reflect this. I'd still like a miracle solution, if anyone knows one!",4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Our 25 month old loves putting his potty seat on the toilet and taking it off!  As long as we leave the step stool in front of the toilet, he can use this almost completely independently.  We've got one for upstairs and one for our first floor powder room.  The adjustment dial lets it work on an elongated and a standard sized seat.  The raised guard in front ensures he doesn't completely miss the bowl, too (just remember to wipe off the inside of the guard after each use).",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,This was much better than the Munchkins brand seat I bought first.  It didn't really fit on the seat right so it didn't get used.  This fits perfectly and is easy to clean.,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,Fits snugly and easily on our toilet seat.  Looks nice.  My almost 3 year old can easily get it on and off the toilet herself.  We've had no problems with pee getting out of the toilet when she's seated.  Quality product.  Works for us much better than the build in seat on our toilet cover.,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"The Baby Bjorn potty seat is super easy to use - just stick it right on the seat and turn the dial to tighten or loosen.  It works perfectly with our elongated toilet.  Our 2-year old son uses it with ease and is perfectly content to sit there for a long time - sometimes longer than I want him to - he's happy just hanging out on there reading his books.  That said, I do notice that his bum is red when he gets off, which makes me wish the seat were cushy.  However, he does not seem uncomfortable sitting on the seat at all and will sit there for 20 minutes sometimes.  So, I guess he is comfortable and whatever is causing the redness doesn't bother him.",4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"This is a wonderful trainer. It is one-piece plastic. There's no cracks or crevices where urine collects in the other brands with the soft seat. Simple to clean, simple to use. It fits all toilets.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"I bought a Sesame Street seat at Walmart, and it was too rickety - my son wouldn't get on it, and he couldn't get on it himself. I bought this BabyBjorn seat, and it fits perfectly. It's so comfortable for him. Don't waste your money on any other adapter seat.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,very pleased with this product it is well constructed.  Haven't used it yet but it is ready for our grandsons when they come over.,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"I'm glad that I got this seat for my daughter, she is comfortable in using this and she can place and take the seat by herself from the toilet and this fits most of the toilets. It is a good quality product with great design and worth the extra money, I would highly recommend this product.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Love this seat. My daughter is almost 3 and fits perfect on it. No slipping around and fits any size toilet. I gave it 4 stars because I feel it's a lot of money for a toilet seat, but it works better then the ""fun"" cartoon kind.",4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,All the other toilet seat covers we tried didn't fit. This one fits securely and is easy to clean. Great,4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,I bought this seat based on all the great reviews and I was not disappointed. My son just turned 2 and is small for his age and he fits perfectly on this seat. What I also love about the seat is that it doesn't move once you get it on the toilet. I don't have to worry about my son slipping and sliding around as he moves on the potty. I bought 2!,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,My daughter really likes her pink potty seat. It is very comfortable for her as well as easy for her to put on the potty herself which is important to her.,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"I bought this seat for my daughter so I could save myself from cleaning out a stand alone potty.  She loves it and isn't afraid of the big toilet at all.  The seat fits any shaped toilet seat unlike some other brands that claim they fit all toilet seats.  It may cost a bit more, but you won't waste your time buying or searching for another seat.  Make sure to get a step stool that is the proper height so your little one can climb on and off the seat by themselves.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,My son first used this in Sweden and I had to purchase it since he was very comfortable using it.  Easy to use and easy to clean.,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,This was easy enough for my toddler to put on the toilet. It's simple to clean and fits well. We very much preferred this over the potty seat that doesn't sit on the toilet - my son wanted the &#34;real thing&#34;. We really love this toilet trainer.,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Great design--we haven't actually used it yet, but I like how it fits on the toilet seat.  It seems like it would fit any seat.  We were trying to introduce our baby to potties really early, but have been lazy about it.  We also have the other Bjorn toilet and she doesn't mind sitting on that one.  But we can use it on the changing table, so it's easier for us. She's 8 months.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"My son has been using a trainer potty, but if I never have to wipe one of those out again it will be too soon.  Borrowed another type of toilet-mount seat, but it slipped around and pinched his legs.  Then I came across this one, and it is THE BEST!!  I never knew I could get excited about a toilet seat, but this has really made my life easier.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"It's amazing how when you have a quality tool, it makes the job easier.  This is the case of the BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer.  It's the best fit and works great for our three year old.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"If you get only one potty seat for your home, this should be it! It's sturdy, easy to place and easy for kids to use. It's perfect!",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Unlike many seats that are made up of multiple pieces of plastic/foam that are connected, this is one single piece of plastic which means there are no cracks or nooks that pee can get trapped in (especially for boys).Also, it's easy to adjust and the handle allows you to put it on the wall if you buy an adhesive hook.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Perfect, easy to use. I like the tightening turn under so it fits any potty in the house. I've tried other seats. This one is the best for us.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Great product, I've purchased 2, one for the baby's home and one for our (grandparents) home. We recommend it highly.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"I ""splurged"" and bought this potty seat for my 4 year old son.  I love the fact that it is plastic, and easy to clean.  It adjusts well to the toilet seat, and it stays stationary. The splash guard keeps things where they need to be.  :)  The prior potty seat we had had a foam seat that eventually cracked, was difficult to clean, and it did not keep things where they need to be. I so wish I just bought this one the first time around!",4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"My granddaughter has been using this potty seat since she was almost old enough to sit up~ She's still not big enough to sit on it without the seat, but soon!. It really wears very well.....it looks brand new and cleans up in a jiffy!",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,This is amazing!! My three year old puts it on by himself and then takes care of his business! We are now working through #2 stage and then overnight... wish us luck!,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"This is simply the best slip-over potty seat out there.  The adjusting dial underneath allows it to fit snugly over oblong or round toilet seats, so there's no slipping around on the potty.  I recommend this especially for boys because it doesn't require a special flip-up piece in the front.  Also, the hole is a little bigger than the cheaper models, so I would recommend this for average-sized 3+ kids.  My son is over 5 now, and he still has to use this, so it defintely will last a long time as far as age of the child and sturdiness of the product.  It cleans up easily, too.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"This is a great potty seat.  My son always wants to do things like ""big people"" do, so he didn't want to use a little potty seat.  He wanted to use the toilet.  This seat allowed him to use the big toilet and was secure and didn't slide around like another seat that we had tried.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"My son it doing well with this seat, no little potty, staight to this seat.  The lip could be a little higher as sometimes he sprays over.  Fits on the toliet really snug",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"This made the adult toilet seat less daunting to our little girl when we started potty training. I thought the ""arms"" under the seat used to secure it to the large toilet seat were suppose to fit under the adult toilet seat, but it still fits snuggly and doesn't wobble at all. Now, with just a step stool to help her out, our little girl is using the big potty all by herself!",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Works well. My son gets on it easily by himself with a boost from a step stool. Very secure, easy to clean and comfortable. Pricey but well worth it.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Haven't had the opportunity to need this yet as we are still utilizing the baby potty seated on the floor as our guy is too little to get on the regular potty yet.  However, wanted to get everything together and ready when we will need it.  This seat is very well made and really like that it is all one piece so there is no need to worry about bacteria collecting around a ""snap on"" deflector (for boys).  Purchased 2 of these, one for myself at my home and one for my daughter and son-in-law at theirs, as they are in the process of potty training our grandson.  It was easy to adjust to fit our regular seats, and I now have it on a hook next to the regular potty when the time comes that we are ready to use it.  I also purchased the stool and potty book...and am ready whenever my kiddies are.  Highly recommend this seat as it very well made.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"My daughter started with the Baby Bjorn stand alone potty seat - which was great when she was just getting started with the idea of using a potty. She quickly became too tall to use the stand alone potty seat, so I ordered this Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer and it has been fantastic. She quickly learned how to put the seat on the toilet herself and adjust the wheel to make it snug. It was also easy for her to remove and hang on a small butterfly doorknob my husband attached to the side of the sink cabinet. The seat gave her a great sense of independence and allowed her to be comfortable and secure while learning to use the big potty.It is also great for traveling. I would put it in a zippered canvas tote and carry it with us into rest areas (it really does fit any toilet) - she could sit securely and be protected from unclean surfaces (I would carry a small container of Disinfectant wipes to clean her seat off each time we used it in a public restroom).I highly recommend this Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer!",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,We first purchased one of those potty seats that has elmo on it thinking it would help motivate my son to want to sit on it.  It didn't fit our toilet seat and moved around a lot so my son wanted nothing to do with it.  I found this Babybjorn seat and it was a life saver.  It expands to fit any size toilet and it doesn't move.  After we purchased the first one we immediately went back and bought a second one for our other bathroom.,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,This seat is very easy to install and fits securely.  My daughter was hesitant at first but there wasn't even a scare of her falling in once she sat on it!,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,I love this toilet seat! It is very easy to clean and fits really well on my oblong toilet seat. It doesn't wiggle or slip out from under my toddlers. This is the 3rd seat I have purchased and it may be the last. Thanks!,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"This is the 2nd one I have purchased so I can have a travel seat. Works good attaches well easy enough for my 3 & 1 1/2 yr olds to do it them selves. One little issue with seat if child pees too close to front side of guard sometimes little sprinkles leak trough, but nothing a piece of TP can't wipe away.",4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,A friend gave me one when my daughter was 9 months old and we've been using that since then. The curvature of the ring cover fits both the toilet and  baby's bottom really well. It does not move on the toilet as some other designs do. It's easy to clean. I also have a cover with cartoon characters on it but my daughter would keep moving off it and trying to see the characters so it's really distracting. The Bjorn one does  what it's supposed to do and does it well. Now my daughter is 2 years old and started potty training a few weeks ago. I like the Bjorn so much that i bought another one for our 2nd bathroom also.,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"I have a 3 year old little guy who is totally not into potty training. I bought a trainer at one of our local stores and it wasn't stable on the toilette and it wasn't big enough. Left ugly red marks on my little ones rear.In order to get him more interested in potty training I decided to try a new approach. We are very happy with this product. I does what it says it does, its easy to attach, easy to remove and it is stable when its on the toilette. Once more it looks like the ""big potty seat"" my little guy enjoys putting it on and taking it off himself. I hung a low hook on the wall so he can also put it away himself. This toilette trainer has made him feel like a big boy. I would recommend this item, expecially to parents of little boys who are perfectly content with diapers.",4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"We have an elongated toilet and this is our 3rd potty seat.  This has been the only one that hasn't slid around, fallen into the toilet, or made my little one scared to sit on it.  When it came I put it on and showed her that it didn't move.  She was so excited she took her diaper off and sat right on it!!Update on this great potty seat:We've had this potty seat for about a month now and my little girl is LOVING it!  We purchased the  (Kid-Friendly Stash 'n Step Stool Natural) to go along with this, which makes it possible for her to sit on the potty all by herself.  She now goes on the potty every day now!  I wish I knew about this potty seat before I purchased the other two!!  I'd recommend this to anyone and everyone!",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"We bought a cheap toilet seat that didn't quite fit our toilet, but my daughter was using just fine.  We decided to splurge for this one once she seemed ready for more serious toilet training.  She's 2 and from the first time we put her on this, she said it hurt her legs.  The splash guard is wide and digs into her legs and she absolutely refuses to sit on it.  Fits the toilet really well, but that's all I can say positive about this potty seat.  Disappointed!",1
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,I bought this product for my son.  It is a great product and my son seems to be comfortable while sitting.  I have two of them and I think their great.,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,This has made potty training for kiddos.  It's a great fit and helps significantly with training.  Need to get the step to help up and down.,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Met our expectations. Ordered for use at Grandad's, the seat was specifically requested to match the one at home.  Quality construction and easily stored when not in use.  Well designed to keep everything where it is supposed to go...",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,I was looking for something I could take with me to use in public restrooms or at other people's homes since my son is afraid of big toilets. I ended up returning this and getting the Fisher Price Travel Potty that comes with a case for around $17.00 from Wal-Mart. It works much better than this toilet trainer.,3
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"I got this as a ""hand-me-down"" that was never used and I see why. My child won't sit on it at all, she prefers a potty chair. She cries as soon as I try to put her on it, and it does NOT fit that tight on our toilet. I tried to give it away to a friend, who bought the seat and her child won't sit on it either.",2
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Easy to install, comfortable for my son to sit on and has a very useful splash guard. The seat blends in very well with the bathroom and can be easily hung when not in use. Of all the seats out there, this one seems to be one if the most well made and most functional. Would highly recommend.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,This has been a great for our son. We are looking forward to using it with our daughter.  No nasty cleanup.  We just clean it when the clear the toilt.  The only downside is that I wish that I had 2: one for down stairs and one for up stairs.,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"After looking into a number of Potty seats, I chose this one.  I am very satisfied with this product!  My son is easily able to put it on and take it off by himself.  It is snug and secure.  No complaints.  I have one for each bathroom now!",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,I've bought 2 other toilet training seats prior to this one and neither fit my elongated toilet seat (high step Kohler elongated toilet).  The BabyBjorn fits my toilet seat perfectly due to the adjusting dial you turn to &#34;lock&#34; the seat in position.  There are no holes or scary spots showing with this seat so my twin toddlers feel confident getting up on this seat.  I have boy/girl twins and this seat fits both nicely.  My boy is not as ready to potty train as my girl so I'm not 100% on how well the raised guard will work for stopping urine splashes from him.  Happy I spent the extra money to have a seat that fits and is comfortable for them both!,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,Potty training a set of twins and this is a great seat. Bought two.  Very stable and will not shift. Comfortable for the kids and nice for my boy.,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"This is the best potty seat that you can buy.  It's one piece so it easy to clean and if you have a boy it has a great splashguard.  Also, I love the handle so that you can hang it on the wall.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Our daughter loves this potty seat. She asks to sit on it every time she walks past the bathroom and will stay on it longer than she will sit still anywhere else in the house. It was so easy to adjust to securely fit our toilet, but also comes off quickly too. The hook allows us to hang it next to the toilet when she isn't using it.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"we have this and two bjorn potty chairs -- adding up to three pottys in a very tiny NYC apartment. But there must be inspiration in numbers because my very stubborn four year old is finally training!!!!The seat is comfortable for him. Catches all! and we are just thrilled.This is one bit of Gear BabyBjorn got right. Don't even hesitate, grab this, grab the step stool so your childs legs don't dangle..get a potty chair for the other rooms, and perhaps your child too will be inspired.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"I tried many different inserts before purchasing this one (munchkin, dora). This is the only one that actually fits the seat without moving back and forth. My daughter needs ZERO assistance and I am not afraid of not watching her since it's so secure!!",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,Before we bought this we have used two of the princelionheart wee pod basic which crack every single time. I decided to try this one out. It does seem a bit more pricey than other toilet seats but it is worth it. It is adjustable and allows the child to sit more naturally on the  toilet than the thick padded seats.,4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Our daughter has been getting better at warning us when she has to use the potty, thanks to the reliability of this product.  As other reviewers have noted, it does not move and is very stable.Pros:- if your child likes pink, your child will like this!- stable adjustable adapter- easy to clean: no soft cushion or other places for urine to accumulateCons:- for the price, it would be nice to include a hook designed to hold the seat, say...one that hangs over the edge of the water tank, or an adhesive mount on the side- no side grip handles",4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"We had 2 other seat covers, but they would slide on the toilet seat and the guards weren't large. This seat is like the BMW of toilet seat covers. It seems very comfortable (not that I've sat on it myself, but my son can sit for a very long time on it), it fits most toilets (has a little wheel you turn to make the inside part get larger or smaller depending on the size of your toilet, which makes it not move around much), and it has a large pee guard. We've since thrown away the other seat covers and bought a few of these for our house.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Good adjustment mechanism--has fit all of the 4 or 5 toilets we've used it on.  However, the mechanism does fall out of adjustment fairly quickly.Fit my daughter fine from the start of potty training and still now (4 yrs old).Not too many nooks and crannies to get fouled up (you do have to clean it occasionally).",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"I did lots of research before buying this seat.  At first I wondered why it was about twice the cost of the others out there.  After reading LOTS of reviews I decided to take others word for it and paid the money.  This works AWESOME, it fits on the toilet perfect with no shifting and I have never had a leak.  It comes on and off really easy, my two year old daughter can do it herself now.  We purchased the first one in white and then found it in PINK!!!  So we sent the white one to Grandma's and now my daughter feels comfortable there too, so a great thing for Grandma to have as well.  I would highly recommend this product so you don't waste money buying a cheep one then have to purchase a better one.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Not much to say beyond that - it does what its supposed to do, and its easy to clean. I started using this on my son when he was 9 months old - have nothing to complain about.",4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"They're not perfect (our 3 y.o. son is not potty trained yet), but they're the best that we could find, after getting two other types of trainers. We bought three of them. One is for our home, one is for their preschool, and the last one is for their babysitter's home. Our daughter is doing very well, so hopefully our son will follow her lead.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"I bought this seat to replace one that I already had (a cheaper, different brand).  My son likes this seat much better.  It doesn't move around like the old one did and the shape seems more comfortable for him.  Well worth the money spent!",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,I bought this for my two year old son and he loves it. It doesn't pinch him but has a nice splash guard. It is also easy enough for him to put on and take off the toilet himself.,4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"If you have a boy... this is the only one that would fit the needs.  We tried three other brands before this one and while they had their own merits, none would understand a boys needs better than this one.  Fits perfectly on the toilet and can be adjusted if needed.",4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"This potty seat fits on the toilet and does not slip around.  the child is secure and comfortable, rather than doing a balancing act.  This goes a long way for a child trying his best to learn.  Also, its easy to clean.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"after my son tumbled off the potty with the old seat we purchased this adjustable one. It's terrific, doesn't budge and has a little guard that works ok.  Perfect, highly recommend.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"We've used several different potties, but this seat for the toilet has just been great. We've used it in several public restrooms and regularly at home. Our 2-year old son is comfortable using it because it is so solid.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Best potty seat we've used! At first my daughter wanted her own potty chair, but now that she is a little older (2 and 1/2) she is willing to sit on the big potty with this seat. It makes it so much easier to just flush the toilet when finished. We put one of those command hooks on the back of the bathroom door so we can hang it there when not in use and we hung it low enough so she can get it and put it on the toilet herself. She does however need a stool to get up on it or we have to lift her.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,This potty seat fits very nicely on our elongated toilet seats. The adjustable fitting makes it nice and snug so the kids don't wiggle at all on the seat. We are just beginning to potty train so it hasn't had much actual use yet and I can't speak to how well it works otherwise.,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,Love it! the reason is that you can adjust it to any toilet. Great product.,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"We purchased this product for our 3.5 year old sone, who finally graduated from the potty to the big people toilet. I'm extremely happy that we purchased this product. This seat was our second try, the first seat we purchased had to go back to the store due to the fact that the splash guard instead of preventing the pee to go all over the place, was actually catapulting it across the room when my little boy wasn't aiming. When he was, due to the spash guard being too small and our son sitting too high on that seat, we ended up having pee running down the front of the toilet. After a week of the potty adventures while I looked at different options available on line and at the stores I gave this seat a try. I was not disappointed in the least. The splash guard works great, it's not huge and younger boys might have difficulty aiming, but I believe it's the best option available for those of us who have boys. It's extremely easy to use, we have been able to take it with us when we visit friends and family and we have not come across a toilet that this seet would not fit on. It's very easy to clean. The plastic is very smooth, so there are no issues with scratching. The only gripe I do have is that sometimes my son complains that his bum get's tired of sitting on the hard surface. But on the other hand, it'll ensure that he will not sit indefinitely on the toilet reading his books :)",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Our daughter wanted to start trying on Mommy and Daddy's potty - so we bought this.  Took 2 seconds to spin the wheel to tighten and viola done and ready to use.  She loves it and is using it, and no more cleaning up the small potty!!!  Love it!  Get a stool and viola the big potty works for little ones.  Would buy this again...",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,We have a rather elongated seat on our commode that most kids seats will not fit. This adjusted to our very well.,4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"100% happy. beautifully designed, perfect fit, easy to clean, and looking good. it can't be better. recommend to all mums.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"The seat is very comfortable and my 2-years old loves it. The only reason I give it a 3-star is because the plastic next to the handle broke after a few months of use, and I didn't even hang the seat on the wall when not in use. For the price of this product, the product should be more durable.",3
Evenflo Expansion Swing Gate,We use the gate for pet containment. It does the job great other than if our pet sitting ""customer"" is a jumper.In that case the vertical sides are not strong enough and break at the hooks. It's otherwise very good. It's actually the second time we buy this model of gate.,4
Evenflo Expansion Swing Gate,"I love these gates and when the one I had got chewed up by the dog, I was panic stricken that I wouldn't find another.  This is the only one I have found that fits in my opening between the kitchen and dining room.  I love the plastic thing on top that protects kids and pets from the tops of the gate.  I actually bought TWO so I could have a spare in case of another chewing incident!",5
Evenflo Expansion Swing Gate,Nicely made.  Very easy to install.  Impotrant - Bottom stays on the floor.  Would have been 5 Star if it had a knob/handle on the top (which I added) to make it easier to open and close.,4
Evenflo Expansion Swing Gate,"This gate served it's purpose while it lasted, so I can not bring myself to rate it a 1.  However there are a few things one should know before purchasing it.  First, it is difficult to open and close.  The latch does pinch and is often a pain to line up.  We found it much easier to just step over the thing.  Second, on the opening side there is one pinchable latch at the top and the bottom rests in a little hook of which my son was able to manipulate with little problem to push up just enough to pop the bottom out and crawl through it.  Third and most importantly, it is a nightmare for climbing toddlers.  The criss-cross design allows for easy climbing and just last week my 19 month old scaled it only to land head first on the other side.  So that is definitely something parents will want to consider before purchasing this baby gate.  For this reason alone I would dissuade parents from buying this particular design.",2
Evenflo Expansion Swing Gate,It arrived in good codition.Only problem is it is a little hard to open with the cap on top. Older ones without this safety feature were easy to open and my dogs never were injured in it.,3
Evenflo Expansion Swing Gate,"We bought this gate to keep our dogs from going downstairs to our basement where we keep the catfood and kitty boxes.  It was easy to install and works pretty well, although it's a bit flimsy and a bit taller than we expected.  Overall it works well for it's purpose and for the price.",4
Evenflo Expansion Swing Gate,We bought this to keep our puppy off of the carpet. It was easy to install and it works great!,5
Evenflo Expansion Swing Gate,"Happy with this purchase.  Good construction, easy installation and easy to use. Bought 2.",5
Evenflo Expansion Swing Gate,"I have the same type of gate, however it's not made by the same company. These kinds of gates have been mfg. since the 50's at least, if not longer.  I got one that opened across a 7 ft opening and it works perfectly.  We rescued a 2 yr old cocker spaniel and purchased this for training purposes right now.  I don't even have the other side latched, we just pull it across the opening during the day and it keeps him out.  PLEASE remember to install your gate on a stud, otherwise it will just pull out of the drywall and you'll have big holes to patch.  Love the fact that it folds up tidily to one side and is completely out of the way.Love this product!",5
Evenflo Expansion Swing Gate,We have a tri-level home with a difficult set up. This is the only gate that works since I can use it at an angle. I haven't found it to be difficult to use and it's never pinched me. It's very easy to install and I have used it for all 3 children. It's been so well loved that we need to get a new one. It's only 35 at target.com.,4
Evenflo Expansion Swing Gate,"I actually bought this to keep my dogs in our kitchen when needed and so far it's great. I have a narrow hallway and right at the entrance to the kitchen is a cabinet and the fridge, the gate opens up enough to slide between the fridge alcove and the cabinet which keeps it very secure. It's easy to slide back and forth and opens up large enough to fit just about any size doorway. It's strong enough that my dogs can't bend it out of shape, tall enough they can't jump over it (not too tall for the cats though) and the top railing keeps hands and paws from getting pinched.The only reason I couldn't give the gate 5 stars is because over the 3 years we've had this, the railing has started to crack a bit so it doesn't line up properly which is a pain since the gate sticks and sometimes comes off the track competely which is hard to realign (though not impossible). This however is just my experience with it since our gate is battered by our Husky (she bangs against it to get our attention) and the way it is positioned between the fridge and the cabinet it's slightly bent so I knew it wouldn't last forever.I would recommend this gate to anyone without small children if you don't afix it to the wall. It colapses like an accordian and little fingers could easily get badly hurt (possibly broken) if the child figures the gate out. We had puppies who liked to stick their heads through the openings when the gate was fully extended, it nearly killed one of them when they couldn't get their head out and went into full fledged panic mode. While I wouldn't say ""STAY AWAY if you have kids of puppies"", just be cautious they don't stick extremities through the diamond openings.I will be purchasing another of this gate, it does what I want it to and for the money, replacing it every few years isn't unreasonable to me.",4
Evenflo Expansion Swing Gate,"I bought this to replace a North States Super Gate.  Finding  a wide width gate  that works is not so  easy. This Evenflo gate works great. We use it to keep our dogs  in the kitchen . The North Gates was a real pain in the *** it would often stick when trying to open it, instead of gliding freely . By the time you got it open and were trying to pull it closed the dogs had escaped!!  They learned when it was just the right time to  make a break for it!!The Evenflo is just plain simple and functional! Since we do not have any small children in our house I used a tie wrap to  keep the lever open  so we did not have to  work the latch when opening/closing. The Evenflo is also less expensive and in my estimation made better.Installation requires some measuring and  screwing it to the  surface. I used an electric drill to make piolt holes, installation took me about 20 minutes. You will need a drill, screw driver and a pencil to mark where to drill the pilot holes.I do not know how well it works with children but I would be willing to bet it does a great job.Well worth the monry.",5
Evenflo Expansion Swing Gate,It's a wonderful gate. Very easy to install; very effective; very tall; and it opens and swings both ways. Great product for the price.,5
Natural Comfort Double Electric or Battery Breast Pump,"I'd give it 0 stars if that was an option!  This pump is VERY painful (damaging in fact), has inconsistent suction, does not promote &quot;let down&quot;, and is noisy.  I would NEVER recommend this product to anyone!  I purchased this pump before returning to work after the birth of my child.  If this was the only product available to me, I would have stopped pumping after a week.  I would recommend this product be permanently removed from store shelves!Consider purchasing a Medela Pump In Style instead.  The Medela pump is well worth the investment.",1
Natural Comfort Double Electric or Battery Breast Pump,"my grandmother bought this pump for me and not wanting to hurt her feeling i made up different reasons not to use it. its very loud, it pulls too much on the nipple, and u cant get the suction right, either its too much suction or not enuff. also i never could get the dual part goin on. the bottles moved around too much i could only get one seal at a time...it usually took about 1 hr to get 6 oz.now i'm about to spend tha money on a pump in style because it is 1 of 2 pumps rated for full time pumping. ...",1
Natural Comfort Double Electric or Battery Breast Pump,"I purchased the Dual Breast Pump Kit by The First Years when I first had my baby. I didn't use it often & it worked ok cause I had the time. When I went back to work I took me over 30 minutes to pump 6 oz. and the motor started rattling louder. I got it out quicker by hand! With the design it sucks milk into the motor & causes it to go bad. My employeer was upset with the time I took & I was afraid I would be forced to supplement. Then I decided to go for a better product. I got the Pump-N-Style by Medela & LOVE IT! It gets 8 oz. in 10 minutes! I wrote First Years and told them how their product was faulty & they returned my money. I will by First Years again, just not their pumps. In the long run, [price] for a pump is not that bad to get a good one unless you have a lot of time on your hands.",1
Natural Comfort Double Electric or Battery Breast Pump,"I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PUMP TO ANYONE! I'VE TRIED 3 DIFFERENT PUMPS, THE SAME EXACT ONE. THEY WERE ALL FAULTY. PUMP #1, IT WAS GREAT IN THE BEGINNING FOR ABOUT A WEEK THEN THE SUCTION GOT WEAK, AND THEN IT STOPPED ALL TOGETHER. I TOOK IT BACK TO THE STORE FOR ANOTHER ON OF THE SAME KIND BECAUSE I THOUGHT WELL MAYBE THIS ONE IS JUST A FAULTY. PUMP #2, WORKED FOR MAYBE A COUPLE DAYS AND THEN AGAIN NO SUCTION. I TOOK THIS ON BACK TO THE STORE GIVING THE PUMP THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND AGAIN EXCHANGED IT FOR ANOTHER ONE OF THE SAME KIND. PUMP #3, FROM THE FIRST USE...ABSOLUTELY NO SUCTION. I WAS TOTALLY DISGUSTED....I WORK FULL-TIME AND IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING GOING TO THE STORE EVERY OTHER DAY BECAUSE A BREAST PUMP WHICH SEEMS TO BE REWARDING TURNS OUT TO BE A FLUKE!! I'M TOTALLY OUTRAGED....I WOUND UP MANUALLY EXPRESSING MY MILK ALL THREE TIMES BECAUSE ALL I COULD GET WAS ABOUT 3 OUNCES FOR BOTH BREASTS IN 15 MINUTES.....MY HANDS HURT LIKE CRAZY FROM ALL THE SQUEEZING, PLEASE SPEND A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY ON A GOOD PUMP. THIS ONE GETS AN F- IT NEED TO BE BANNED FROM SHELVES.",1
Natural Comfort Double Electric or Battery Breast Pump,"I bought this pump thinking that an electric one would be better than a hand pump and that a double one would also be faster to use. I was wrong. When I purchased this as a first time mother, I really did not know what to expect...I found it uncomfortable and after two weeks - one side broke. I received another one and in a month the same thing happened to the second pump...one side broke as well. I gave up on this pump and bought the hand held Advent Isis. I am so thrilled with the Advent hand pump - it is unexpectedly easy and comfortable to use. A good breastpump makes breastfeeding easier - get a hand pump.",1
Natural Comfort Double Electric or Battery Breast Pump,"I've been using this pump for 6 weeks now and pretty much since day one, I've not been able to utilize the dual pump feature.  If you have large breasts, it's VERY awkward regardless of the fact that it can move in many directions.  The suction power was very good (at first) but I've noticed that it is losing that gradually!  Not only is it losing the suction, one side has worse suction than the other.  I'm still able to get milk out but I do wonder for how much longer.  I really recommend going with a single pump if your breasts are cup D or larger. To be all fair, the bottles are great, the bag is somewhat cheesy, it does come with two different nipple adapters, and one cold pack.",2
Natural Comfort Double Electric or Battery Breast Pump,"I purchased this pump when my son was 5 days old.  I didn't return to work until he was over three months old.  As a result, I was beyond the company's return-by date.  I used the product for approximatly one month before the suction on both sides went out.  I did some research and decided to go with the more expensive Pump in Style, which, I might add, I have been extremely pleased with.  After contacting the company, they advised me that I would not be able to get my money back, and would only be able to get a replacement pump instead.  I was highly disappointed with the performance of this product, and will be staying away from this company's products in the future.",1
Leachco Crib Spacer - Crib Divider - White,"this product us a good divider, my babies are very small so don't really aknow about it",4
Toy Wiggles (Styles May Vary),This worm wiggles and jiggles when you pull it.  It's really cute.  I had it in my son's crib from birth through present.  He is now 1 and still plays with it.,5
Toy Wiggles (Styles May Vary),This toy was a gift to my 6 month old daughter and she absolutelyloves it. She is teething and loves to chew on it. It keeps her entertained for long periods of time. It is great.,5
Evenflo Locking Clip,One can't imagine how such a small item is exremely important. Thank you for offering it. I managed not to lose this one.,5
Evenflo Locking Clip,"it was perfect, saved me alot of problems with installing the carseatit was shipped quickly and arrived in good timethanks",5
Evenflo Locking Clip,2 for a cheap price and it does the job good. 5 stars for this product. will recommend for another to buy.,5
Prince Lionheart Stroller Connectors,"We bought these to use at Disney world and initially they worked great. We even had two different kinds of strollers linked together although it would work better with same kind of strollers. However on our fourth day there, one of the links broke. We tried with two but it just didn't work.  I was really disappointed.",2
Prince Lionheart Stroller Connectors,"I bought these and am returning them.  I'm sure that they would be fine if you had 2 of the same strollers and didn't have to separate them once set up.  One of my strollers has oval tubing bars and the other one has round, and I couldn't get the connectors to close.  As well, they are a little tricky to separate (I tried doing this before trying to attach to the stroller) - I wouldn't want to be somewhere needing to separate them quickly, especially with 2 kids to watch!I also bought the Munchkin Stroller links which seem to work great (attaches 2 different strollers) and much easier to un-attach!  I will review this one after our trip.",2
Prince Lionheart Stroller Connectors,"Connects umbrella strollers easily, and the two strollers combine are easy to maneuver, however CANNOT FIT THROUGH DOORWAYS. Don't recommend this product, unless you are willing to disconnect strollers every time you go through a standard door.",3
Prince Lionheart Stroller Connectors,"We have a double stroller at home, but when we travel by air, we use our First Years Ignite umbrella strollers.  After reading the reviews, we decided to give these stroller connectors a try.  We have just come back from a trip using these connectors.  It is very easy to put them on and take them off.  Before checking in, I could push two strollers at once and my husband could take care of the luggages.  After checking in, we removed the connectors to go through security.  It is true that sometimes the stroller wheels got stuck, but until there is a better invention, I think this is good enough solution for now.  One thing to be careful is that the rubber grip pads fall off easily.  We have lost one grip pads already after one trip.  Other than that, it really helps out a lot at the airport!",4
Prince Lionheart Stroller Connectors,When we received these we followed the easy directions .... unfortunately the strollers slid all over the place. We have the first years Jet stroller and the front wheels do not lock so they were always getting tangle up. It may work with strollers that have wheels that lock!,1
Prince Lionheart Stroller Connectors,"I have been looking for a double stroller for my baby and toddler.  Bought 2 off of craigslist and hated them.  Found these and figured I would give them a try.  I LOVE them.  They make connecting my 2 umbrella strollers into 1 stroller so easy.  I have been asked so many times how I converted the umbrella strollers, everyone is always impressed.Great product",5
Prince Lionheart Stroller Connectors,"It was great item to use for D.C. in the Mall area. My 4 year old and 1 year old were happy to both be side by side during our visit to the museum and train ride. I saved plenty of money not purchasing a double stroller. The strollers are small and fit in any car trunk without taking much of any space. Anyhow, back to the adaptors they work and I didn't have an issue with turning with Cosco strollers using these adaptors. Hope this helps.",5
Prince Lionheart Stroller Connectors,"We purchased two umbrella strollers for our twins as ""emergency stroller"", and we got those connectors as well, of course.I can only say that it has saved our lives many times. One time (3 years ago), our main stroller was broken, and we had to wait for the replacement. Since we did not want to spend a lot of money, this was the option we chose.The connectors are cheap, and still extremely good. We have used them for over 3 years now, and even when they fell apart once, they still got back together with no effort and it still works all in all. The middle wheels of the strollers get stuck sometime, since they are apparently too close together. But, I figured my way out and I am very happy with this.We traveled overseas with the twins when they were 3 1/2 years of age. I was so uncertain whether to take a stroller or not, that still fits into the car after arrival at the new place. I thought ""alright, let's take the buggies. if something breaks or falls apart, it won't hurt."" It turned out all well and fine, and the stroller extremely necessary for the unexpected things happening at airports. We had to walk long ways, incl move of Gate at the last minute to the other side of the airport.Although I write a lot not too important for the connectors, I still hope to give some advice, especially twin parents. Even if not used as emergency stroller, this option can be used on a daily basis for shorter slow strolls.Super invention, and I am glad that there is something out there that allows low-income families to ""survive"". Great invention of our times!",5
Prince Lionheart Stroller Connectors,"I actually saw this product at Babies R' Us and purchased it for $10.  I figured I have nothing to loose by spending $10 for the convenience and option of creating a double stroller if needed since I'm expecting baby #2 in the fall.  I own 2 Maclaren umbrella strollers (the Quest and Volo). This product fit well on both the strollers.  HOWEVER, when the strollers are connected they are VERY wide and would not fit through my apartment door.  I checked out a few double strollers and they tend to be both heavy and bulky.  And if you're like me and own a small sedan then fitting in 2 small umbrella strollers in the trunk is a lot less stressful and cheaper.  I think it's great for running errands in large stores or malls with wide entrances and using it locally.  But if someone plans to do a lot of walking as exercise in the park or just walking around on a daily basis then I'd probably say go with the double stroller.",3
Prince Lionheart Stroller Connectors,I don't love them I don't hate them.  I don't use them as much as I thought I would just because it takes a minute to attach everything and usually it's just easier to have one of my other kids push the other stroller.,3
Prince Lionheart Stroller Connectors,do not waste your moneyi got it and i tried with  2 strollers the same exact one but it would not work goodyou can not  move that much and its hard to make a turn......,1
Prince Lionheart Stroller Connectors,"I have a double jogging stroller, but wanted these for two unbrella strollers incase we went on a road trip bc double strollers are large and take up our whole trunk. My family and I went to a very large mall and I went to put these on two umbrella strollers, did not work, wobbly, one would go forward, then the other, it was just awful.. Great idea, BUT it would work much better if it would cross all four bars under the handles. Now, I have absolutely no use for them..",1
Prince Lionheart Stroller Connectors,"I do not need the Stroller Connectors for connecting Strollers, but to connect my Rollator (Walker) and Shopping/Utility Cart.The bars on the Shopping Cart are kind of oblong/oval & my Rollator has round bars.Attached them together no problem & is very easy to use while hooked together. Easy to connect them & are easy to take them off.I am very happy - now when I have to go to the store or laundromat, I can still take my rollator & not just the cart.",5
Graco Two Piece Harness Tie in Grey,We bought this clip as read somewhere it oferred extra restraint protection.  We have  a 3 year old mid-functioning autistic.  Our little Houdinni debunked the clip in seconds and went free-ranging about our van.  Wouldn't recommend unless you need a replacement clip for your existing seat and couldn't get one from it's original manufacturer.,1
Graco Two Piece Harness Tie in Grey,This was exactly what I was looking for! Fit perfectly on my newborn's hand me down carseat! Thanks so much!,5
Graco Two Piece Harness Tie in Grey,"this is made of a harder kind of plastic than the one my seat came with, but it still works just the same.  i put this on my Radian since that chest clip is SO HARD to maneuver.  love this, well priced and Prime shipping :)",5
Graco Two Piece Harness Tie in Grey,Bought this as a replacement for a different brand of car seat.  It looked well made and high quality.  Unfortunately it was not compatible for this other brand of car seat and we had to purchase a whole new seat rather than just the buckle.  Graco is highly rated brand and if you have a graco seat I'd recommend this.  Just check that your brand is compatible before buying.,4
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"Not loud enough!  Shuts off after cd is played, I wanted a repeat button.  CD skips alot, light is too dim.  The positive point is that it clips nicely to the crib.",1
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"I returned this product before my baby was even born.  It would only fit on the back of our convertable crib which made it hard to use.  In also, it broke in two places while I was trying to put the batteries in and learn how to use it.  Finally, the music quility  was not good.  It's a great idea but I'm holding out for a better product.",2
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"I can't believe they charge so much money for something of such poor quality . .  first years is ripping you off!  its super junky quality plastic , seems to be really easy to break, really loud CD opening compartment, everything about it plus what everyone else said. .  this should only sell for about 20.00 and i've seen the MSRP all the way up to 60.00!!!!!  this is in no way worth that much money by any stretch of the imagination .  Of course you gotta check to see if it will even fit on your crib depending on the type of side rails you have.  just save your time and buy a regular cd player that has better durability and higher quality, it'll last longer anyway. this is junk.",1
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"I bought this item only to return it less than a week later.  This is one of the most poorly thought out and designed items that I have ever bought.Hope you don't have an active baby - the CD skips at the slightest motion.Hope you like to buy lots of batteries - I have NEVER had an item go through batteries as quickly as this did!Hope your child doesn't wake easily - the poor design of the tiny function buttons makes usage awkward and cumbersome.Hope your child has super hearing - it is impossible to hear the music (which is actually a blessing, because the music sounds like it is being played in a tin can).Buy a regular CD player and put it in your child's room.",1
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"I wanted it because it is so convenient looking for travel and saves space hanging on the crib.  It is cheaply made, the plastic and the buttons feel as if they will fall apart.The picture on the box showed a repeat button.  The CD player in the box does not have a repeat button so you cannot run the CD player continuously.I don't know why people are complaining about the batteries, every parent with young children and all those gadgets they have should have a supply of rechargeable batteries!",1
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"This products EATS batteries &amp; does skip sometimes, BUT it is very convenient &amp; is helpful at naptime!",3
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"We love this product.  Being able to change the music our son listens to every nite is such a nice option - and we don't have to listen to the same lullaby's all the time (if at all).The light is dim, but as a few others noted, who wants a bright light?  The baby is trying to sleep!It's enough light to see him if I peek in and it's still on.I feel the volume is plenty loud enough.  It is a crib cd player, not a house cd player.  It's plenty loud enough for his tiny nursery, and i've never turned it all the way up.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for the battery issue - it eats batteries worse than any other toy he has - including the swing which we use much more often.I thought that was strange, and if it does take that much power, it should come with rechargable batteries.Maybe the next model :)overall we're very pleased though.",4
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"I received this as a gift when my first child was born, and it was the best thing ever.  We only used the cd function not the light function.  It's great because it shuts off by itself, plays at a low volume (to lull the baby to sleep), attaches to the edge of the crib, and it's small and very portable.  We travelled a lot with our first child, and he hated the pack and play, so we bought him a sleeping bag and let him sleep on the floor....weird....but he loves it!  We rolled the cd player up inside the sleeping bag and took it with us wherever we went.  It helped us keep his bedtime routine in tact even though we weren't in our house/his room.  We're about to have child number 2 and I'm going to buy another one b/c the first one just died (dad dropped it on the driveway one too many times).  Wouldn't trade it for the world!",5
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"I've enjoyed this product because it is small and takes up little space in the nursery, unlike a larger cd player would with a dangling cord. However, I replace my batteries what seems like every 10 c.d.s at most. It's annoying when you are having play time with your child and the music stops again because the batteries are dead. My other complaint would be the lack of ease of pulling the cover off. It is a struggle. It is only worth the [money] spent if the batteries would last longer.",3
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"I was so surprised to see all the bad reviews for this product.I purchased this item to play music for my daughter who was premature. She was in the NICU for over 7 weeks. 3 weeks in an enclosed isolet and the rest of the time in an open one. I wanted her to hear something more soothing than the constant sound of her heart monitor alarming and the round the clock activity that goes on in such an environment. Both of the hospitals she was in allowed these. As a matter of fact, two other moms whose babies were in the room with my daughter purchased them as well.I had no problem with skipping discs or anything else. As a matter of fact, the only problem we had was one of the nurses didn't know how to open it and broke one of the pieces. We continued to used this item at home and feel it is a great product.",5
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"Another great product by 'the first years' !!This handly little CD player is great ! If you use the timer which plays for 15 minutes, you don't waste your batteries at all, I've had mine last 3 months, using it atleast once if not twice a day, before having to change the batteries, even when the battery indicator flashes, you can get another week or two out of it.  The volume goes quite loud on mine, I keep it quite low infact. It plays Enya quite beautifully,  the sound quality is quite good considering it's such a small piece of equipment.A very good investment ! I certianly wasn't disappointed, nor was my daughter :)",5
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"We are nicely satisfied with this CD player.  I think it's priced a little high, but the quality certainly meets our needs.  We play lullabye CDs on this CD player, so our needs and expectations are minimal.  One would surely get better sound quality from a $50 CD player, but this one is so handy for using on the crib.  It's certainly an *extra*--not a required item but a nice luxury.  If you like the concept but don't want to drop $50 on this, you might go with a CD player alarm clock instead, but that obviously wouldn't attach to the crib like this handy little thing.",4
The First Years - Crib CD Player,I agree with the maority of reviews.  This CD player didnt work longer than a week and skipped constantly.  The volume was so low you could hardly hear the music.I wouldnt suggest purchasing this CD player.  We ended up buying one at Target for $240 that we could set on the nightstand and actually worked.,1
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"I love this product I use it for my 9 month old, I also used it for my 5 year old when she was a baby.  I put different cd's in and it attaches right to the crib and it's perfect to get the little one to sleep.  It also has a night light attached which is a great addition.  I would definitely recommend this product.",5
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"My husband and I wanted to buy this for our kids to play the lullabye CDs people had given as baby gifts, but we couldn't justify paying $50. I happened to find a used one at a rummage sale for a dollar! Much more reasonable.PROS: plays any CD; good volume control for a crib (a baby doesn't need surround sound to fall asleep); battery compartment is secured well; ""C"" batteries are best as rechargeables for something like this, since it's used every day; optional timer and programming buttons are good to customize baby's routine; dim nightlight is just enough for you see where the pacifier fell while you reset the music in the middle of the night without waking babyCONS: PRICE; CD door takes two hands to open and is noisy; I kind of wish it had a optional wall-mount or desk base for post-crib use",4
The First Years - Crib CD Player,I have bought this for several baby showers and it always seems to be a big hit.,5
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"I really like that I can have a cd player right in the crib and it's easily accessible.  I don't have to worry about having another big cd player in my daughter's room taking up space, this fits just perfectly.  I highly recommend this product if you have a grumpy sleeper who needs soothing with music.",5
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"We registered for this CD player and received it. It didn't fit on the siderails of our crib, which in reading about the choking incident, I am thankful for. We put it on the dresser instead and used it several times a week for the first two months. Then all of a sudden it started making this very loud static sound intermittently. It was so loud it would startle my son. Not good when I was trying to sooth him with calming music. I put in fresh batteries and tried several new CD's and it kept doing the same thing. I finally took it back to Babies R Us. I was told that they no longer carry this item so they refunded the money and gave me store credit. For $40 this was cheaply made - the CD cover was nearly impossible to open as was the battery compartment. I was willing to deal with those issues, but not the sound issues. It's a good concept, but poorly designed and made. I recommend purchasing a better CD player that will last longer. I've looked online and many larger stores (like Target) have CD players for the same price or even less.",2
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"What a great idea - play CDs for your baby instead of the grating MIDI noise from kid toys. Unfortunately this product is a disaster. First - the company put in the cheapest possible speaker. I am not kidding. My laptop has better speakers. You can barely make out the music. Second, there is no skip protection (which EVERY portable CD player has, these days), so the slightest jostle skips the CD. Third, it EATS batteries and there is no AC Adapter option. Seriously, save your money and get a boom box or traditional portable CD player with external speakers. You will be sorry if you buy this.",1
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"I bought this because I thought it would be great to save on space, but it didn't fit on my Babi Italia crib - seems to only fit on cribs with the thin railings.  It was also very difficult to open - I couldn't get the cover to open and it was even hard for my husband.  For $50 we can get a much better sounding CD player.",1
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"Unfortunately I have to agree with most of the other reviewers...I had received this as a gift (having had no idea there was such a product) and was very excited to use it.  However, the sound quality is terrible and the comment below about getting more bang for your buck with a cheap boombox is absolutely correct.  I paid $20 for a small radio/CD player at Walmart with much better quality.I could live with the sound quality (I've gotten used to it), however, the batteries do not last for more than a few playings.  Its difficult to change the batteries when you do have to do it.  Also, there is something wrong with our volume knob, it gets ""static""(similar to the sound when you adjust a radio station) when we adjust the volume controls.  Sometimes there's no sound at all unless we press the volume knob down while it plays - but obviously I can't stand by the crib all day so that's a problem.They should come out with a model that has better sound quality and can be plugged in for power. While this player is better than nothing, it really should be a better product.",2
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"The truth be told, yes the volume is low.  It is not supposed to be a stereo system.  This is a perfect thing to have for a childs crib.  It shows them that music doesn't have to be blareing to be enjoyable and also this product isnt supposed to be used for loud music anyway.  That is why it is made for a crib!! To be soft and soothing, to lull your baby to sleep.  So for those who want a stereo type system to play music in the room i would suggest that you buy just that.  My baby goes to sleep more easily with the soft classical music playing. Oh! and another beautiful option.......you can change the cd's to whatever you want.  Unlike mobiles that only play selected songs over and over and over again.  As far as the batteries i have had this for 3 months and only had to change them one time and that was recent.  So inconclusion i would recommend this product.",5
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"I MUST SAY I WAS PRETTY EXCITED WHEN I SAW THIS AND I WANTED IT FOR MY  NEW BABY.  WHEN I WAS SETTING UP HIS NURSERY I PUT IT UP AND THRU THE BOX AWAY  (BIG MISTAKE) AND AFTER HE WAS BORN WE PLAYED AROUND WITH IT A BIT.  IT USES BATTERIES UP SO QUICKLY, THE LIGHT IS REALLY NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE, THE CD SKIPS ALL THE TIME, THE PLASTIC COVER THAT GOES OVER THE CONTROLS DOES NOT MOVE SMOOTHLY.  YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF BUYING A CUTE LITTLE BOOMBOX AT THE STORE ...I HAVE HAD BETTER PRODUCTS FOR 5 DOLLARS AT BIG LOTS.  REALLY!!  SO TAKE MY ADVICE... BUY A LITTLE RADIO FOR YOUR CHILDS ROOM THAT HAS A CD AND TAPE PLAYER.  THEN YOU WILL STILL HAVE MONEY LEFT OVER FOR DIAPERS.....  I AM GLAD THIS WAS A GIFT AND I DIDNT SPEND MONEY LIKE THAT!...",2
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"I saw all the bad reviews, but since there were also some good ones, I registered for this anyway.  I should have trusted my previous experience that the customer ratings on amazon are accurate when there are over 50 responses.  First, if you have anything other than a plain crib, this won't fit on the side rail.  Not a big deal, I have a newborn so she's in a bassinet right now anyway.  I didn't have any problem with the sound level as others have written, but I had many problems with the unit itself.  It is very difficult to open, you need two hands, and it makes a very loud noise when it opens and closes (not good for a sleeping baby).  The batteries are not easy to change.  The biggest problem I found was that the unit would often give me an error message when I pressed play.  This happened about half the time for no apparent reason and no matter which CD I had in it.  For $49.99, I expect a much better quality product and could easily get regular CD player that can be plugged in or use batteries, so I'm taking this back to the store.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"Mine doesn't skip. It does go through batteries fairly quickly, but I use the timer for only 15 minutes of play, so the batteries last longer. That's all my baby needs to go to sleep. The volume is low, even at max, so I can't really use it for him to listen to if he's in his room playing. I use it only for going to sleep. Baby knows when music and nightlight come on, it's time to lay down and go to sleep. Overall, I'm happy w/my purchase.",3
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"Boy, what a great product this would be if it didn't go through batteries like I go through the crab legs at the Panda Buffet!  The darn thing doesn't have a shut off button either.  So, when you press play you better be there at 4am to shut her off when the CD stops or there goes that set of ten dollar batteries. The Cd player also has a problem with skipping so don't touch or hit it, just let it do it's thing.",1
The First Years - Crib CD Player,This item would have been great if it was made to adjust to all of the different styles of cribs that are out there these days. This item didn't fit on our crib.,3
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"I love my cd player. My baby uses it every time she goes to sleep...at night and for naps. I like it cause it shuts off itself. I gave it 4 stars cause I wish it would play louder,...but it truly is worth buying!",4
The First Years - Crib CD Player,This product has little knobs under the cover that can easily break off if you have a curious toddler.Do not buy this product.  A CD player on a nightstand is just as effective at soothing a baby to sleep.  There is no need to have the safety of your baby sacrificed for this ""unneccessary"" little gadget,1
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"I loved this CD player...for a while.  It played well.  The night light feature on it was just enough light in the crib. The cover over the buttons kept little fingers out.  Then I realized that I was spending lots of batteries.  Between the  2 to 3 naps a day, plus bedtime, I was going through the 2 ""C"" size batteries in about 10-14 days!  Also, the bottons really started to give out.  The ""off"" button actually broke off after about the 4th month of use.  I guess I expected it to be a little sturdier for the price that it cost.  Overall, I loved the concept of it and my daughter fell asleep so much faster with her lullaby music playing but I would think twice before recommending this product to a friend.  Or at least warn her of the problems I encountered and let her decide if it is worth her money.",3
The First Years - Crib CD Player,I was very surprised when I used this item for the first time esp. considering the cost.  The CD player volume is extremely low even on the highest setting and to make it worse the company has put the speaker exactly were the bar on the crib goes when it is attached to the crib making the music even harder to hear. I realize that a baby's music shouldn't be too loud but I like to walk around the room at night when my baby is fussy and listen to the music and it is impossible to hear. It is only good if the baby is already asleep right near the player in the crib. For th $ it is much better buying a regular CD player for the room instead and then you can use it for later uses as well.,2
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"I bought this for our son when he was born 3 years ago.  I loved it at first.  For his first 6 months of life he slept in a bassinet and this conveniently attached to it and then came the crib issues where he would stand up and try to get it off the side which inadvertently made the cd skip, fall off the track and post the ""E"" sign. When he moved to a big boy bed we placed it on the dresser.  I, unlike other users, had no trouble with the volume.  In fact, I found myself turning it down on numerous occasions as I could here it in other rooms and it seemed like it was blaring.  The cd compartment is a little hard to get into and yes it is a little noisy but who in their right mind is going to change a cd while their baby is already sleeping.  It shouldn't take longer than the 20 songs or so on a regular lullaby cd to get your baby to sleep.  Therefore I never had an issue with the noise of opening the cd compartment.  The battery compartment on the other hand is a joke.  I now have another baby and just a couple days ago was once again trying to open the battery compartment.  I had to put all my strength into it and when it finally decided to open, the whole cd player flew out of my hand, hit the wall, the front compartment broke off and well needless to say wouldn't play another cd after that.  It's ridiculous to have such an item for only 3 years and then have to garbage it because it's so poorly made.  On the other hand though, I was thankful to have it many times as it did lull my kids into dreaminess and listening to it on the baby monitor-it had the same effect on me.  So I guess it serves it's purpose just inconveniently.  I debated buying another one in hopes ""First Years"" would have fixed these issues but honestly I'd rather find another product who can make things right the first time.",3
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"I registered for this when I had my baby 2 years ago and recieved it as a gift. I'm very surprised at all the negative reviews it is getting. We have loved ours and have had no problems. I have even accidently dropped it onto the hardwood floors a few times and it didn't affect it at all. It plays well, no skipping...  The battery compartment is in a strange place but we don't put the screw back in, we leave it loose and put the back of the clip back on which completely covers it up. I loved it so much I recommended my sister get one when she was preganant and as far as I know, they love theirs too. Maybe only 1 in 20 actually work right!!!",4
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"Despite the other ratings for this product, I absolutely love mine!  The quiet lullays play that my baby loves to fall asleep to.  Perfect for in the crib.",5
The First Years - Crib CD Player,Got it as a shower gift thinking it was a great idea but it doesn't adjust enough to fit our crib railings.  I think it was made for very thin out of fashion cribs cause I don't see how this can fit any crib that I am aware of.  Our is a convertible crib.,1
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"We purchased this CD player for one of our twins who is very sick in the NICU.  He is very sensitive to noise and with all the talking and alarms, we thought music would give him a soothing distraction.  We placed this CD player right in his isolette about 4&quot; from his head with the volume all the way up and still couldn't hear it!  For that price, I returned it.  It's a shame because I really think music would be nice for him but cannot find an alternative battery operated CD player.",2
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"This cd player isn't worth a dime!  Needless to say, I didn't read the reviews before I registered for this item, but I sure wish I had!  Yes, this cd player goes through batteries, so stock up!  I have had problems with it just shutting off right in the middle of the cd and this has happened more than I can count!  Oh, and it does skip just like everyone else has said so don't bump the crib when laying your baby down!!  The light is useless too...what is it really for?  You can't use it to see the front of the cd player in the dark (it's located on the BACK of the cd player) are you really going to turn on a light that shines right into your sleeping baby's crib??  I'm tossing this hunk of junk in the trash today and buying a regular cd player for my baby.  Guess this was one item I should've listened to my husband and done without!!",1
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"I was excited to get this product. The cd player was a gift off my baby regisry and i ran out and bought c batteries only to be let down by the outcome of performance of this product.  I played a baby einstein classical music cd for 1 minute to test the product out and was unpleasantly surprised by the horrible sound quality.  All i heard was static with a bit of music in the background.  This product is going right back to the store. I recommend getting a little boombox made by sony or an electronics brand instead of this product.  It seemed like a good idea, especially since it hooks on to the crib and has a nightlight, but i bought the product mainly for the ability to play clear music.  don't waste your time or your money.",1
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"Just with anything you buy....I believe that there are pro's and con's. yes, the night light is very light but I never even need it since I have a real night light in the room. The music is just loud enough for a baby. It plays all CD's even CDRW's. We love having something so small and easy to acces in our baby's room instead of a big bulky radio. My baby is 9 weeks and we play ot everyday for him. If you are looking for a great way to keep music in your baby's life, then this CD player is the way to go!!",5
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - Ecru,this changing cover has worked well with our changing pad helded up in the wash from so many poopie diapers...which is a nice pad along with our changing pad (which we whip clean before use  and after use..over the pad its self (which sometimes my nephew sticks to without a oniez on!),5
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - Ecru,I love this product...it keeps my son nice and cuddly warm during late night diaper changes.  Would highly recommend!,5
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - Ecru,"This is a well made cover and is very soft, which is great for a newborn.  I also bought this item in sage and I am very pleased.",5
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - Ecru,"We bought this online because our local Toys ""R"" Us didn't have contoured covers in stock.  It serves its purpose, but it does squish the corners of the changing pad that we have.  Perhaps if you have a pad made by th same maufacturer, it would work better for you.",3
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - Ecru,"other than supplying warmth for your babies skin, its useless. theres nothign wrong with the cover itself, its actually a good one because it feels like a towel, problem is, (especially if you have a boy) it gets dirty before you have a chance to even really use it. without the cover, you can give your baby a sponge bath right there on the pad, and clean up any mess easy, with the cover, it just ends up in the wash every other day. like someone else mentioned though, there is no slit in the side for the straps on the new pads...",3
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - Ecru,"We purchased one of these before our baby was born along with the Simmons Changing Pad and this thing works GREAT (so does the pad)!  I am actually buying two more because my daughter likes having her diaper off a little too much and has had some accidents on the only one we have.  Soooo, Mom told me to get two more so she didn't have to wash it so much.  Not that the washing matters, this thing has held up GREAT in the wash with no problems (after at least 10 washes)!  I'm not sure what machines other peeps are using or what they are washing it with, but my wife throws it in with the towels and it comes out perfect.Now, the reason for the 5 stars... our daughter Annabelle absolutley LOVES this thing!  It must be the terry cloth feel but it's one of the few places I can place her where she is happy for minutes at a time.  After changing her and putting on her nightgown, she will lay there for sometimes 15 minutes as I talk to her and get her to smile and talk.  It's really turned into a GREAT bonding moment for Dad and daughter and I really think it's the terrycloth.  When that's not on there and we just use the vinyl pad, she's never happy, it's almost like she's missing a cuddly stuffed animal or something... all I know is that these special moments I have with my daughter have really meant alot to me and I really don't think they would have happened if it wasn't for her cover... I'm really trying to be serious here, I have no connection to this product and I rarely post my opinion, but I felt several peeps on here were WAY to harsh on this product.  As I like to say in the computer world, it must be ""user error"".Good luck and God bless!",5
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - Ecru,"I bought this changing pad cover thinking that by going by the measurements they would fit my changing pad, but NOT. It is so hard to get it to fit on the changing pad you have to really pull and stretch it out to its max to get it to fit and it barely fits. I don't recommend this item at all.",3
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - Ecru,"I have  two of these covers for my changing table. After just one washing the cover was slightly smaller, now that my son is 2 months old it has been washed numerous times and it is way too small.Little boys make messes, I can say it never stained, but now it won't fit the changing pad at all. After 2 months of use this is worthless and I am throwing them away.",1
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,Purchased this after purchasing the Babybjorn Smart Potty because the other was too high at first. This one is just ever so slightly smaller and a much better fit for either small or early trained kids.,5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"I bought this for my 4 month old -- who is now almost 11 months old -- when we began practicing Elimination Communication (early infant potty training).  The one piece design is great for easy clean-up and also to minimize the baby playing with it when it's not in use (we have a toddler seat that has several pieces and our daughter likes to take it apart more than sit on it).  It is nice and low so the baby's feet can touch the floor even when she's very small.  The inexpensive price is also great for trying it out.  The only criticism I have is that it tends to slide on a wood or tile floor, so I place it on a hand towel.  I also wish they made a clear plastic version so I could see when my baby ""goes.""",5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"I bought this toilet when my son was less than 2 when I was tired of all of the typical childrens toilets. The potty was perfect because of how portable it is, my son could have it near at all times. The biggest problem is how small the potty is, even for my son it was somewhat tiny. He outgrew it very within 6 months but I feel that for $10 it was well worth it. It served the purpose I needed for the time.",4
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"I ordered this for use while visiting my parents. It is okay for something like that, but I would not use it for much else.I have a very active 2 year old who does not always want to take time to sit on the potty. She can easily scoot accross the floor while seated on it.It might be good if you have a very early potty trainer or one on the (very) smaller side. My daughter is about 35 inches tall and her knees come to her chest while seated on this.",3
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"We've been using this thing for over a year, and I love it.  It sits low to the ground, so children of any age can use it.  Actually, when my daughter sits on it, her dress covers it up, and no one can tell that she's on the pot. Its easy to clean and easy to use.  My two and a half year old thinks its so confortable, that she would use it as a chair if I let her.The product is very tough.  We have dropped it many times, even down steps, and it hasn't cracked.The best part, for us at least, is its small size.  It fits in a small back-pack style purse, allowing me to kiss the diaper bag good-bye. Much better than the seats I see my friends using, most of which as much more expensive.  Do wish it had an anti-skid bottom though.",5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"I bought this potty after reading the reviews and trying to decide on the little or big potty.  I didn't think the small one would be a problem, since  my 18-month old son is on the small side.  However, after receiving it, I would only recommend this potty to those who are doing EC or for travel. My son seems to like it, but he looks huge on it and it will not last for long.  It also slides all over the tile floor like someone mentioned.  I really wish I would have bought the Bjorn big potty.",3
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"I have a 2 year old daughter who uses this potty chair.  We have no problems with it.  The only down side to this type of potty chair is that there is not a removable container to clean out and instead you have to clean out the entire potty chair which can be cumbersome in most sinks.  I decided to leave it in our car so if my daughter does have to use it, it will be there for us.  She hardly ever needs to go potty while we are going places so I use it as a sort of back-up just in case.  I got tired of cleaning out the whole thing all the time and purchased other potty chairs that have the removable piece.  Anyhow, it does the job and is easy for her to get on and off.",4
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,My son is little so it may not be good for larger kids starting to potty train. He's about 27 pounds age 21 months.Get some of those disinfectant wipes and clean it out each time and you're good. (Wear gloves and wash your hands after too.)Fits in a small space in my small bathroom without an issue.,4
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,I love this little potty for car trips.  My 3 year old is petrified of automatic flushing toilets so we bought this chair to use on a recent vacation.  She loves it.  It is really easy to clean.  I just keep some clorox wipes in the car with the seat.  It now lives in the back of my minivan incase of an emergency potty stop.  We are also using a second one to train our 23 month old son.  The splash guard is great and he is very comfortable on the seat.,5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"This potty is great. As the previous reviewer mentioned, it's one piece so nowhere for the pee to go except inside. I think the only fault is that it's incredibly low to the ground, so although that is great for new learners, once they master the potty training and you just need an extra around the house, it doesn't encourage them to go because it's too short. If you can spend a bit more, the newer model with the inside that comes out ($24.95) is much better in my opinion. HIgher for sure, and actually easier to dump since it has an insert. Make sure never to use bleach in these, though, I ruined the bottom of one of these by letting it sit in a 50% bleach solution, it ate away the smooth bottom.",4
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,This is a perfect potty for a small baby.My son is 6 months and it is great for him.It is easy to clean and wipe.We are very happy with it.,5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"My son is 12 months, but he is pretty small for his age.  We got this particular potty because of all of the reviews by people with young children.  It is a great size for him--He is 29 inches and 20 pounds.  We are just sitting on it several times a day to get him used to it.  He sits on it comfortable and can get on/off easily by himself.  I love that there is no bowl attached for him to take on and off.  I had read reviews about the downside being that it is easy for a child to scoot around on it.  We just got a stick-on non-skid rubber furniture pad and put on the bottom.  It works great to keep him from sliding around on it.  The price is also wonderful.  If you are looking for a simple potty to start a young child on, this is the one.",5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,We started EC when he was 4 months.  He's 6 months now and goes about once a day. This potty is great because of the height and the splash guard for boys.  The only downfall is that I would like for it to be clear to see when they are going/done.  Great product for small babies.,4
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"I recently bought this for my 9 month old son. I like this potty because of the price, it is simple, no pieces to go missing, and is a nice size. I don't agree with other writers about this only being for small petite babies.  My little guy is a good sized baby, he is fairly tall, 20 lbs. and has plenty of room to grow on this, he has around 3-4 inches of space behind him on the seat and I am confident he will be on this for a while to come.  I also feel the height of this potty is just right too. I don't feel the need for the oversized potty trainers, which is just that, oversized, on top of being expensive and more parts to clean on them.",5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"Got this potty today and I am so glad that I am finally able to throw the old one in the bin.This potty is a simple design and so easy to keep clean.My daughter is just 3 and small for her age, but she fits on it fine. She loves her new potty! She doesn't sit on it for ages, just sits down does her business and off she goes.Thank you for saving my sanity. Finally potty time clean up is simple and easy.",5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"We used this for when we were out and about.  It was much easier to tote around than our other, bigger potty seat, but our daughter liked using it just as well.  It is very small and low to the ground, so I wouldn't want to use it as our main potty chair, but for taking to a friend's house or having in the car for an emergency, it was just the thing!",5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"We started with this potty when my son was around 6 months. He's 3 now and still uses it, although he's opting for the potty seat more often. Good learning potty as it's easy to sit on quickly. No messy parts to clean. Easy to take on the go.",5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"I started potty training my daughter on this potty at about 6 months.  She really took to by 9 months -- able to crawl to it on her own -- and mastered it by 19 months.  I even used it at her bedside to night-potty-train her -- just picked her up, put her on the potty, and put her back to bed.  Easy Breezy.She's is 3 1/2 years old now and we still keep this potty in our car for road trips, in case of emergencies, or when there's not potty available at the local playground.This potty is so small, it fit perfectly under our stroller and in a little bag so we didn't need to rush around looking for a toilet when on walks -- we'd just pulled out her potty so she could go.I love it.  No nooks or crannies to clean. No need to pack and unpack it. No need for diapers to line it (but you can do that if you want to as well.)TIP - Keep a spray-bottle of vinegar handy to disinfect it on the spot. :)",5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"This potty seat is a good buy to just throw in the back of your car for travel purposes, which is what we use it for.  However, it is VERY small.  My son is 2 1/2 and is of average size (height and weight).  It's not all that easy for him to get himself on and especially OFF this potty.  Again, it's a good price for an on-the-go potty for people who travel in their cars alot & it is very easy to clean.  The splash guard also works very well for boys.  Be careful with bigger kids when they're getting up though.  Make sure you're holding the potty down with one hand.  My son has leaped up a few times with the potty still stuck to his bum, which leads to pee all over the floor!",3
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"We love it, baby loves it, washes easy, good price, free shipping when bought from Amazon! Great size for EC babies!",5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"This is a great little potty chair that I use for traveling with my little girl.  It's small so it does not take up much room in the car. But because it is small and light, you have to watch out when your little one gets up.  Make sure they are not stuck to it or you will have to clean up a big mess.  Otherwise, it is great and easy to clean.",4
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"I have a 7 month old daughter who I've been practicing EC with since she was 10wks old. Now that she's a bit older some of our other techniques like holding her over the potty or sink isn't working as well with a mobile baby. Initially, I bought the regular BB potty thinking I wanted something that she would grow into. It works but she doesn't feel so comfortable on it because of the height. It's much taller thank the Baby Bjorn Little Potty. So I bought the Little Potty and got it in the mail today! The pink is great of course! As soon as I sat her on it she went to the bathroom without even me having to cue her. With the other potty it really took transition time for her to get use to using it but with the Little Potty she feels so comfortable, her feet touch the ground, she can reach around and grab things while sitting on it independently (with mama near by of course!). I truly see why this potty is in most EC pics! It's wonderful!",5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"After struggling to be motivated to potty-train my first child, I decided to buy this little potty and keep it in the car. It was much easier than public restrooms when running errands, or going to the park.  It made a world of difference, and he was trained within a couple of weeks. We've used it for our next 2 kids, and love it for long road trips with preschoolers. You never know when you might need it. It is small and fits under the back seat of our SUV and minivan. It is made of 1 price of molded plastic, so it is easy to rinse out. After 3 years, our last one had a crack in it from being dropped, so we bought this one to replace it.",5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"This potty is the smallest one I've seen, so it's great if you are pottying a baby. My son sat on it assisted from 3 months, and unassisted from 5.5 months, by which time he could plant his feet on the floor. It has an ergonomic design, so even when he sat on it for 10 minutes for his poops, I knew he was comfortable (the Ikea ones leave a red ring around his bottom). He's 21 months now and mostly uses the bigger BB potty chair, but still uses this little one sometimes, and also uses the Ikea ones. The Ikea ones are taller, less ergonomic, but generally the same idea. The BB little potty is definitely designed for babies, and maybe short toddlers. Since it's one piece, you just rinse it out. No crevices to get yucky germs stuck in. Oh, and I like that this potty and the bigger potty chair are flat at the bottom of the bowl because the Ikea ones are round and the pee slashes out easily--not with the baby bjorn ones, though.",5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"We haven't used it yet, but I like how small it is and it seems like it'll work well.",4
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"My sons are 6.5 months old, and 2 years old. I purchased this potty when my eldest son turned 10 months old.I wasn't exactly potty training him then, just letting him get used to the apparatus. I could tell he enjoyed it though. He had it on his head, he liked to put bouncy balls in the ""pot"", and eventually (about a week later) he began to sit on it while anyone was in the bathroom.I love the design of the little potty. Both of my boys happen to be very small, my oldest is quite thin and tall, while my other son is just tiny. This potty is NOT for larger/older trainers, but it happens that my boys fit the potty just fine. The whole concept is also no where to be found other than in the Little Potty... straddling. Yes, your child ""squats"" onto the potty, and holds the little handle, a.k.a. the splash guard. The child should be comfortable, and the possition is actually very ""good"" for ""making"". There is no where for your child to lean back, but durring those longer time periods, the design of the potty makes it so that the child doesnt become too uncomfortable. I can justify to its comfort because my children like to sit on it to watch television, so it honestly cannot be too bad!The potty is also completely one piece, and I mean that's all it is. Its lightweight, and even stackable! The wide base means it wont tip over, and its also small enough to fit in anyone's bathroom. When I say small its small, about 4 inches off the ground, and about 8x9 inches! The size has also proven to be very useful while stowed away in the trunk of my Jeep Liberty, we just pull over and let him go (with a plastic bag lining the potty of course!) Along with its small size, and one-piece design, the potty is incredibly easy to clean. I can just rinse it off in the sink/tub, and wipe it off. I would also recomend spraying it with Lysol or something, atleast on occasions.The potty's also come in variety of colors including... red, ocean, white, sunflower yellow, black, and pink. We happen to own two, my eldest son has a blue one, where we just purchased a red one for my other son (who is completely clueless as of what to make of this thing!) They are also fairly cheap, at around $9 a piece, another surprise from the usually $$$ Baby Bjorn.As for performance, the Little Potty works for us. The catch pot is tiny, around the size of a large grapefruit, yet my son has never overflowed it, whether that be with urine, or feces. My son started ""training"" at around 16 months old, and can now dump the contents into the toilet as well, although there have been a few messes on occasions (due to spilling, not due to the potty's design). We also found that if you add ""grippers"" to the bottom of the potty, it works better. Before the ""grippers"" the potty could slide across the tiled floor, making a horrific screeching sound as it went... but not any more!I totally recommend trying it out in the store before your purchase. If that's not possible, have your child sit on it as soon as you get home. I say this because I am positive that there will be negative reviews because the potty is just too small, but if its too small when you purchase it, return it and try another... My friends 98th percentile 3 year old couldn't fit on this potty, and although there was disappointment, she bought him the other baby bjorn stand alone potty (with two parts) and he fits better on that one.I purchased a potty seat for the toilet, which my son is getting accustomed to now that he's older, but I certainly plan to use the Baby Bjorn Little potty for my next son, who may even become trained earlier! And they will defiantly be around for at least another 2 years, what a great potty!",5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,I got this one to carry around since we have the bigger one at  home.It is nice and fit in luggage and easy to carry around to potty traingreat buy!!!,5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"Of all the sophisticated potties out there, I prefer this one the best. It is the only ""one piece"" potty, which in my opinion is the most hygienic choice. I also love the bright colors. We have one red (at daycare) and one green.",5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,My 8 month old daughter is obviously very comfortable sitting on this potty and EC is definitely easier when using it.  The one negative thing is the color.  We have a red one and it is hard to see if she has urinated in it if I don't actually see the stream myself.  I would recommend a white one or clear one.  Overall a great product!,4
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"My daughter already has a potty at home, but we were getting a potty for her when she was at her grandma's house. We purchased this one because it was cheap & looked ok for what we wanted.When we received it, I thought it was a little on the small side...My daughter, who is 17 months, was uncomfortable on it & cried every single time she sat on it. She loves her other potty at home so I knew it was because this one was just so small.After trying & trying to get her to like it & use it, we gave up & returned it.She was taking going potty as a negative thing instead of positive.She never even went potty on it. I was disappointed.",1
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,Yes! It is very comfortable for my baby. We have been using it since he was 5 months old.It won't tip over and spill. And is very easy to wash.,5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"I love the simplicity of this little potty.  My daughter likes to sit on it and it isn't too big.  My only complaint is that it slides around on the floor when she tries to sit down, so I either have to put her on it, or put the potty on a rug.  If it just had a no stick bottom, it would be better.  Maybe that is why Bjorn came out with the potty with the feet pads, I'll bet that works a lot better.",3
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,I purchased this potty after reading Diaper Free Baby.  I use it with my 5 month old daughter.  The size works well - she is in the 50 percentile for a girl.,5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"i like that this potty is tiny.  my daughter's in the 50% for height, and 10% for weight as an 18-month old.  it fits her perfectly and will for a while to come.  she ends up in a ""squat"" position that is perfect and healthy for having bowel movements.the only thing i don't like about this potty is that it slips around like crazy on the wood floors in our bathroom, making it difficult for her to get really good at positioning herself before sitting down.  so now we always put it down on the bath mat and that fixes that problem.there is a potty sold at IKEA for like $4 and it is the same design only slightly larger and it has a no-skid bottom.  wish i had bought that one instead, except i don't like supporting IKEA.don't think this tiny potty would work for a boy--pee might splash everywhere as it is not deep.  i don't know, never tried it with a boy.",3
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"I received the BBLP 4 days ago. I purchased it for my 4 month old son. He is about 16 lbs, and fits on it just right.  I take him to his potty at regular intervals, and he already knows to use it when I sit him on it! It also makes it easy for him to sit up on it all by himself, even though he can't always sit up unsupported. My baby loves his BBLP, and so do I!The only suggestion I have is to have some sort of rubber grip on the bottom, so it doesn't slide or tip on linoleum.",5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"Its hard to see when they go, you have to be top down. At least with boys, I don't know how you would know if a girl went. We use ours with my 3 month old for elimination communication. He loves it, its his little throne. The cutout in the back lets you pick it up without spilling pee on yourself ant the splash guard keeps the boy pee at bay.Ikea sells one very similar for under $5.",3
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"My daughter started using this potty at 15 months old and it fits her perfectly! My daughter has always been a smaller child (weight around 17lbs when we started using the potty). It's nice and small and she doesn't fall into the potty like others we have tried. I even take it with us when we leave the house. I've used it in our truck, public restrooms, and the like. It works great and is easy to empty and clean. I would recommend this potty to anyone potty training especially if your child is a smaller child.",5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"We like this potty, it's compact, comfortable and easy to clean. But it's really small, so we bought the full size BabyBjorn potty and use this when we are out of the house.",4
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"Very simple, very economical and it fits small babies. We started poty traning our son at 5 months and he loves to be on the poty. The splashguard protects well. It is easy to clean - overall full satisfaction!",5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"This is so much nicer to clean than the fancy potties with all the cracks.  It's a little smaller though.  A good size for under 3 maybe, but not so good for over 3.",4
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"We have two of these potty chairs.  We keep one in the car and the other in the bathroom.  I do childcare in my home and even with young babies I can sit them on this chair at diaper change times and frequently they will go.  This helps adjust them to a potty at an early age and learn what it is for (makes potty training easier later on).  I agree that it is a little small for older children, but still fine.  My 4 year old has no hesitations using it which is really nice on long car trips when there is no potty to be found.  Having it in the car has also been a lifesaver many times around town when we can only find automatic flushing toilets which my son will not go near.",5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"This little potty is little, but it is great!  Easy to clean out, no parts to fit together etc...  We got this in the mail, took it out of the box, sat our 15 month old son on it, and there he went!  He has to sit back towards the back so that when he pees it doesn't shoot out though.  Low to the ground so it encourages a more natural (and healthy) squat position.  Green color is much nicer than it appears in the picture.",5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"This product was exactly as described.  It is perfect for the smaller or younger child.  My daughter is a rather short 15 month old & is very interested in sitting on the potty so this is just the right size for her to independently get on & off.  The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars was because it does sometimes slip on our tile floor as my daughter is trying to get on or off.  It has no bells or whistles, which is exactly what I wanted.  It was shipped promptly.",4
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"I begin by saying that I believe the construction materials of all Baby Bjorn products I've used is far above average.  With that being said the reason for 3 stars is that the size of this chair is way too small for either my newly 2 year old son or my average sized 4 year old daughter.  I bought it because of the built in deflector, but my son doesn't fit inside of it's confines.  Oh, well.",3
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,"I've used several different potty chairs, but this one is easily my favorite. It's small enough my six month old son can sit on it comfortably. And it doesn't fall apart, or tip over, like others I've tried. It has a handle cutout on the back, so it is easy to carry and empty. I wish I'd had it when I was potty training my first two.",5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,my baby niece is about 15 months (she is a bit tiny for her age though...)I read the product dimension in the description so I didn't get surprised by its size.It should be comfortable since my baby niece is willing to sit on it long enough to do her thing while playing! It's easy to clean since is all one piece. (plus it's cute and easy to store.),5
Safety 1st Table Edge Bumper - Small,"I thought this item was great!  Everyone told me to just remove my coffee table until my daughter got bigger.  I read a few of the reviews and decided to try it myself.  I ordered the small bumper which supposedly fit the dimensions of my table, but like someone else said..it stretched alot further when my little one tugged on it.  I just pulled it tight and marked it.  I then cut it and sewed it.  I had to fight to get it on the table, but it works beautifully now.  (I did break a couple needles sewing it!)I would definately recommend this to anyone, but get a smaller size than you think you need.",4
Safety 1st Table Edge Bumper - Small,"This is a great product for low coffee tables but is easily puled down once your child pulls himself up, then it serves little purpose.",3
Safety 1st Table Edge Bumper - Small,"This has been great.  My daughter is now 3 and a half and we have a 4 month old.  Even after becoming an accomplished walker, she has stumbled over our feet or the dog and serious injuries have been avoided.  I have a scar on my forehead from hitting the corner of the coffee table as a 2 year old.  This will stay on our coffee table for another 3 years.  I ended up with the smaller size even though our table was within the range of the bigger size.  The bigger wasn't snug enough.",5
Safety 1st Table Edge Bumper - Small,"We ordered the small bumper for our retangular marble top coffee table, and it fit well, but the longer sides still are not snug. Our 1 year old can easily pull the middle of the longer sides away from the table (it was the first thing she did!), so this doesn't protect her from hiting her head on the table.We tried to figure a ""fix"" for this problem, but the only solution was either to cut it & sew it shorter, or put the table in storage...we returned this item, not wanting to spend the time trying to make it fit by attempting to shorten it.I would reccommend this for round or oval tables only.",3
Safety 1st Table Edge Bumper - Small,"I bought both the small and medium size bumpers.  They are both too big, even though my tables measured towards the larger sizing. I had to put foam pieces on the corners to take up the slack.  I think an extra small size would be better for most people's end tables, since most of the reviews have the same criticism about sizing. Also, I have had them on the tables for 2 months now and they have still not straightened out. The idea is a great one, but the sizing needs to be reevaluated.",3
Safety 1st Table Edge Bumper - Small,"This thing works great, way better than corner/edge protectors.  We have a large mid century glass coffee table with sharp corners that is definitely not kid friendly.  Even without an under-edge lip on the table, the bumper still fits snugly and stays in place. Our rascal (now 13 months) has taken a few headers into the pad without so much as a peep.  Total protection.  It really works.  Well worth the $$$.",5
Safety 1st Table Edge Bumper - Small,I purchased this a few months ago and based off the other reviews I ordered the small hoping it would fit my larger coffee table...it didn't.  It did fit the smaller coffee table but now that my son has pulled himself up using this it has stretched out...A LOT.  I am now constantly pulling it back up so it covers edges of table.  I also have to watch for my son's fingers getting stuck between bumper and table.  Definitely by smaller than you think since it will stretch.  I must say that I love the fact there is no tape to ruin furniture and my son has quickly learned to pull himself up by grabbing this bumper.,4
Kid-ding Quilted Waterproof Multi-Use Pad - 27&quot; x 36&quot;,This is a lifesaver!  My son wakes up wet but the mattress pad is still dry 98% of the time.,5
Kid-ding Quilted Waterproof Multi-Use Pad - 27&quot; x 36&quot;,"These are great to put under a Pack-N-Play, or on top of a changing table. Or even to change baby on the floor, or on the go. They are soft, absorbent, and portable.",4
Kid-ding Quilted Waterproof Multi-Use Pad - 27&quot; x 36&quot;,i got these to put on my bed for my son's morning massage-cuz by now it's no secret what little boys do once those nappies come off! the first time i used it i seriously used the expression ""let's see how good these really are""...only to be terribly disappointed: upon turning him over (yes he did let out a dose)i found i had really let my child lay in a puddle!! this o so absorbent pad really did nothing but allow for a greater area of redistribution. i even ventured to put my hand into it to see how much was absorbed n literally had stuff dripping from my fingers!!this was a waste of my money. i am back to using a regular sheet folded over.,1
Kid-ding Quilted Waterproof Multi-Use Pad - 27&quot; x 36&quot;,"I have 2 packs in different sizes. On the package it's advertized as a burp cloth. I've used it over a pillow on my lap, but it's too stiff to use over your shoulder. It's good at trapping moisture and keeping the surface beneath from getting wet or damp. It stayed strong after several washes. I used to lay my daughter on it to protect her mattress or sheets, but I find that it doesn""t breathe well enough and when she had baby acne it made the break-outs much worse.",3
Kid-ding Quilted Waterproof Multi-Use Pad - 27&quot; x 36&quot;,"This pad can be used for anything! I use one under my sheets in the area my son likes to spit up on, under him during &quot;let's give that touschi some air&quot; time, and as a take along for diaper changes...no one's going to tell you but they secretly don't want you to change your baby on their bed or sofa! Go figure.Also, unlike their cousin the 'Quilted Crib Mattress Pad' it doesn't pill up enough to care.",5
Kid-ding Quilted Waterproof Multi-Use Pad - 27&quot; x 36&quot;,"We use these on the changing table, in the crib, on our bed, on the floor, in the play yard, when out and about, while traveling. We never leave the house without at least one.Luckily our little guy doesn't have too many accidents, but it is wonderful not to have to strip off the crib sheet every time his diaper leaks.They also are excellent for use away from home. He is a little too big now for the little pads that come with diaper bags (also too mobile) but these pads are big enough that they give us some flexibility. Its hard to have too many of these.",5
Kid-ding Quilted Waterproof Multi-Use Pad - 27&quot; x 36&quot;,"I used this to protect the Pack N Play and crib mattresses, which proved very effective. However, as a regular changing pad, it spends more time in the bleach bucket than in the nursery!  Regular burp cloths are softer on Baby's face and less bulky.  The only reason I can think to use the quarter sized sheets is for the annual visit with Santa.  Santa might appreciate that!",4
Kid-ding Quilted Waterproof Multi-Use Pad - 27&quot; x 36&quot;,I have several of these - one under the sheet on the crib and one under the sheet to my pack and play.  LOVE THEM!  Great item to have!,5
Kid-ding Quilted Waterproof Multi-Use Pad - 27&quot; x 36&quot;,"I use this pad on top of my son's mattress as well as the smaller sizes for his playard bassinet and the changing table. They may not be the softest on the market but they work very well. For the price, you can afford to buy several so that you don't have to do laundry as often. The only thing I didn't like about these pads is they seem to shrink a bit when put into the dryer. My advice is to line dry them to avoid this problem.",4
Kid-ding Quilted Waterproof Multi-Use Pad - 27&quot; x 36&quot;,I feel this product is o.k. but it pills after first wash and is not soft at all. It thought I could use it for ""tummy time"" but I don't feel it's soft enough for a baby's delicate facial skin to be next to. If you want to purchase this item save yourself shipping and go to Walmart to buy.,2
Kid-ding Quilted Waterproof Multi-Use Pad - 27&quot; x 36&quot;,"I use this pad for a lot of things.  When my baby was still able to use the bassinet/changing table by graco, i used it on the changing table.  when she was taking baths in the sink, i used the pad for padding to lay her down on.  it's bigger then most portable changing pads, so i use it as a changing pad now.  i love it.",5
Kid-ding Quilted Waterproof Multi-Use Pad - 27&quot; x 36&quot;,"These pads have definitely come in handy. They are super absorbent, very easy to clean and a perfect size for many different things. When my daughter first came home I used them under her, on my counter near the sink to sponge bathe her. I have one on my changing table that came with my Pack n Play. I also use on on the floor under her activity gym (Sparkling Symphony Gym)since it doesn't include a mat. I also have two at Grandma's for changing and laying on the bed. They are used frequently and really do hold up to alot of abuse. I would recommend buying a pack even if you don't think you'll need them because I guarantee they will be put to good use.",5
Kid-ding Quilted Waterproof Multi-Use Pad - 27&quot; x 36&quot;,"These pads are very absorbent and certainly serve the purpose, but they don't look very good after you wash them.  For the price I suppose you can't expect much, but the Carter's lap pads wash much better.  If you are going to get some, use them under things and buy the white ones.  The colors seem to show the pilling more.  I use them under the bassinett sheet now.  I used to use them on top of the changing pad, but my baby is only 2 months old and they already look quite old.",3
Kid-ding Quilted Waterproof Multi-Use Pad - 27&quot; x 36&quot;,"I have a 9 month old daughter and we still use these multi-use pads.  We have had to sleep on the couch a few times due to her having a bad cold and I put one of the pads on the couch under a sheet, to protect the couch from accidents in the night.  I also use one of the pads on our changing station.  Hope this helps :)",5
Kid-ding Quilted Waterproof Multi-Use Pad - 27&quot; x 36&quot;,"Been using these for six weeks. Handy and functional but the fabric pills badly after only a wash or two. They're still usable but ugly (esp. when they're on the changing table all the time.) Don't have the same complaint that others do about cleaning--I spray some Shout on the stains and wash clean--but I don't let the stains sit more than one/two days. I have another one that held up much better, unfortunately I don't see it here online.",3
Quilted Travel Changing Pad,I agree with the first reviewer. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this product.  My daughter also wets on the pad between the old diaper and the new one and so we had to purchase a solid changing pad to avoid wet spots on our bed.  The problem with the product is that it has stitching between the quilted areas and they must use a big needle because there are stitch holes that allow wetness to just leak right through.  I want my money back!!,1
Quilted Travel Changing Pad,"The portable changing pad is wonderful, I would recommend it to all my friends.  You can have it with you at all times whether your at a restaurant, movie theater or even a friends home.  It's so easy to use and store for that at home feel on the go.",4
Quilted Travel Changing Pad,"Our son is now 9 months old and we have used this changing pad since birth.  We have been happy with it.  We actually keep it tucked under the coffee table for when we change him in the living room.  We havent had any problem with it leaking through.  On those occasions when he has &quot;suprised&quot; us between diapers, the pad has wiped clean easily with a wipe.I had origionally bought it to keep in a diaper bag, but most come with their own pads anyway, so we never needed to.  I think it would be a bit large for a diaper bag.",4
New Gerber Electric Baby Bottle Warmer Complete,It heats up the bottle okay but it has been known to shock you. Doesnt have an on/off switch. The water in it turned Brown and stained my bottled. Even keeping it clean!,2
New Gerber Electric Baby Bottle Warmer Complete,"I used this warmer 4 times. Each time I got an electric shock from it. I know there has to be a safer alternative. Perhaps another brand. I started to just fill up a bowl with HOT tap water and place the bottle in it for a couple of minutes. I found that to work just as well, and was not as painful as the shocks!",2
New Gerber Electric Baby Bottle Warmer Complete,this thing is worthless!!  it takes to long in the middle of the night to measure the water and then it takes way to long.  for the milk to warm up.  and if you have long bottles then you will have two different tempatures in the bottle.  don't waste your money!!!,1
Double Headrest for Newborns &amp; Infants,"I have one of these for our 3.5 month old baby. We've been using it since the day she came home from the hospital, and have no complaints.Good Things:1) Very easy to move between car seat, stroller, swing, bike trailer - has velcro tabs that bend around the shoulder straps of whatever harness you are using.2) Machine washable and dryable. (At least, we dried it in the machine)3) Insert easy to remove when baby is big enough.4) Different colors so you can match things.6) Stays secure with velcro - doesn't slide around and baby can't play with it, try to eat it, remove it, or choke on it.7) Has a notch cut into the seat part so that the harness for whatever you are hooking it too can buckle easily without bunching up the fabric.Bad Things:Well,potentially only this one:I understand another reviewers words of caution about not using products built specifically for your car seat - but I do not think this particular one would compromise the safety of your baby - but I'm also not a car safety seat inspector.",5
Double Headrest for Newborns &amp; Infants,"If I could have used zero stars, I would have been more accurate.It's true that after market items like this HAVE NOT BEEN CRASH TESTED and are therefore NOT recommended for use with your car seat.  The alternative IS to use rolled up towels or diapers AROUND your baby's head or body.  NOT BEHIND.  The problem with these headrests is that they add material behind the heads and bodies.  This added material increases the distance your baby will travel during a crash.  This isn't good.  Your car seat wasn't tested with extra material.  That's why they aren't recommended.",1
Double Headrest for Newborns &amp; Infants,"This headrest is perfect.  Since day one my daughter has been comfy using this.  When she was teeny tiny the insert kept her head from flopping forward.  Now that she is bigger we use it without the insert and she's still happy.  At 4 months she has wonderful head control, but I wouldn't put her in her carseat without this.  I tried the head rest that came with her Graco car seat and it was terrible.  It sort of lets her head roll all over when we carry her from the house to the car.  For a small baby I wouldn't even think about using the flimsy headrest they give you with the seat.",5
Double Headrest for Newborns &amp; Infants,"I love this product.  It holds my son's head up straight and let's him sleep without his head flopping everywhere.  I have the Chambray color but it's still the same product.  I suggest having 2 on hand.  1 in the carseat and 1 in a swing or bouncer.  Also, if baby spits up on 1, then you have another to use while you are washing the first one.",5
Graco Splat Mat,"This mat was great when my baby was learning to turn over.Later it was great to keep mess where it belonged: off my floor.It's easy to clean.Little enough to store,and will still be a great use for all those little crayon errors when my child learns to color.",4
Graco Splat Mat,"I pulled this thing out of the package and just rolled my eyes- it's half a shower curtain with an ugly design on it! Save yourself the money. Go buy (as many others have suggested) a heavy duty vinyl shower curtain or tablecloth- not only will you save money, but you get to choose something other than the Miami Vice pastels!",1
Graco Splat Mat,"This has really saved our carpets and floors, but the material is somewhat thin and has a tendendcy to fold over and wrinkle up.  This can cause a few minor tripping accidents if left that way.Overall it does what is claims, but it could be a little thicker material.",4
Graco Splat Mat,"Very simply stated, this mat placed under our son's chair makes life easier.  Place it under the seat and let the food fly where it may.It does slide a bit but if placed under his seat the seat holds it in place.  Well worth the money spent to buy it.",5
Safeway Wall Mount Top Of Stairs Gate White 24.75&quot; - 43.5&quot; X 30.5&quot;,"Pros: mounts easy, works well day-to-day, small bars are strong but not obtrusive, quality built, kids can't climb up since bars are vertical.Cons: must be sure it's latched.  If you don't here the click, and/or you don't pull up every time to ensure it's latched, it could potentiall be unlatched when it looks latched.  This only happened to us once out of hundreds of openings/closings.",5
Safeway Wall Mount Top Of Stairs Gate White 24.75&quot; - 43.5&quot; X 30.5&quot;,"I have a daycare in my home and bought 2 of these gates to cover both stairways. Within 3 months, both were broken beyond repair. The metal is great, but the plastic peices that hold the metal to the wall are WEAK and broke on me TWICE! Once was when a parent pulled the gate closed- apparently too hard... the other was when my 20-month-old son tried to pull the gate open. Come on, he's a baby and exactly who these gates are designed for! He shouldn't be able to break it. Luckily he got scared and cried instead of taking a tumble down the stairs.  Don't buy this gate!",1
Safeway Wall Mount Top Of Stairs Gate White 24.75&quot; - 43.5&quot; X 30.5&quot;,Perfect! Very happy with the gate. Easy to use for my older children and helps keep my little one safe.,5
Safeway Wall Mount Top Of Stairs Gate White 24.75&quot; - 43.5&quot; X 30.5&quot;,"I purchased this gate because I needed something sturdy for the two stairwells in my home.  They weren't very easy to install.  We needed to buy longer screws and one of the holes didn't match up so we needed to drill a hole through the steel gate.  Now that they're up, I'm satisfied that I purchased a pair of VERY sturdy gates.  However, I am very DISAPPOINTED in regard to how difficult this gate is to open with one hand.  The mechanism to open the gate is somewhat difficult - especially when you're holding a 20 pound baby at the top of a stairwell!  But, since they were too tough to install in the first place, we're keeping them up and I'll just have to work on my &quot;opening technique while carrying a baby&quot;.",3
Safeway Wall Mount Top Of Stairs Gate White 24.75&quot; - 43.5&quot; X 30.5&quot;,"My 15 month old was walking around the gate with my mom to go down the stairs and the bolt part of the locking mechanism cut and bruised his forehead.  The locking mechanism consists of two bolts that screw into the top and bottom of the gate...then snap into plastic pieces(one on top and the other on bottom) that are fixed to the wall.  Shame on this company for manufacturing someting so dangerous.  I notified the company and they made me feel as if it were entirely my fault. They are going to refund my money, however, I don't want to see this happen to anyone else, especially a small child.",1
Safeway Wall Mount Top Of Stairs Gate White 24.75&quot; - 43.5&quot; X 30.5&quot;,WE NEEDED SAFETY GATES FOR OUR NEW HOME...MY WIFE PURCHASED 5 OF THESE GATES FROM BABY'S R US FOR 64.99.....CONSUMER REPORTS #1 RATED SAFETY GATE....A FEW DAYS LATER WE WENT TO IKEA AND FOUND THE SAME EXACT GATE WAS 19.99...IKEA CALLS THEM PATRULL FAST....THE SAME EXACT GATE FOR ONE THIRD THE PRICE....,2
Safeway Wall Mount Top Of Stairs Gate White 24.75&quot; - 43.5&quot; X 30.5&quot;,"I did follow the directions exactly and still needed a stiff drink and lots of spackling and paint after installing this gate!! However, once installed it works beautifully.  What I like best about the gate is that it does not have bulky plastic parts that draw attention to the gate.  It is very easy for an adult to unlatch, but a child would have difficulty figuring it out.  One thing that the directions left out, was that the two main pieces of the gate will not properly line up unless you position them so that you can see a warning label on both the top and the bottom side of the gate. I thought I had a bent piece and was ready to take the gate back, until I tried several different ways of positioning them.  The directions didn't tell which way to put them.",4
Safeway Wall Mount Top Of Stairs Gate White 24.75&quot; - 43.5&quot; X 30.5&quot;,I like that you don't have to step over anything and that it's not spring-loaded so that it can be left open.,5
Safeway Wall Mount Top Of Stairs Gate White 24.75&quot; - 43.5&quot; X 30.5&quot;,"I am very pleased with this item. It is definetely well made and sturdy. My 65 pound dog will not even try chewing it, perhaps because it can sense the material is made of is not soft wood. After you install it, it feels tight and secure. It is definetely the best I have bought. I would say that the instructions were very clear. However, I was required to go to a hardware store to get longer wood screws. This gate only includes screws for mounting directly on a hardwood surface, but if you need to reach wood behind your walls you will need other screws. A quality product like this should spend [the extra change] on longer screws and include them with the product.",4
Safeway Wall Mount Top Of Stairs Gate White 24.75&quot; - 43.5&quot; X 30.5&quot;,"I can only echo many of the things said by others here. This is an excellent gate. One comment for the woman who pops the gate off its hinges - You FORGOT to install the retaining caps at the top of the hinges! Why blame the product for your inability to follow directions? This gate locks in at all 4 corners and will withstand anything a child can dish out. It easily opens with one hand for all but the inept. The width range made it an easy fit for my extra wide staircase. It is very sturdy across all widths. I love it so much I'm keeping it for the presently non-existent grand kids. OK, I have at least 10 years to wait.",5
Safeway Wall Mount Top Of Stairs Gate White 24.75&quot; - 43.5&quot; X 30.5&quot;,"We really like this gate.  We have a very wide stair case and bought the extension to go with this gate. (make sure you get the right extension) IT IS AWESOME!  My husband is really good with projects so we kind of made it better by putting a different latch then the one that was sent.  We also put some longer screws so that it would w/o a doubt stay in the wall.  It has been able to withstand our daughter pushing on it, hitting it w/her walker, and our doberman trying to get down our stairs.  So, all in all, it is a wonderful gate for children & animals!",5
Safeway Wall Mount Top Of Stairs Gate White 24.75&quot; - 43.5&quot; X 30.5&quot;,"The gate itself was nice the hardware is a hard plastic would have like to have seen metal.  The gate ordered was white, I recd a black one",1
Safeway Wall Mount Top Of Stairs Gate White 24.75&quot; - 43.5&quot; X 30.5&quot;,"When I first unpacked this item I reviewed the instructions, as usual, to get a sense of what would be involved with the installation. The written instructions were virtually useless, however -- poorly written and not at all coordinated with the visual component of the instructions (which are placed in another section of the booklet entirely).When I began assembling the gate, the first thing that became obvious was that the two over-lapping, iron halves of the gate did not fit together. After trying to attach them in various ways using the included screws it became obvious that the holes drilled in the top of one of the halves were completely out of alignment with the holes drilled on the bottom of the piece and the holes on the other half of the gate. Thus alignment was impossible. Cheaply made and deeply flawed.Also worth noting that the additional product being sold -- the Safeway Wall Mount Top of Stairs Gate for $12,95 -- simply consists of a strip of wood and a few screws. If for some reason you don't already have equivalent stuff sitting in your toolbox you could easily buy this at any hardware store for under $5.I've emailed the seller, but since I actually bought this item in June and just got around to trying to install it this past weekend I'm not optimistic they'll be able to help. And I'm not sure I'd want this gate even if they did send me a new gate section with correctly aligned holes. Try something else!",1
Safeway Wall Mount Top Of Stairs Gate White 24.75&quot; - 43.5&quot; X 30.5&quot;,"After sifting through what seemed like thousands of reviews on various baby gates, my husband and I decided on the Safeway Gate and have been extremely happy with our purchase!This is an excellent gate for the top of a staircase.  It's kept my inquisitive 13 month old safe as well as the 25 month old and the 3 year old that I babysit.  None of the three boys have learned to open the gate yet which I find encouraging.  This gate has definitely passed the test in my book with three boys who try to hang off the top bar and shake it like crazy!I didn't find the latch to be difficult at all...of course I tend to push on the actual latch rather than the triangular button above to release the catch and open the gate.  I also like the audible ""click"" when the gate is securely shut.  Like others have mentioned, the lack of anything on the floor (bar, pad, etc.) was perfect since we do have ours installed at the top of a flight of stairs.A nice perk for small animals living with baby: We have 2-3 inch baseboards/molding at floor level so we installed the gate about two to three inches above that which gave just enough clearance for our three cats to slide underneath without letting our (then) seven month old crawl underneath.The downside is the installation process, but after reading the reviews we were prepared for that part and went to Home Depot and bought a simple $3 box of deck screws and it made installation much easier.This gate is a bit more expensive than some of the gates out there, but it's metal not plastic; secures with screws rather than pressure mounting against the wall; the rails are made vertically rather than horizontally or ""mesh-like"" holes (vertical rails help deter if not downright prevent climbing toddlers from getting over this gate) and we just decided that this gate was the best value and safest for our son (and his soon to be little brother or sister).",5
KidCo G24 White 24&quot; Safeway or Elongate Extension,"After doing tons of research to find a good gate to fit an extra large opening, we chose this one based on price and ratings.  We are very pleased with this gate.  It is plenty sturdy, even spanning a large opening, and although the instructions were rather confusing the installation really was not difficult.  I was concerned about the comments from other buyers about damaged packaging and missing pieces and I can see how that could happen as our packaging was also beat up.  The corners of the boxes had holes worn in them and there was some cosmetic damage to the gate corners but luckily none of the hardware escaped from the open corners.  Not sure why the packaging problems have not been resolved but fortunately it did not cause us any usage problems.  I would absolutely recommend this gate to others looking for an extra long gate.",5
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"I don't really know if this thing works or not because my 8 mo old refuses to have anything to do with it. Keep in mind that she puts anything & everything in her mouth, will eat any food I try to feed her & is currently teething. It seems like a great idea for that short transition period between mush & solids. This particular one appealed to me because it's not dyed & it's made in the USA. As to whether or not it works? I will never know!",1
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),Very good idea.  Wish they had them 35 years ago!  Great as a teether helper with frozen fruit inside.  Recommend.,5
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),We bought one for my 6 month old and he loves it as much as we do.  We take it when we go out to eat and it keeps him busy for ages.  We can put all kinds of foods in it and he just loves to suck  and chew on it.  It allows us to give him foods he would otherwise have to wait months to try.  Plus we do not have to worry about him choking.  Cleaning the mesh is a pain but the product is well worth the effort,5
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"OK, my son is probably like most kids, wanted to try everything we were eating.  These are great!  You can put pretty much anything in there and they can just gnaw away, it is so great for when they are teething, put frozen mango, banana, etc. inside.  And when you are first doing solids, if you don't want to buy yucky jarred food, fresh is best and way cheaper (and much better than starting with cereal).  Buy extra mesh bags, organic whole foods, and you are set.",5
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"My son seems to like this. Though if he bangs it around enough, the ring becomes slightly loose. Haven't had any problems cleaning the mesh bag.",4
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),My son is 8 months we have used this item 3 to 4 times since november. He was not really that found of it but I gave it a try since so many highly recommended it and after spending 10$ for it on amazon(shipped)Imagine my supprise when I see a piece of apple next to my kid and ask my mom how he got it out of the feeder.My mom said he was chokeing on apple and shown me the mesh ripped completly from top to bottom like you would cut it with a sharp knife. I will try to add a picture of it ripped.My feeder is ripped and my kid is alive - lucky me I dont have to gamble with my baby life again - and why? to let him suck on a fruit thru a ""sock"" that is unsafe. You want your baby to eat fruit mash it and feed him please don't experriment.Awful product I dont understand why people write such good reviewes. Just put a piece of fruit in it and try it yourself if you like it -AWFUL!,1
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"My sister-in-law bought this for me, and it was a lifesaver!  My son stayed quiet while I cooked dinner.  However, he's 10 months old, and likes to throw things on the floor.  The green top breaks very easily, and my son has just broken the third top. I can't keep buying replacements for it--it's getting too expensive.  The idea is excellent, but the product quality stinks, and I'm not buying another replacement, nor am I going to encourage any of my pregnant family or friends to buy it.",1
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"I bought this product before our daughter was born because it seemed like a good idea.  It turned out to be money very well spent.  She loves it.  I love it. I am able to feed her fresh fruit and know that she is getting good nutrition, learning new tastes, and will not choke.  I've used bananas, pears, canteloupe, watermelon, grapes, etc.  I am buying them for baby shower gifts now too.  To get it as clean as possible again, I soak it in a very dilute solution of bleach water.  It works nicely.",5
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"Well made and tight fit, safe for baby.  Should be just a touch lighter in weight, but good no matter.",5
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"This is THE BEST little baby gadget yet.  The first time I saw it I thought, ""What will they think of next..."" but now that my 2 year old and nearly 1 year old are putting everything in their mouths this is an indispensable part of our home.  It's great for teething because you can stuff it with cold fruit and your baby will love sucking away while getting all the juice out of grapes, pineapple, watermelon, even strawberries!  It's great for regular feeding too, since you can now place larger pieces of food inside to give your child a taste of such things as meat, fresh brocolli, etc.  The easy to clean mesh bag does get stained pretty quickly, I tried to boil mine clean with gentle soap and water, but after just two weeks of steady use, the carrots and bananas had stained the bag permanently.  The refill package costs nearly as much as the unit itself, but it's worth the total investment for peace of mind that your baby will NEVER choke on anything they eat through this feeder.  I suggest bringing an extra along in the diaper bag -- it's a great thing to have on trips.",5
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"I love this item and we use it almost daily. My daughter's eyes light up when I start filling it, she loves it that much! She has tried many more fresh fruits and vegetables than my other kids did at her age. I even put broccoli in it and she devours it.The only downside is that the net can be difficult to clean when very small food particles are embedded. Sometimes the dishwasher doesn't get it all, so it has to be scrubbed by hand in addition. For that reason, we bought three extra nets. If I haven't had time to clean one, we just grab an extra.Overall, I think this is one of the most useful baby items I've purchased in a while. It beats feeding her nothing but food out of jars.",5
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"A neighbor had recommended this product and it sounded great. I bought it along with extra bags and my baby loves it.  We have used it several times and have found two major problems with it. It is really a pain to clean but worse than that - my baby breaks out in a rash around his mouth after each use, despite us washing his face immediately after he is done eating.  We have determined that he is allergic to the mesh and won't be using it again.  What is it made of anyway?? I threw the packaging out and wish I had kept it.",1
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"I bought this when my daughter was 6 months old to help her learn to chew. It is very flimsy and floppy when food is in it. She just played with it (flipping it around) thinking it was a toy. She is teething also so I thought it would definitely go in her mouth often, but she enjoyed throwing it around instead.",1
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"I didn't find it too dificult to clean as others commented. It's good for babies over 6 months but one must understand that the baby might throw it away (sometimes very far away) and then all the food is gone. It's a cheap item and the baby might have fun as mine did. When they get a bit older and holding things for longer, it is very handy to leave the baby busy eating some fruit, for example.",4
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"I have been personally buying this for everybody I know that are having a baby or planning to have a baby.Love this, my son is hooked on fruits now!K",5
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"We started using this feeder when my son was just 3 months old.  He loved the flavor of melon, but we were uncomfortable with letting him bite on a piece of melon for fear he might choke.  The baby feeder was the perfect answer.You can cut up just about anything and place it in the feeder bag.  We even put lightly frozen grapes in it when my son was teething.  We used it mostly for fruit, especially melon, grapes, pears, and strawberries.  I will admit that it can be messy to use this feeder, but it was totally worth it to us to give our son a chance to learn to love fresh fruits.  Enjoy!!!!",5
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"This product is great.  My daughter loves it...espcially peaches and watermelon!  However beware of bananas....  It gets stuck in the mesh and is very, very hard to clean!  I ran it thtouhg the dishwasher twice...still stuck.  I ended up soaking it in a cup of gel bleach.  That did the trick :)",4
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),I bought this little gadget when my daughter was 5 months old.  I figured when she started to eat cookies and real fruit she'll need this.  If anything my daughter is amused by it.  She'll grab it and bang her food tray with it.  She has actually chewed food through the mesh on a few occasions.  It also helps at a restaurant when the little one wants what's on mommy or daddy's plate.  It's not a bad thing to own so I would recommend it.  I guess it just depends on how your child will receive it.,4
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"I only rate it a 3 because I haven't tried it yet myself. However, I did look up the product and found that there are Baby Safe Feeder Replacement bags. They come 4 per package, are top rack dishwasher safe (or utensil basket). They cost around 7.99This should help in alleviating the frustration some have expressed regarding the cleaning process.",3
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"although i don't have this specific feeder, i do have one by Sassy. the whole idea is great, and my 7 month old son loves it. we also looped a pacifier keeper around the handle so that when we go out to eat we don't have to worry about it falling on the floor. i got the Sassy brand one at k-mart for $4, it has a few bonus features such as the inside part of the handle (not the part you hold, but the part that is on the inside of the bag) is filled with water that keeps the food chilled if you want. Also a big bonus is that it comes with a cover so that you can cap it and put any unused portions away for later, and the mesh bag won't touch anything. it also has a safety feature, like on pill bottles--that clicks so you know it is secure, and has 2 buttons to push on while turning that releases it. it's a great invention whichever one you buy, i highly recommend the Sassy brand.",5
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"I bought this to help with teething and help my baby explore new food without choking.  Overall , it's pretty good.  I think you can buy this one and not the ""Starter Kit.""  All you really need is one set.  I have tried it with ice, which she loves, and peas and a frozen peach.  It is a huge mess, which I can deal with.  The main issue I have with it is that the mesh is pretty thick so it's hard for her to actually get any food out of it.  It is easy to clean and she likes it overall.  I wouldn't say this is one of my indispensable baby items though.",4
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"My 6 months old loves food!  I don't buy jarred food, I cook frozen or fresh foods and grind it up for her.  This item is awesome.  I don't have to grind things up.  I can just give her the safe feeder and she sucks it right down.  She loves being able to do it herself too.  Definetly worth the money 100 times over.  You'll be glad you have this!",5
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"This is one of the best products!  I cut up fresh fruit and stick a couple of pieces in and give it to my son (7 mos.) and it would keep him distracted for a while.  I would give it to him in his high chair and could get a lot done around the kitchen while he was sucking.  I was comfortable with this as I knew I could turn my back and he wouldn't choke!  Another thing we do is stick an ice cube in it and he loves it, and it isn't very messy to clean up!  I will definitely reccommend this product!!",5
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"Baby Safe FeederI very first purchased one of these for my grand-daughter 6 year ago and have purchased many more for all of the grandbabies and friends with babies! These are awesome as you don't have to worry about the babies choking on crckers, cookies fruit etc! They are wonderful!",5
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"We have enjoyed this product because we can give our son interesting, solid food from our plates without worrying about him getting too big of chunks. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was the price. I think a mesh bag does not need to cost $$$.",4
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"I have loved this product! My baby is now 6 months old and doesn't always want veggies with cereal. However, with this product, I just make a whole bunch of ice cubes with whatever pureed veggies I want, plop the cube in the feeder and she gets the vitamins and relief from teething! I plan to freeze pureed soups with meat and veggies later in this fashion. My only concern--some of the edges are a little sharp.",4
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"BUY THIS!it is great!but - i would have thrown it out the window after the first time we used it (bananas!) had i not read the customer review that instructed how to clean it. it gets really messy and hard to clean UNLESS you follow the tip and soak it in oxyclean detergent and melt away all the goop. *just don't forget to rinse rinse rinse off all the detergent residue!!!!*it is a great invention - been using it for many months with my now 11 month old son - favorites are mango, watermelon, grapes...he had some steak tips last week! it is a wonderful thing - just make sure you follow the cleaning tip and you'll love it!",5
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"The bag is a little tricky to clean (thanks for the oxyclean tip, Billy Mays RIP!)...otherwise, this thing is fantastic!  Ok, so--it makes a mess...or do I just have a messy baby???  She winds up with fruit all over her, and what did I throw in it tonight?  BLUEBERRIES, brilliant, just brilliant.  Especially since she was wearing our favorite outfit.  Maybe the Oxyclean will be doing double duty tonight?The handle is perfect for their little hands, the thing freezes to keep the fruit/veggies cold...and it's good for a ""snacker"" on the go.  When we run errands, I always have chunks of frozen fruit with us to throw in and give her when hungry.  Also, a pacifier attacher-thing also works for this, so you can ensure it isn't being thrown across the car/store/etc.I wouldn't do avocados in it though...they are too thick and won't go thru the bag.  Too bad, my little one loves avocados!",4
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"I bought 2 of these and my girls used them for quite awhile.  They can be difficult to clean, especially with bananas.  But, they are great with teething babies or with babies that want to eat big people food.  It's much safer than chunks of food!  Very worth their price!",5
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"I bought this for my son (now 2), and again for my daughter (6 months) when she was born.  I absolutely love my baby safe feeder.  We do use it for food, but more often, we fill it with ice.  Especially while out at restaurants.  The ice works great to keep baby happy, is healthy for baby, and when teething time comes, is fantastic to sooth those sore gums.I am now buying another baby safe feeder as a gift.  I love this product!  It's inredible that so few people know about it still!I have given and will continue to give this as a gift to all new (and veteran) mom's for baby-to-be!",5
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),I love this idea and  so does my son. He had his first local gorn apple at 5 months old thanks to this product. He gnawed that thing to death. We keep one at home and oone in the diaper bag for when we got out. It is easy to clean and is one less thing to worry about. Of course supervision is still required but makes you feel safer knowing the baby is eating healthy food and staying safe from choking.,5
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"I tried this based on the recommendation of some moms in my playgroup. Never realized something like this existed! My 7 month old is more difficult than my first two children to take out in public...this helps tremendously when we go to a restaurant. I just get a piece of fruit and it keeps him occupied the whole meal, and I am happy that I am able to give him healthy alternatives! Great, great, great product! (be advised, though, it can take a bit to get baby used to it)",5
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"After reading the inventors story inside the package, I went out and bought one for grandma's house. She is always nervous about the baby choking on teething biscuits, so this gave her peace of mind. You do need to break most bisquits in thirds to get them in the net, but it is well worth it.As others have said, some fruits are a bit hard to clean out of it, but I found if I hand wash them &amp; get most of the gunk out, then throw them in the dishwasher they are great.",5
Medela CSF Bags - Economy 50 Pack,"I had been using the Gerber bags for quite a while when I ran out and decided to try some of the Medela bags that came with my pump.I frequently just couldn't seem to get the bags to completely seal - and I had NEVER had this problem with the Gerber bags.I always ended up making a mess when trying to use the 'spout' at the bottom of the bag.And the worst part - I didn't realize the twist-ties were cutting into the sides of the bags on more than one occasion.  I took the bag out of the freezer and into the fridge to thaw and ended up with a shelf full of breastmilk.Maybe these bags work for supermoms, but they didn't work well for busy, sloppy me.  Apparently I can handle a ziploc baggie but not a twist tie!",1
Medela CSF Bags - Economy 50 Pack,"I have a full time job and I pump 3 times at work.  Yes, you have to do some setting up for the liners, such as the twist tie, but after about a week, it only takes less than a minute to do.  After your done you just seal it up. I haven't had any leaks.  you do have to be careful when you are pouring it into the bottle as the stream of milk can miss the opening, but after the first spill you can figure out the right way to do it.I think these are great as they take up less space than bottles. I bring home 6 bags everyday and that would be too many bottles to handle.  If you have any questions just email me.  I love these bags.",4
Medela CSF Bags - Economy 50 Pack,The Lansinoh bags worked better for me.  They are designed with a ziplock closure method vs the twist tie Medela method.  They store flat and thaw much faster in the refrigerator than the Medela bags.  I have also had concerns over the use of unsanitary scissors to open the Medela bags and have experienced leaks.  I have been pleased with the Lansinoh bags.,2
Medela CSF Bags - Economy 50 Pack,"This product is  horrible.  I bought these bags thinking that pumping directly into the bag would be great. I have experienced sour milk, leaks, and spills and they were not convenient.  Use the Lansinoh bags, they are by far the best!",1
Medela CSF Bags - Economy 50 Pack,"I bought these bags thinking that I would be using them alot but I only found myself using them when I did not have any more bottles left.  I didn't really like them because when I pour the milk out, I notice that I don't get everything out so easily.  I keep extra bags in my car, at work or in my bag in case I forget to pack a bottle or I run out and I need something to store my breast milk.  But that hardly ever happens because I definately prefer storing milk in the bottles.",2
Medela CSF Bags - Economy 50 Pack,"I bought these thinking it would make my life easier to pump directly into the bag. These bags are nothing but a headache for me. Here's why:1. Setting the bag down when attached to the pump is fine if single pumping but nigh impossible to do with only one hand, as is the case in double pumping. I prefer to use bottles for pumping (because I double pump) and then transfer the milk to a bag.2. The twist tie closure is ridiculous. It simply does not make a leak-proof seal and is quite cumbersome to do. I've had many bags seep milk out. This is probably because I've been lying them down because they are easier to store and thaw when flat. And who uses twist ties anymore anyway? Zip locks are the way to go.3. Getting the milk out of the bag is not as easy as with other bags, either. I've been unable to tear the intended spot to use the pour spout and even if you use scizzors, you have to tip the bag upside down (expecting the twist tie to hold), so you can tear without spilling and aim for the bottle, another challenge in the presence of gravity. My husband just unties the top and pours it out the top but reports that this is difficult to achieve, too. Especially since the bag is flimsy.4. Opening the sealed bag to add the milk is a challenge and I had a bag tear wide open across the face of it during this process.Obviously, I dislike this product. I've gone through a package of them trying to give them a chance but I only come to dislike them more and more. What do I like? Lansinoh bags. They are ziplock and thick, easy to use, easy to freeze and store flat, easy to thaw. And they are a trusted name in breastfeeding. Medela now has a ziplock top that allows pumping into the bag if you want that feature but I have not tried them myself yet.",1
Medela CSF Bags - Economy 50 Pack,"I registered for these baggies, because I had the Medela pump in style double electric pump.  These bags were supposed to fit directly to the pump.  They don't.  They don't make a good enough seal for the pump to work.  I still had to pump into the bottles and then pour them into the baggies.  I have had no problems with leaking.  The twist ties are a bit unhandy, but overall the baggies are good.  I don't know if they are worth the price though.  My suggestion:  try other brands.",3
Medela CSF Bags - Economy 50 Pack,"If you are looking to make a mess, lose milk and get frustrated, these are the bags for you.  First, these bags do no stand up on there own and it is very inconveniant to carry a little cup around to help fill the bag. You have to string the twist-tie into each bag by yourself.  Also you are supposed to tear the little tab on the bottom of the bag to get the milk out.  It's not that easy.  The first time I did it I lost a whole bunch of milk.  Your better off untwisting the tie and pouring it from there.  The worst thing about the bag is that they have leaked a few times that my caregiver was warming up the milk.  This never happened with the other bags on the market.  My favorite is lansinoh.  Another bag thing about these Medela bags are that they are more expensive than the others.  Pass on this and try others.",1
Medela CSF Bags - Economy 50 Pack,I do not like these bags.  The twist tie closure system is cumbersome.  The bags are small.  The plastic is thin and leaks in the freezer when frozen.  The only advantage I can see to these bags is that they are easy to hook to the medella breast pump and pump into directly.,2
Medela CSF Bags - Economy 50 Pack,"While these are easy to use when you are pumping, they tie on the pumps nice and snug, they are not the best for storing.  The tie doesn't make it leakproof and there can be spillage if they tip before they freeze.A better bag is the Gerber seal and go bag.  They fit on the pump but you'll need to either hold the bag so it doesn't slip or use a rubberband to hold it in place.  But, the reason it's better is because it's a ziplock bag.  So, it seals tight and there's no spilling.  The best part about these bags is if you freeze them, you can store them in the freezer lying down so you can have thin bags stacked up, keeping room in your freezer for food for the rest of the family.",2
Medela CSF Bags - Economy 50 Pack,"While I haven't tried other brands, I will say that these bags seem pretty darn sturdy and easy to use, with the ounces shown on the sides. The only thing I don't like about them, is the little &quot;funnel&quot; at the bottom of the bag that you're supposed to tear and use to pour the milk into the bottle. For one thing, you need scissors to tear the tab open (which isn't very sanitary) and then you have to use scissors again, or your teeth to actually tear the plastic to get the milk to come out. It usually rips abruptly causing the milk to spill all over. I tried over and over thinking I was just being stupid, but I finally decided it is MUCH easier to simply take off the twist tie and pour from the top of the bag!All in all though, they work just fine and even have a space at the bottom to write in the date you pumped.",4
Medela CSF Bags - Economy 50 Pack,"I've had absolutely no problems with these breastmilk bags.  They close-up fine, don't leak, and I really like the spout at the bottom for pouring the milk into bottles.  The only thing I don't like is that they are a llittle difficult to organize in the freezer.  I have to go through and check the dates on all the bags to decipher which is the oldest and, therefor, first to be used.  I recently purchased the Lansinoh Milk Mate (if you're interested, check it out at CVS.com) which seems like it will solve that problem.  The Milk Mate will also solve another thing I don't like about using bags, constantly having to buy new bags.  The Milk Mate comes with reusable plastic bottles.  Overall, these Medela Breastmilk Bags do their job very well.  Personally, I'ld prefer a reusable, more organized system but I would still recommend these bags, especially for those who love the convenience of disosables.",4
Medela CSF Bags - Economy 50 Pack,These bags are great!  Easy to use and no clean up!,5
Medela CSF Bags - Economy 50 Pack,"The Lasinoh bags have a double ziplock and are cheaper too.  Also you can find Lasinoh bags at more stores such as K-Mart, etc.  The twist ties with the Medela bags are a pain and I never used them to pump in anyway.",1
Medela Nursing Stool,At 5'2"" it raises my feet to the perfect height. I wouldn't be comfortable in my traditional wooden rocker without it.,5
Medela Nursing Stool,"I used this stool during my baby's first month. It did make breastfeeding a little more comfortable. But after the first month, it became more of a hindrance. You don't need it if you are using a nursing pillow,  like &quot;Boppy&quot;. Pricey. Better to borrow one from a friend.",2
Medela Nursing Stool,"Easy to assemble, comes with everything you need, except for padding.  Just need to get a old towel and fold it to the size of the top of the stool and poof!  No complaints from my wife, a great foot stool.",5
Medela Nursing Stool,"I have to say I am a mother of 3 my youngest is 10 weeks old, I wish I would of had this when I had my other two, and had it for all three of my C-Sections at the hospital. I have been using it now for almost a week, and it definately makes a diffrence. Although when you look at it, it doesnt look like much. Well there isnt much to it but the design is what makes it so wonderful. I am only 5ft 1in in height and I have to say it pretty much accomodates everyone, if you have longer legs you just set the stool further out from what you are sitting on. If you have shorter legs like me you bring it closer to what  you are sitting on. It does make you more comfortable while nursing, after nursing 2 other kids and now nursing my 3rd child I can tell the diffrence. It doesnt really matter how big you are on top either or if they are droopy. Which is something a great deal of women experience when they have breastfed, including me. Sorry about the description of that but just want to give the most accurate comment I can, telling about benefits of using this with normal problems.Overall I would definately recommend it to anyone who breastfeeds. I will definately be using it after I am done even.",5
Medela Nursing Stool,"I nursed our son for about 7 weeks without this, like many mothers, slouching and what not was killing my already injured back, a friend of mine had one and i tried it...loved it! Ordered one for myself and cant do without. Even ordered an addiotional one for my grandparents house that we are going to in the next week in another state! Highly recommend and I will definantly be using this for our other babies to come!Thanks Medela for once again, making an outstanding product...also...If anyone is having problems with there child- reguardless of age-- lactching on or nipple soreness or whatever......I recommend the medela nipple shield, I used it for latch on problems and immediately my son nurses just fine, its for temporary use but I have been using it non stop sense my son was born..keeps me from being sore! You can buy it at Target or anywhere Medela products are sold.I own the pump in style advanced... get this one, its worth every penny!",5
Medela Nursing Stool,This was super simple to put together (3-5 minutes). It is so sturdy. I wouldn't mind having half a dozen of these around the house to use. I imagine that they would work well for getting to the top kitchen cabinet shelf. Also works for leveling out your lap when you need to sit and type on a laptop computer.,5
Medela Nursing Stool,I had my husband buy this 4 days into nursing my son.  It saved my back and I probably would have given up without it.  Worth every penny.,5
Medela Nursing Stool,"I am really happy with this stool.  It is sturdy and the perfect height - really makes nursing easier (no more back pain!).  It's also useful while sitting at the computer and watching TV.  Reasonably priced, and well worth it!",5
Medela Nursing Stool,This product has made it so much more confortable to nurse my son. I even use it when pumping or bottle feeding. It was easy to assimble (no real tools ""required"" but I did bust out the drill to make sure the screws were in there good.)A must have for nursing moms.,5
Medela Nursing Stool,A must have.  You may be able to go without the ottoman if you are in a money crunch.  I fed my son with this exclusively in my rocker for at least the first 8 months.  The ottoman was too high for me and I am 5'6"",5
Medela Nursing Stool,"This stool didn't last long at all. The bottom part split in two. But at least it got me through my heavy nursing days. Would have been nice to still have it though, never know, I may need one again one day...!",2
Medela Nursing Stool,"I purchased this stool 6 weeks into breastfeeding my son. I was having all sorts of trouble feeding him and lots of back pain. I was on the verge of giving up! I went to see a lactation consultant, and she had this stool in her office. Sitting in front of her with my feet up on the stool, I was able to feed him without trouble (she hardly had to &quot;consult&quot;). Once I had this stool at home, things started falling in place.Additionally, this stool has proven useful just as a stool, so your investment will last far longer than during nursing. My mom likes to put her feet up on it when she's simply holding my son.I also want to remark that Medela stands by their product. We discovered that one of the legs on the stool cracked (we think when someone tripped on it during a late-night feeding). I called Medela, and they replaced it immediately.",5
Medela Nursing Stool,"I read all the glowing reviews of this and thought I just had to have it...but I tend to be barefoot mostly in the house and when I try to nurse my infant in the glider and use this, the bottom of my feet get sore from the indentations/ridges (which I guess are there to not let your feet slip) while I'm rocking. The other thing I don't like is that I tend to trip on it when I'm getting out of the chair. And my 5 year old has flipped it while standing on it on one side and scratched up her ankle (her fault, mostly)",3
Medela Nursing Stool,"Can't say enough good things about this stool. I used one at my lactation consultant's office and found it really helpful. It gets your body in the right position and makes nursing so much more comfortable. It's well made and easy to assemble. I am not too tall - 5'3"" with legs on the shorter side. Maybe if you have longer legs you don't need a stool, but I would recommend it to any new mom planning to breast feed. In my experience, anything to make those first few weeks easier - while you and your baby are learning to breast feed - is worth it!",5
Medela Nursing Stool,I bought a rocking chair to use while nursing but did not want the ottoman because I thought it would not be very useful. I put this stool on my registry at the last minute and it is the best thing that I could have done for myself. It makes feeding so much more comfortable. My daughter was only breasfead for a short time and I have used it more now that she is on formula.It takes all of the pressure off of my back and legs. My husband even uses it to rock the baby and himself to sleep! We both recommend this stool as a must have.,5
Medela Nursing Stool,"I have not had my baby yet so its hard for me to say if it really helps with nursing but I figured out that when you put your feet on it, it brings your knees to the right height to nurse.  I didnt see that anywhere in the discription.",5
Medela Nursing Stool,"Do yourself a favor and purchase this item, it will be more helpful to you than any specific nursing pillow.As a first time mother who really struggled with breastfeed I spent a great deal of time in my glider rocking chair working on getting my LO to latch. I was using a kids stepping stool because without it I feet wouldnt touch the ground completely (I'm 5'6). The problem with that stool was it was a flat top and I found myself placing my feet at the edge to  at an angle which was not comfortable if barefoot. In hindsight it was  Also  to high.I made an appt with a lactation nurse because of cracked nipples and problems with latching and she had this or a similar stool. One of my first question was where can I get this? But she didn't know because she had bought it from a closing store in town. My feet rested so comfortably on the stool, at the perfect angle, which supported my posture and helped with my back.After continued struggles at home it dawned on me to Surch the Internet and ofcourse came to find it on Amozon!By the time I purchased it my LO was 2.5months. Feeling more comfortable with nursing I feed her in bed a lot using the laid back aproach (biological nursing?) but when I nurse in a chair/ couch I drag this little baby around because I just can't do without it.Registered or not I now plan on purchasing this for my friends who will be expecting their first baby. It's an item that most people don't know they need!",5
Medela Nursing Stool,"I didn't think a stool could really make it more comfortable to nurse, but I was wrong!  I used this with an old rocking chair and found that my legs were much more comfortable when propped up - especially during those long nights of rocking!  The stool is well-built and comes ready to use in the box.  The natural wood color is attractive and goes with nearly any decor (just so happens that my crib and baby armoire are also natural wood color).  I imagine this would be a great stool to use if you were nursing on a chair or couch that was stationary as well.",4
Medela Nursing Stool,"I never thought I would need this product.  It's a slanted stool, for Pete's sake!  But when my baby was in the NICU for six weeks, they had these there (as well as my Brest Friend boppy pillow, which I also highly recommend!) and there is no way my son would have been able to breast feed without it.  It seems like a minor thing, but it's not.  This stool puts your body into the exact right position for breastfeeding.  For what I call ""picky breast feeders"" this is a lifesaver.  Plus I still use it now that he's weaned.  When I rock him to a dreamy state before bed and naps, this stool is essential......  A plus!",5
Medela Nursing Stool,"For years after I no longer needed it as a nursing stool, I have used this stool to rest my feet on while working at my computer. This allowed me to raise the height of my chair to reduce neck strain when my monitor was a little too high for comfort. The angle reduces strain on the back and makes the whole setup so comfortable. Terrific product.",5
Medela Nursing Stool,"The hospital that I gave birth in had this stool in all of its rooms.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon when searching for something to make nursing in our new rocker more comfortable - I am quite short, so I needed something for my feet to rest on.  I use this stool every night in the middle of the night while nursing and rocking our baby.",5
Medela Nursing Stool,"This is a really good stool.  I have not used any other so I can't make a comparison but I am nursing now and have used it since day one and it is definitely better to use it than to go without it.  I even wish it inclined a little more since I am on the short side.  By the way, it needs to be assembled yourself but it's easy to do.",4
Medela Nursing Stool,"I registered for this stool when pregnant, thinking it would be a nice position-helper while breast feeding, and it is, with one drawback: it tips easily if you put any weight on the edges (top edge or either side). So far, this hasn't been a huge problem, except for making a loud THUMP every time I do it, which sometimes startles the baby. I would just suggest that you avoid ever using it as an actual stool and never step or stand on it, and keep any little kiddos away from it too.Other than the potentially dangerous tipping thing, it is a nice wood piece and went together very easily. As stated before, I would not use it in place of a safer flat stool, but it would be absolutely great under a desk to prop up your feet while working.",3
Medela Nursing Stool,"I love this stool!  I found it essential for nursing my first and my second child.  It's also great just to make it more comfortable to rock, hold, or read to children.  My 4 year old loves to use it to stand on to see her baby sister in the crib, on the changing table, or just to sit on and talk to me while I take care of the baby.  A must have!",5
Peewees Disposable Multi-Use Pads - 36 Pack,"I like to keep a few of these with me for changing in public places or changing an extra dirty diaper. Just the right size, and leakproof.",4
Peewees Disposable Multi-Use Pads - 36 Pack,"I was looking for a pad that I could use to put my baby on without a diaper to ""air"" her bottom out as she is prone to diaper rashes no matter how frequently I change her diaper.  Zinc oxide, yeast creams, ect do not get rid of them completely.  The only thing that works is oxygen! The pediatrician says it is because she has very sensitive skin.  I was hoping for an absorbent pad, but this is far from that.  It is a thin paper sheet with a plastic liner.  If you are looking for something to put down to change a diaper, it does do a good job of protecting your surface from a drops/smears that come with the standard diaper change (and protecting your baby ect) but they are NOT absorbent in the way I was hoping.  I did actually satify my need with a pad from a pet supply store!!! (In case you were wondering).  Anyways, she does great with it under her during tummy time.  Now, I use these peewee pads when we are out and about I need to change her.",3
Peewees Disposable Multi-Use Pads - 36 Pack,"These pads do NOT absorb pee! My baby girl likes to pee when her diaper has just been taken off inbetween me taking the dirty diaper away and putting the new one under her. If she pees on this pad, it runs all over the place, including on her and onto the cotton changing pad that I am trying to protect (defeating the purpose of my buying these pads). The Huggies brand has only 8 in a package, but they are MUCH larger and they absorb pee. Do not waste your money on PeeWee pads!",1
Peewees Disposable Multi-Use Pads - 36 Pack,"This item was exactly what I needed but for some reason I thought I was getting a lot more than I got.  My fault, sure, but it doesn't really excuse selling $3 worth of something for $10, does it?",1
Peewees Disposable Multi-Use Pads - 36 Pack,This was the best purchase!!  These work great and have saved our changing pad from being stained!!!  They are just like the paper they put under your chin at the dentist office - and they work great!!!  We use each one a few times - unless it gets dirty on the first use - then just toss it.  Great to have in the diaper bag as well - don't feel so bad using the changers in the bathroom with these!!!,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I bought it because of the wonderful reviews, but am very disappointed.  I've had messy experiences every single time my son uses the seat.  Even with sitting back as far as he can go, leaning slightly forward, aiming his pee-pee down, the pee goes up the splash guard onto his inner thighs, down the front of the seat and onto the floor.  We've only been using it for three days so far but I have had to clean my son up, myself, the potty seat, and the floor every single time.  I know potty training is daunting, but with these messes, diapers were way easier!  I'm going back to the simple potty ring on the big toilet now.",1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"If you are looking for a bigger potty, this is it. I don't think it's possible to find a larger one. I am so glad I bought this potty. I went to several different stores and put my son on so many potties after I had already bought 3 and took them back. They are all so tiny it is ridiculous!!! I was getting so ticked off. My son was just over 2 1/2 years old and he is skinny. I guess they make the potties like everything else in this micro mini world we live in. This fits my son well and he likes it. I love the built in pee pee guard, he can't remove it. He loves to bring the insert to me and show off his accomplishments. My son is now 31 1/2 pounds and just over 37 inches tall and he is very comfortable on this potty. Thank God and Baby Bjorn for this potty. I don't know what I would have done.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"It's silly how much though effort and research went into our purchase of a potty chair for my daughter, nonetheless it paid off.  Is she trained yet?  No.  But, that doesn't make this any less of a good purchase.  We have the full size Baby Bjorn chair in the bathroom and this is our travel option.  My daughter likes this chair, however it isn't comfortable to sit on for long periods of time.  It's one piece construction makes it easy to clean and prevents the child from getting it on them too.  Baby Bjorn has done it again!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,Simple design that:- allows child to sit rather then have to support themselves (important esp when they start potty training at an earlier age)- the entire seat area comes off so it's easy to clean and dump into toilet and rinse- comes in many colors to suit your liking- bottom has a rubber gasket surrounding the entire outside lip so that it creates good traction- durable and so no worry about breaking this when a child is breaking or when you are moving it a lot,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,This is a great product. It's easy for the babes to sit on comfortably. It's easy to clean b/c it only has one part. And it has that nice rubber ring on the bottom to prevent slides.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This is my second potty purchase and I truly wished it had been my first. My first was the fisher price fun to learn potty, which costs about $5 more and is shaped like a regular toilet with the pretend flush handle. My son thought it was a toy and constantly ""flushed"" to hear the music instead of sitting on it. When this potty arrived and I took it out the box, he grabbed it and said ""mine"" and immediately sat down on it. He started using it the very next day and it's been a success so far. I don't know if it's the potty or if he's just ready to be potty trained (he just turned 3) but I do know that he loves his potty. I highly recommend getting this and forget about the bells and whistles of the fisher price model.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"My daughter is on the thinner side and at 18 months struggles to get comfortable in this chair. She's not able to sit on it without falling in. There's no way that she could sit on this for any length of time because she's having to hold her weight so she doesn't fall in. In addition, the splash guard makes sitting on this super awkward. Another mother wrote about how her daughter needed stitches after cutting her genitals on the splash guard. I can totally see how this can happen. It's not safe for your child to independently seat themselves without some help.",1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I really wanted my boy to train with just the toilet insert, but it was not working. I'm grateful I finally caved and bought this. This smaller kid friendly toilet makes potty training a more manageable task for kids. My son even started pouring his own waste into the regular toilet. He only used this for about three to four weeks. Once he mastered his little potty he was able to go straight to the big one (no inserts).",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I bought this because my current potty will not catch my boy's urine.  The reviews for this said that is was good for a boy.  It is not, unless your boy naturally hangs down.  My boy points out.  I miss the potty chair that I used for other son 13 years ago.  It had a soft and perfect deflector that worked perfectly.",3
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,My son learned to be potty trained and this is only potty seat he uses.  I had bought many others and this is the one he still uses and it's nice it doesn't occupy the big potty an he doesn't get the big potty messy. Great item!!,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Live the color options, the style and well thought out design of this potty. My son is 27 months and fits on the bjorn potty just fine.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"My son started showing potty training ready signs at 16 or 17 months.  I didn't know much about potty chairs so I just went out bought a ""simple"" cheap chair.  The cheap chair was a great introduction for my son but when the time came that he was truly ready he needed a real potty chair and for him it was the BabyBjorn potty chair.  After we received this chair (after doing much research on potty chairs)I spent two days potty training my son with much success.  My son was just under 23 months when he was potty trained and although I give the trophy to my son for being ready, the right potty chair only made my son's job that much easier.  This chair is perfect for boys with the rounded edges of the potty guard so their delicate bits are protected.  The high backing provides support and offers comfort for the child.  The tub of the chair is just the perfect size for little bums.  My son always fell into his other potty chair which made him leary but this just fit perfectly.  And as a plus for the parents-there are only two pieces to this chair which makes for easy cleaning.  My son has been potty trained for a month and even when taking a bath he will get out of the nice warm tub to do his business in his favorite blue chair.  I have already recommended this chair to 3 of my friends who have boys and although I recognize that every child is different and you have to find what works for your child, I would highly recommend this chair to anyone in the potty training stages whether you have boys or girls.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Best chair I found for potty training my son, the front of the bowl came up much higher than other models we had tried.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"My father had made my daughter a potty, but it had the pot that slid from behind under the seat.  So there were little spills from time to time.  I bought this potty and my daughter loves it!!  It's so easy for her to pick up and flush and there is never a mess.  Definitely worth every penny!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Easy to clean, attractive, nice back and side support and a safe urine catcher.  What more could I ask for.  Son likes it and the Potty book I got to go with it is great too.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,This is the only potty chair we used with our little one.  We didn't use bells and whistles.  We didn't use stickers.  This was all she needed.  It was very ergonomical for her little frame.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,We initially bought a potty chair from a local store. Each and every time my son used it I had to take it apart and clean every crack and crevice. I read the reviews on this potty and am I glad!! We ordered it from Amazon and the day it arrived my husband called me to tell me it was the best purchase we had ever made!! It's simple two piece design make it a breeze to keep clean. With the first potty my son would end up going everywhere because the splashguard was not high enough. This potty chair is almost oblong in shape and it keeps everything where it should be. It it large enough for my avearage size 2 1/2 year old boy. This is worth every penny we spent on it.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I like the simple design. I just need tips on getting my grandson to actually go potty in it. He likes to sit on it, but likes to potty outside!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"If you're looking for a potty chair this would probably do the trick. We never ended up using it as we didn't want one more thing to transition from, and something else to clean. My daughter did think it was fun, but only ever used it as pretend.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I was looking for a potty seat that would fit my son - he's a little big for his age and all the other chairs had teeny tiny holes for the...poop.  Plus, all of the deflectors would end up hurting him.  This chair definitely fit the bill.  The hole is big enough, the deflector is built in and doesn't hurt him at all and on top of all of that, it's SO easy to keep clean.  I would recomend this potty seat to everyone!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,I had bought a different potty for my little girl and she would not even sit on it. I bought it because it played music and had a flushing sound. She did not like it at all. She LOVES this one. It has a back on it (unlike some) and she sits on it just like a little chair. It is comfortable for her and easy for her to get up and down on.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We had to buy 3 potties before going for this one. We tried: Graco with soft seat, but its splashguard comed right off; the 1st years 3-in-1 potty had a hole that was located too close to the back thus making it very uncomfortable for a boy, because everything got mashed; and a musical potty by safety 1st, which leaked. This potty finally works! But I am so surprised to find that there is no perfect potty on the market! Looks like consumer reports haven't done much job; one way or the other, big brands have left out our little kid's bottoms with POOR CHOICES, of which the best(truly) here to present - baby bjorn potty chair...hope kids of my kids will do better.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"It functions. If my 2 year old boy pees in it the spray is minimal, the rubber pads keep it from sleeping, and its easy to clean. However he hates the potty. The seat sticks to his butt and is made of hard plastic so is very uncomfortable. He will perch above the seat using his arms to hold him off the seat rather then sit on it. I have since gotten the boon one and it is much more comfortable and he sits on it much better.",3
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,This is the only potty chair my 2 year old Grandson will use. My daughter had to cart it back and forth to day care once a week. Before his visitfrom KS. to MA. I purchased this particular one. I lined up the new one and 2 other ones I had prior for his sister's potty training and he only used this new one. It is easy to clean also. It's on Grandma's favorite's list.Grandma from MASSACHUSETTS,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I did a lot of research before making the purchase. And this one turned out to be the best!!!It is perfect for a boy. No spill at all. Ever since we got it, my 2-year old son has been using it every day. He loves it! He has never pooed in the diaper ever since.Highly recommend!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I started using this potty with my daughter when she was just able to sit up on her own.  The high back was more helpful then, than it is now, but it's still nice to have the high back.  She likes to lean back and throw her arm over the back.  She thinks she's so cool when she sits on her big girl potty.I like the &#34;handle&#34; on the front shield because my daughter hangs onto it and leans slightly forward when using the potty for #2.I like the design of the bowl and how it fits in the potty.  No leaks.  The potty chair my mom has, if my daughter is at a certain angle somehow it leaks onto the floor.  That has never happened with this potty chair.PROS:- High back to help support baby- No-slip bottom keeps potty from sliding on tile floorCONS:- Haven't thought of any yetI bought a second one of these to leave at day care.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"My son is 20 months and figured it was time to start to potty training. The best thing about the chair is, he's not afraid of it.Just be aware it has some size to it. Other than that it's been GREAT!",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,I just bought this potty and the first time my 20 month daughter saw it she said ""potty"" and promptly urinated in it! Can't beat that! Looks very comfy too.,4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"With five young children in our home, we have two of these Baby Bjorn potties. With constant use (and abuse) they still look brand new! They are easy to clean (I have even stuck the bowl portion in the dishwasher) and easy to transport. My kids LOVE the bright colors which make potty training easier :) Well worth the money!!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,We have tried a number of potties before I came across this product. The ones we purchased prior to the BabyBjorn were either uncomfortable for sitting or difficult to empty out. What I like most about this potty is the raised round support. it makes it easy to start early with the child. Our 15 month old girl uses it as her chair in the bathroom. The raised front of the bowl serves as handle for emptying as well as to prevent splashing from boys. This is a functionally designed potty in every respect.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This chair saved the day. He has the feeling of being hugged; Therefore, he will sit longer and have better luck. Also, the cleanup is better. There is less spill.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,Bought for our 30 month old grandson. .He likes it. .He sits and holds a few toys while &#34;making&#34;..it cleans up very well..no issues..I should get 2 more,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,We love this potty...it's not complicated like other pottys. It's easy to empty and clean...the seat seams comfortable for my daughters tiny butt... She loves to sit on it...glad we chose this one over the other cheap pottys.,4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I have twin boys that are 3 and I love this chair.  It doesn't have a lid or removable splash gurad.  I have two other sets of chairs that the twins only play with.  Putting the lids up and down, taking out the removable seat and catch basin, etc.This simply constructed unit has no corners or edges.  It has smooth contours including the splash guard that does not come off and is attached to the catch basin.  The catch basin is a combination seat/emptying pail which enables you to easily remove and empty.  It is easily cleaned and because of the simple design less appealing to play with.I think the best feature is the smooth built in splash guard which you need with boys.This seat does not convert to a toilet seat for the bathroom toilet, which I think doesn't work anyway - on the other potty chairs I purchased the seats slide and flop when you put it on the real toilet and then becomes unsafe.  I recommend the Babybjorn toilet trainer for that.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This is a basic potty with the pot that can be removed for easy cleaning so it's easy to wash and clean but my poor kid stands up from sitting on this for mere minutes and has deep red marks on her legs and bottom, it's uncomfortable!  I'm going to order one with a cushy seat!",2
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I chose this chair based on its reviews, and I am glad that I did! I can't speak for how it works for a boy, but it seemed to be really comfortable for our daughter. It's easy to clean and looks nice in the bathroom, instead of looking like just another piece of baby gear. I also like that there weren't any crazy sounds or anything like that since it made the chair seem like a more realistic potty.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We did MUCH research on potty chairs and decided on BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Potty Chair,which I have NO regrets... Our son wasn't quite ready to start but the sturdyness will be useful as he approaches his 2nd birthday and we start full force. The reason I bought? No bells and whistles, sturdy and of a quality name. Id buy this again!!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"The high back and sturdy base make this chair perfect for little ones just getting the hang of using the potty. Be aware that with a boy the splash guard might not catch all the pee, but you can help him learn how to sit correctly and then it doesn't happen!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I run a children's consignment shop and this is the most popular potty to buy/sell second-hand. That said, there are two design flaws that I'd love to see fixed: One, when a boy pees standing up into this potty and hits the splash guard in the back, the urine runs into the cracks between the blue and white pieces and onto the floor. Why not make it so that the potty seat somehow slips *under* the blue spash guard so that the inevitable misfires are directed to the right place?  Second, the bottom of the potty consists of two edges with a void inbetween -- if the bottom edge were instead solid, it would prevent liquid from getting up in that void, and cleaning would be easier.",3
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This potty is just great.  My baby has been using this since she was 9.5 months old.  I love the fact that it has a chair-back so she doesn't need me to physically support her when she's on it.  All I have to do is watch her nearby.  It's really well made and very sturdy.  Also, the basin is big enough that it holds everything without spills and mess.  She doesn't mind sitting on it for 10 monutes in the mornings to do her thing...and she does pretty much without fail.  We haven't had to change a poop diaper for weeks now.  One of the most useful items I bought for the baby!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This potty is small but portable. Works well with boys since it has the high guard in front. Easy to clean and the white color is nice so kids can see what they've done. Another plus is that the plastic is able to be recycled when you are finished with it. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,My 14 month old LOVES his new potty chair and goes potty just about every time we put him on it! This whole potty training thing is easier than I thought it would be with this chair!,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,After seeing all the reviews I decided to purchase this potty for my son. It's very sturdy and easy to clean.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"i really like the simplicity of this chair, with potty training my first, i tried all the chairs with buttons, noises, etc. which didn't really appeal much to my toddler after the first couple of times.  they were harder to clean because of all the little pieces and were uncomfortable and left marks on him.  this is much easier to clean, keep clean, and very comfortable for the little ones to sit on.  i gave it 4 stars because i havent started potty training my second yet, other moms who recommended it to me, say they love it.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"After going through the potty learning process with 4 kiddos, I've got a handle on it. Wipe, Flush, Wash is easy to say, tough to get down pat. This is my 3rd potty seat. My first was a gift, handmade from wood with a slide in insert that was a huge pain to remove without smearing you know what everywhere. It was pretty, but not practical. The second was a cute little Fisherprice one with a fancy electric sound of flushing when you pressed the ""silver"" handle. The silver quickly wore off and all the cracks and crevices were impossible to clean.When bubs #4 was ready, I was looking for a new seat. One that was portable, easy to use, and most importantly, easy to clean. With all those small parts and tight corners, some pottys really lose their shine after a while, both figuratively and literally. After some research, I decided to purchase this one. I can honestly say that it is the only potty I love. :) Simple, portable design, bright, fun colors, and a comfortable, easy-to-clean seat certainly do make this the best potty EVER!The BabyBjorn is easy to clean, and it's contoured seat is the most comfortable I've seen. (Honestly, getting a potty learner to sit on something with a hole in the bottom is hard enough, why make the seat uncomfortable?) The side handles help them to ""aim"" their behind better, and the insert easily lifts out for dumping and detailed cleaning, and their are no corners, anywhere, for dirt to hide in. It's made of extremely durable plastic AND has a non-skid base on the bottom so it doesn't slip when your kiddo sits down.One word of caution: Although it is difficult for the insert to be placed incorrectly in the base, it is possible. When this happens your little one's bum may get pinched. This has only happened once in our 2 years of using this potty. Generally it falls into place easily.Buy it. You will not regret it.

BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,Great potty for girls! My daughter is 23 mo-old and took right away to her yellow potty! She is still at the early stage of just sitting on it to get used to it but it is great! I used another brand for my other daughter and it wasn't as easy to clean. Also the seat doesn't pinch like a few others that we tried that are the more 'character' style. I wanted to distinguish it from being another toy.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I think what makes this potty work well for my twins is the high arms.  They like to sit on it and started the day it arrived.  Also, it arrived in one day.  But they fought over the right to sit on it and I was made to buy a second one.  I have them in white and blue.There is something about this potty that makes a little one understand its purpose.  I couldn't believe how comfortable they are for them sitting on it, due to the arms and back and overall design.  I think the price was favorable and feel great about the purchase of these two potty chairs.They're right now in the early stages of learning.  We'll be using these for awhile I expect.",3
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I had another potty seat I was trying to use that my daughter potty trained on and it didn't work so well with my son (things shot out that shouldn't have shot out...). This has a high enough guard on it so we've had no problems with things not staying in the potty.  It seems comfortable and I like the back on it.  My other potty seat didn't have a back and I think it's safer for the smaller kids.  This potty is a little bigger than my other, but it's not too bad.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,It fits snug on the tile floor and keeps the pee where it needs to be. Easy to clean up. Our son is tall for his age (99%) and weighs 29 pounds. He sits on this with room to spare quite comfortably. Happy with my purchase.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We bought another potty with a detachable soft seat which can be used on a regular toilet and the potty can convert to a step.  Fisher Price maybe?  We thought it was great and put up with the pee leaking out and the guard that didnt work untill one day no matter how much I cleaned it, it smelled like pee.  We found out the cushion detaches from the handles and was a nice little pocket for pee to dry in.  After reading recomendations from Toddler Bargains (the best book!) we decided on the little Bjorn potty.  Mainly due to the one piece construction.  Once it arrived we were a bit surprised to see how small it was and my sons knees were nearly up to his chest.  Oddly enough, he LOVES it.  It goes to show you, they know what they like better than us.  The straddle design is so much smarter than the stupid splash guards.  We rarely have flyaway pee to deal with now (though thats normally due to sticking issues... boy stuff I dont understand cause Im a girl).  The entire potty is nearly the same size as the removable bucket from our other one, so carrying the whole thing to dump isnt an issue.  I really just love how there is no cracks or anything to clean.  Its a simple swipe with a lysol cloth and were all done!  Leave it to Baby Bjorn, they always know what works best.  (oh, by the way, we often forget that its easier to push things out when our knees are up, but think child birth, and the stomach flu...) We have decided to buy three, one for the car, one upstairs and one downstairs.  It works wonderfully in the car too!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I've owned one of the Baby Bjorn potties before, but must have lost it during a move or maybe even given away? This is a replacement for a potty I already had and was greatly looking forward to using again with my toddler son. As others have said, easy to clean and sterilize due to simple design, and comfortable to sit in.I did want to say, though, that the packaging was weird. The potty arrived very quickly thanks to my Prime membership, but upon opening the box I found just some paper filler, and the potty in a plastic bag. No baby bjorn box. I'm sure it's new - I examined the pieces closely and found nothing suspect. I'd just feel more confident with this had it arrived packaged in an original box. This is not the sort of item you'd want to buy if you knew it had been returned already used. Amazon's description does say they don't accept this on returns, so okay, but still....",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"There's no need for buttons that play music or a 'play' flusher that makes sounds.  My son was very distracted by all the bells and whistles of another brand, that he didn't even want to try it.  He absolutely loves his Baby Bjorn potty chair!  We got one in white and a stool to match.  It took him one week to learn how to use it!  He's only 19 mos. now and only uses it before and after the bath (which is a great start!)  It's a simple design and he looks pretty comfy in it.  The part you take out and clean doesn't lift up when he stands up (like other chairs I've heard of).  I just throw out the waste in the toilet, rinse it out in the sink, then wipe clean and dry with a Clorox disinfecting wipe.  So easy... buy one now!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,,4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"As a Mom, I wanted a simple to clean potty.  Just a frame with a removable bowl.  No sliding bowl underneath; no music; no paper holder.I picked up one at the store that was very simple to clean.  It also converted to a stool and seat for the toilet.  Well, we had it about a month before the little boy urinated in it.  It shot right over the top of the guard.After reading other reviews on Amazon, I ordered the Baby Bjorn.  My 2 yr old (26 months) trained himself in about 8 days after we got the new potty.  No messes.  Easy to clean.Side note - 3 weeks later, he prefers to use the 'big potty' and the Baby Bjorn sits idle as an option.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We started out with theSafety 1st 1-2-3 Teach Me Training System in Whitethat was given to us from a friend. Well my son couldn't even sit on it without screaming bloody murder! It was pretty crazy, actually.. He was about 10-11 months at the time, and the only thing I could figure was that either the hole was too big and hurt his bottom, it was too tall to sit on it correctly [he's usually in the 10-20ish % for height] OR he just couldn't balance his weight because of it. I heard several recommendations for the baby bjorn from other moms. I was able to find them at Target and Babies R Us to see them in real life, as well as a similar version by baby bjorn that was maybe 2cm shorter but had no 'back' to it.We received the larger version off his Amazon wish list for Christmas, by this time he was 13 months but size hadn't changed much. We tried sitting him on it several times right after opening and we had no issues AT ALL. He had no problem sitting and keeping his balance. He could also stand up easier by putting both hands on each side of the backrest, much better than the other potty we had. I will update more when potty training is in full swing and it gets more frequent use. But so far so good.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Awesome!!!! My son who is 40lbs and only 2 years old can't fit onto any other seat. Plus this one is soooo  great for boys, there is plenty of space and the guard in front makes it really easy!!! I love it!!!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This potty chair is wonderful.  It has a nice, easy to clean design that blends well with any bathroom.  It's a good size too.  I also like the fact that it doesn't slide around.  It has rubber on the bottum that grips any type of floor.  I would recommend this item.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,this was the perfect potty chair to start my grandson on his way to wearing his 'big man pants'thank u for a terrific product,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I had a Safety 1st potty that I just hated before I bought this Baby Bjorn potty.  It leaked, its round opening was WAY too small, and I had a ton of problems with my son leaking all over the front and on to the floor.  Plus it came apart in many pieces and had lots of spots bacteria could hide.  The Baby Bjorn takes care of all the problems I had with the Safety 1st potty!The simple construction is so sanitary and easy to clean.  There are no little places for bacteria to collect.The opening is bigger than other potty chairs and oblong instead of round, so no more pooping on the seat.  This alone would have sold me on this potty.The splash guard is great for boys.  No more peeing off the front of the potty and no flimsy detachable splash guards that flip down into the seat.It has a nice rubber grip on the bottom to keep it in the same place on the floor.Another plus is that it's nice looking and blends in with the rest of the bathroom.I'm very happy with the quality and design of this potty and I have NO complaints!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,Nice design and easy for child to sit on.Does not take up much room in bathroom.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I like how it is a basic potty with no frills.  Currently DS is not using it yet, but I can't wait to get out of cloth diapers!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We owned our last blue babybjorn potty for over 10 years. It survived 4 children.  Unfortunately, it was accidentally cleaned with a substance that ruined the coating.We decided to go with a bjorn again and we are please with this one.  It is a large potty seat so this will fit a large child.  The white part removes easily so that it can be given a quick rinse.A child can lean back and not fall off the potty. The seat is big enough so a child can sit easily without hurting themselves.Overall, I am please with the purchase.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I purchased three of these chairs so that I could have one on each floor of the house. It was the best chair I could find on the market and had some of the best reveiws I saw.  It is overall a decent potty chair.  I have two young boys. One successfully potty trained on this chair and one is still in the process.  While my overall view is positive and I would buy it again, here are my areas of concern:-My kids didn't want to sit and go potty. They wanted to stand like daddy and big brother.  On occasions where they have missed the bowl and hit the back of the chair, the liquid leaks underneath the bowl and goes right to the floor/towel/mat whatever happens to be underneath at the time.-While this chair only has two pieces, there are many ledges that urine can get to that can create colonies of bacteria.  I just wanted to mention this because I have to clean the entire chair every single time just to make sure nothing was missed.- The bowl could be a bit deeper for #2.  Enough said.This is otherwise a great seat and I would buy it again.",3
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This was my second purchase of a BabyBjorn potty chair.  I had bought my daughter one when she began potty training my 2 year old grandson, but not one for my home.  I was using a potty insert and a stool and found little Ben was having trouble getting on.  I asked how the BabyBjorn was working and she told me he uses it only.  She was so right, I am so happy to have purchased this; mine is blue and her's is red.  He loves it; it is sturdy, easy to clean, and does not move when he sits down or gets up.Wonderful item and I highly recommend for the daunting task of potty training!  I plan on this being my number #1 baby shower gift from now on!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"It took some searching but finally I found a potty that didn't sing or dance or have a mini toilet roll holder, and that was large enough to be comfortable for a nearly 3 year old boy.  This potty is perfect and simple - doesn't slip, doesn't topple, has a slightly elongated shape which is great for the older toddler, is easy to clean and thank goodness - doesn't sing!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We ordered three of these potties for our daughter. They arrived just wrapped in plastic inside an amazon box. No pretty packaging, no instruction manual in 20 languages. Just the product. At first, I was worried I had ordered a used one... but I guess that's just how the Sweede's do it. Now, I'm just a Tennessee redneck. I don't buy into all the fancy &#34;European&#34; pictures of the European couples with their kids in  front of some European landmark like you see on their website. I don't go around to all my friends and brag about my BabyBorjn purchase and try to pronounce it all European like to try and impress them. I do, however, like simplicity. I don't like buttons, flaps, lids, and all the gadgets on the other models I looked at. This guy is just a simple piece of plastic and should do the trick nicely. I'm surprised they didn't plaster it with warning signs that it should be placed on the floor and not the kitchen counter. I guess the Sweedes are smarter than us and just know how to raise their kids using common sense. In any event, we'll give it a try and see if we can stop keeping Huggies in business. If it works before her 2nd birthday I might even look up how to pronounce the darn thing.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We were using a Bjorn Little Potty (which they don't make anymore) for a long time. But as my son grew, he kept overshooting and it was becoming a problem. At Grandma and Grandpa's house they had the Bjorn Smart Potty, which seemed to work better for him. I figured the Bjorn potties have been working well for us, lets try the top of the line Potty Chair!And its working great, the bowl rinses easily. Sometimes a little pee dribbles over the side, but its easy to rinse the whole chair in the tub. I keep it on a little rug to catch the dribbles and just throw that in the wash as needed. Any potty (with boys using it) is going to have occasional dribbles.And my son was pretty excited when it arrived!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We are currently training our 2nd child.  With our first, we had 3 in diapers, giving us MAJOR motivation to get him potty trained, so we tried almost every seat out there.  Most of them were okay, but just got nasty quckly, were hard to disinfect, or were uncomfortable for my son.  The ones with the removable splash gaurd are not gentle and can scrape a child's sensitive parts.  Those were awful.  We were ""potty training"" for a full year before we finally saw the BabyBjorn potty chair in a local botique, and DS immediately sat in it.  He chose blue, and we took it home.  Within a week, he was trained, and began using the ""big boy seat"", so we saved the seat for our daughter.  It was incredable!  Now our 23 month old daughter is training.  We bought her this white babybjorn seat for our downstairs bathroom, with the blue upstairs.  She has been ""training"" for 6 days now, and is almost completely day trained!This seat is by far the best in our experiences.  Here's why:  1. the seat has a higher back and sides, which gives the child support while sitting down, standing up, or simply sitting there.  2. It is NOT easy to tip! several of the others we tried tipped without much effort when our child was putting pressure on the sides trying to sit down or stand.  3. It is super easy to clean - there aren't a bunch of seams to gather gunk, it's easy to wipe down with a clorox wipe and be done.  It's also super easy to take the little bucket out, and soak in clorox or hose down.  4. Kids can choose what color they want!  This was such a big deal to my children --- also, they are solid colors that can look nice with your bathroom.  The surface is also nice that your child can decorate the back with cute stickers if wanted.  5. It works for children of all different sizes!  My son was 40"" and 42lbs when potty training, and my daughter is 25lbs and a little shrimp, and this seat fit them both WONDERFULLY.Overall, having tried MANY seats, this one was the absolute best for both our children, and I would highly reccomend it to anyone in need of a seat for potty training success~!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This potty is wonderful and perfect for boys. The design is incredibly simple and easy for the kid to pick up the bowl and dump it in the toilet, then return it to the chair. The little shield in front blocks the spray that can occur with little boys. We have two potties in the household and this is superior by far.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We started &#34;potty practice&#34; at about 21 months for my daughter. She's small for her age but showing signs of readiness. We borrowed another seat to get started and quickly learned all the &#34;extras&#34; were a distraction -- the other chair had a removeable foam seat and a lid. Not anything fancy, but she was curious and explored the seat every time instead of doing her business. We've switched to this chair and does MUCH better. It's easier to clean and just the right size.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,My son loves the color and seems very comfortable sitting on the potty. He can still play with his toys and be comfortable because there is a back a sides he can push up from.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,My first three children were born in Sweden.  We have used this potty for ever!  My oldest is now 20 so we passed it along to friends some years back.I will definitly buy one for my grandchildren.  It is easy to keep clean and even easier to store!  No extra parts/nothing to break either!,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"My 2.5 year old just wants to play with this and not use it as a potty. She discovered that the seat insert makes a great cowboy hat and is also fun to stand in and push around the house and put her toys inside and underneath it. I tried every rookie mom mistake to get her to take it seriously and nothing seems to be working. She only wants to potty train on the real toilet and, hey, that's not a bad thing. Just wish I knew before I bought it! I'd suggest starting with the real toilet and a seat to fit on top before buying this. Otherwise, it's a great potty chair! I think it's well made, a good size and has a nice simple design. That's why I gave it 4 stars.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I bought the Babybjorn Potty Chair because the first seat I purchased didn't allow my petite 2-1/2 year old's feet to touch the floor when she sat down. The last thing I want to deal with is the aftermath of a fight between my child and a very full and somewhat unstable potty chair. The Babybjorn potty allowed her the independence to sit (with her feet flat on the floor) and stand without a struggle.The chair itself is a nice design, no sharp edges and plenty of curves. It has rubber on the base to keep it from sliding around the bathroom floor. The removable bowl is large and the top flares out into a full seat. The other potty's bowl would sometimes stick to my daughter's legs and cause a spill when she stood. The Babybjorn seat stays put!Clean up couldn't be easier. Actually, it could be easier if my daughter would use the grown-up potty, but if she's going to use a portable kids potty seat this one is probably as easy to clean as it gets.  The bowl easily lifts out. I empty it into the toilet, rinse it, wipe it with a Clorox wipe, drop it back into the Babybjorn, and I'm finished until she decides to use it again.If the potty starts to get a bit dusty, it's very easy to wipe down. There aren't a lot of small spaces to keep clean like our other potty chair.Kids are so unpredictable. My daughter learned to go potty on this seat, but we still had the other potty around. As soon as she mastered the potty, she refused to use the Babybjorn and started using out other potty chair. Maybe it was because she grew taller and it finally fit. Maybe because she's trying to annoy Mommy. Maybe I'll never know.The one thing I do know is that in the beginning she exclusively used this chair and she did learn how to use the potty.  And the one thing I'm most happy with is the ease of cleaning up that I get from this chair.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This is the third potty I've purchased for my son.  The first one was made by Parents, and it tipped over the first time my son sat on it.  The second was First Years Elmo 3-in-1, and the cup pinched his behind in 3 places leaving cuts.  This one is great.  Although my son was hesitant to go on it at first (which I attribute to his experience with the Elmo potty), he fits nicely on it.  The other potties were too narrow from front to back, and I had to adjust him several times to get him situtated so that he could use the front guard.  The seat lifts out as the cup which lends itself to not pinching his bottom; and easy clean up.  It's low enough to the ground that his legs fit too.  The back and arm supports fit well also.  It's a solid construction and good buy.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I can't say enough good about this potty chair.  It's inexpensive (but very well made), SUPER easy to clean, has a very comfortable splash guard for boys and is comfortable (I'm assuming).  I originally bought the Safety 1st Potty Chair/stool.  Don't like it at all.  Tough to clean (lots of spaces for urine to get) and I don't think it's very comfortable as my son refused to sit on it.  Within 20 seconds of sitting on the Baby Bjorn he peed.  Refused for weeks to do that with the Safety 1st.  Great product.  Can't say enough good about it.From a parent's stand point, it's the best b/c it's soooo easy to clean.  I'm not clean freak, but this is a huge benefit with anything in the bathroom.Kudos to Baby Bjorn for a simple product.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This design couldn't be any more simple!  Two pieces of plastic. An insert that removes easily to empty out! Must have been designed by Apple's JONATHON IVE!  Now, if I could only get my little boy to use it a bit more often!  Still working on that one!  Great chair.  Highly recommended!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"There's nothing particularly remarkable about this potty except that it works EXACTLY as it should, without ANY drawbacks. After you try a few potty chairs for your kids, you realize that is remarkable in itself. Easy to use, easy to clean, very sturdy, has NEVER tipped.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"It shipped fast and in perfect condition (new).  My little baby boy sits on it and seems very comfortable and with no problems. Perfect height, easy to clean and affordable. I highly recommend it and comes in many colors.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We bought this because my youngest daughter won't train on a potty seat on the toilet, so we thought this might help her transition from diapers.  It's just plastic.  I had hoped there'd be a way to put a plastic liner in the hole part so we could just take the liner off instead of having to clean the plastic bowl, but unless we want her to sit on the liner, that's not an option.  Oh well, it's a big overpriced piece of plastic.",3
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,I have a son and this is perfect!!! He doesnt pee out of the potty and its easy to clean since it is solid plastic.  It isnt distracting like the cartoon pottys so he just used it for its purpose and that's it!!,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"How can the simplest of potty seats be the most expensive?  In this case, you must pay for the simplicity and functionality of this design.  We looked at many other potty seats with music, lights, lids, and countless other useless bells and whistles.  You would have to clean those things at a car wash to get in all the crevices and moving parts.  This seat is stable, simple, and easy to clean - just like the one I had when I was 2.  I guess no one but Baby Bjorn thinks simple functionality is the way to go.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,I tried a over the toilette seat for my 2 year old but we have the chair height toilets in our house and I think being that far up off the floor scared him.  I purchases this potty seat to try and he likes to sit on it and has pooped in the potty several times.  The splash guard is built in so it is not uncomfortable as the splash guard on the over the toilette seat one I have.  We are still in the learning stages but so far I think I made the right decision after researching so many different potty chairs.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Our first potty for our daughter had one of those squishy foam-type seats. We thought that would be more comfortable, but soon realized it just irritated her bum. It had a huge reservoir, was a pain to dump and clean, and that foam part was always getting dirty and could never be completely cleaned.A friend had a Baby Bjorn, and seemed happy with it, so we gave it a try. My daughter chose her own color - I love that there are so many options - and we ended up with a green one. She loves this potty. It seems comfortable, and she doesn't get that red ring around her bottom from sitting on it. And best of all, it's SO EASY TO CLEAN. The reservoir is compact and can be rinsed in a small bathroom sink, but holds plenty. If you forget to dump it once, it won't overflow on the second use.My first daughter still prefers this potty over using the adult one. She's 3.5, and big for her age. The size of this potty is very versatile, and I think it will last her a good while longer if she needs it to.Now my second daughter is getting to the potty-training age (18 months), and we've invested in a second one in her favorite color, yellow (it's actually a lovely shade). The same potty that can accomodate my preschooler works just as well for my little toddler, and that's a great feature.I have zero complaints about the Bjorn potty. It's absolutely worth the extra money.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"My daughter likes to poop and pee in this.  It is easy to clean, and replace.  Almost too easy.  Sometimes, my two year old will try and do all that on her own, which can cause larger cleaning excercises.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This potty is the best. My daughter can fit on it easily unlike her previous potty. It's not the most attractive potty, very simple/plain. Overall it serves it's purpose.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I've been deciding betwieen this one and the smaller version, and I'm so happy I went with the one that has taller back support. I started using it with my 5.5 month doughter and she loves it, she seems very comfortable on it. We've been using it every day, for over a month now. She goes between 5 to 11 times a day. I still get to change 2-3 wet diapers a day, but for the past 16 days she went #2 only in her potty and not even once in the diaper.It's very easy to clean. Perfect size. Love it.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This is the ONLY potty I've found that's perfect for boys! The pee-pee guard is integrated to the seat, so it won't fall off, and is high enough to ""keep it all in"" if you know what I mean! =) I had to order 3 since it's seriously the only one he'll even sit on anymore! We have 4 different types/brands, but he (and I) hates them all. This one is truly THE BEST. Super-easy to dump and clean, he likes to do it himself, and the bottom of the potty is rubber-lined so it doesn't slide around when he sits down/gets up. It's also a really good size ""bowl"", some are waaay too small to neatly go potty in. AWESOME potty and the only one I would ever reccomend!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I have bought 3 potty chairs so far trying to find one my two year old will sit on without acting like a cat being put in a bath!  This is the only one so far that we have succeeded in getting her onto.  It is attractive in the red color (though I wish the removable bowl was also red instead of white).  It is easy to clean, difficult to tip over and the raised sides (arm rests?) help her to get in and out comfortably.  Great quality product!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I was excited about this potty - very stylish, simple, cute.  However, my son refuses to use it.  He pushes it all over the house as if it were a car.  He will only use the ""big potty.""",3
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"After purchasing 4 other potty chairs with different bells and whistles it seemed that the hole was rather small on alot of the potty chairs.  My child is of average size so I couldn't understand why.  I noticed them using this potty chair at the daycare and was immediately on a mission to find it.  I have the yellow one and it is perfect. Just the right height, just the right size hole.  Best of all super easy to clean b/c it only has 2 pieces to it!  I want to buy another to put in the spare bathroom.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This is a great potty. Comfortable and safe for the child, easy to clean. Buy it.I would like to refute those those who say it's not for boys, because this is an excellent potty for boys and for girls.The complainers are unrealistic in teaching a boy to stand to pee in a POTTY. OF course it made a huge mess!! Too low, wrong shape and size of container, etc.  Teach your boy to stand to pee in the TOILET. I can't imagine letting my sons stand and pee into a potty. That's just rediculous. My sons have never even tried to pee standing at the potty. Makes no sense.All the little boys I know learned to ""go potty"" peeing and pooping sitting down on a potty. Then later they transition to sitting on the toilet sometimes, (body size makes the difference here) and at some point starting to stand to pee at the toilet as they have seen Daddy or big brother do.I started training just under 2 years. After they were fully trained (it takes a few weeks/months) my sons used both the potty and the toilet, whichever they felt more comfortable with. By age 4, they used the toilet exclusively. just FYI.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,It does the job.  She was potty trained within a month I think due to being able to leave this in the livingroom so she could always see it.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,My 10 months old bay just likes this potty. It is a very good choice.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"My daughter is 18 months and used this potty chair for the first time this evening.  It's a decent seat.  It fits her well, and she seems comfortable with using it.  I'd say it's a decent value as well.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"My son is now 2 years 8 months, and we started out potty training on the green frog.  It's known as ""ribbit"".  Well ""ribbit"" wasn't very deep, and didn't have any type of rubber gripping on the bottom of it. He seemed to be getting way too big for it.  So my biggest concern was depth, and height of the back.  I still wanted him to feel safe, but not pee pee over the edge.  I am very pleased with the depth of this one.  It fits him really good now.  I'm a little worried about it fitting for the next 3 months, but we're working on it and I hope that he is potty trained in the next few months.  I like the bottom of this Baby Bjorn because it does have rubber edging all along the bottom edge so it doesn't slide around the bathroom.  It also has a really good front potty blocker.  I would especially recommend this for parents with boys.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I had very high hopes for my son in terms of potty training so this pretty and sleek BabyBjorn potty was purchased when he was less than a year old. Needless to say, it stood unused for quite some time until he realized that in order to become a 'big boy' he needed to master the very adult art of toilet training. Here are the reasons why I think this potty served as a positive enforcement in his determination to achieve this complex task:1.  The potty has no useless bells and whistles. I remember going through the toilet isle at my local Babies'R'Us and could not comprehend why a child would need flashing lights and music to sit on a potty.  Toilet should serve one purpose and one purpose only (I won't spell out exactly what), and too much stimulation takes away from the real function of the apparatus.2. BabyBjorn people really understand male anatomy. My mom got another potty for when my son visited and returned it after the first try when her living room rug ended up covered in you know what. Boys need higher tabs in the front of the potty, and BabyBjorn is an excellent example of good design.  We've never had an accident at home.3. The potty is easy to clean. It consists of two parts: the base chair and a removable bowl. There are practically no nooks and crannies for dirt to accumulate making it very useful for a busy mom.4. My son is very comfortable sitting on it. The high back support and no slip rubbery bottom make it a happy and easy experience for him.  It's so durable that he usually just uses it by himself without me present when the inspiration hits.  I just leave it in the family room where he plays and he calls me after the deed is done to clean up. Works out for both of us :)So overall, this is an excellent potty. The BabyBjorn products are usually on the expensive side, but are well worth the extra couple of dollars. The higher price accounts for exceptional design, which other companies tend to forego.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"That's not true for all potty seats (some seem better designed for girls than boys), but since we have B/G twins and ideally wanted matching seats, we researched exhaustively. The Baby Bjorn Potty Chair was an excellent purchase and made potty training relatively easy.It's also attractive, comfortable, and cleans easily. 5 stars.We had red and blue but there are more color choices now, and note also that certain colors go on sale from time to time.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This is the second potty seat that I bought for my daughter. She loves this seat. The first potty seat was one that could turn into a stepstool. You could remove the top to put on the toilet if you wanted. Well, we thought that was great, until we realized the top and bottom were constantly separating. It was making us crazy and annoyed. It was also awful to clean.Being a big fan of other Bjorn items, I decided to buy the (what I thought was overpriced) potty. Well, I wish I had just bought this in the first place. It's a cinch to clean! Just so easy to pop in the shower if there is an awful mess to clean.It has no whistles or bells. Instead of a sticker chart, I told my daughter I'd give her money everytime she used the potty. She was excited to ""feed her piggy"" pennies.My daughter (now 3) also sits on this chair when she is playing. Its that confortable. Also, small and portable enought to take with you when sleeping over someones house.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This has turned out to be a great little potty for our little boy.  He is tall for his age but still fits on here easily. Thankfully we have very few messes to clean up as the front shield does a great job of preventing any target practice around the bathroom.  It is also easy to clean, if still disgusting.  But really what potty chair isn't?  At this point I can't think of anything I would change about this potty chair.  Our son really likes the color and the fact that he can dump it out into the &#34;big potty&#34; and flush.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"For the most part, I really like this chair.  My son is an average size two-year-old, and he fits really well on it.  I also LOVE that the guard is permanent, rather than a flap that can fall off or be played with. Also, this chair is really easy for my son to get on and off of by himself, with the rubber lining on the bottom for holding the chair in place.The only thing I don't like is that if he sits on it for more than 30 seconds, it leaves a red ring around his bottom.  He'll sit on it through a whole book or two, but if he hasn't done his business by then, I'm usually out of luck because the potty starts hurting his bottom and he wants to get off.All in all, a great, simple product.  Not sure it's totally worth the amount of money I paid (kind of expensive), but my son likes it for short periods of time, so that's helpful in the potty training experience.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Does the job, no fancy bells or whistles- it's just a potty chair!  Still working on getting my daughter to actually use it for its intended purpose but so far she does enjoy sitting on it to watch tv.  I do like that the chair is not overly lare so it is easy to find space for it in smaller bathrooms.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,I purchased two big boy potty books that arrived a few days before this potty did.  We had a different potty that did not work well for boys at all.  Once this potty got here he has not had one accident!!!  He just turned two yesterday and he loves his potty!  He gets excited every time he goes and claps for himself proclaiming that he is a big boy!!!  I would highly recommend this potty!!!!  Don't keep searching buy this one!  I threw his other potty right in the garbage.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,This potty is just perfect for my daughter.  She loves sitting on it and is getting used to the idea of the potty.  It's not intimidating and is easy to clean.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,My two and half year old son loves the potty chair.  It's our second one and I'd recommend it to anyone.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We just bought this seat today and I am already soooo glad that I bought this one and not one of the other cheaper models I was looking at. The other models may have been cheaper but they were much more complicated, having three seperate parts to make keeping it clean quite a challenge.  The BabyBjorn has only two pieces and the whole thing is a nice, shiney clean looking white.  My daughter is comfortable when sitting on it and she gets on and off of it with no danger of tipping.  I am so pleased with this chair.  And if you are like I was and having a hard time spending $22.00 on a potty chair when there is another available for $12.99, give yourself some perspective:  how much are you spending on diapers EVERY WEEK???  I think this chair will be our family's ticket to waving goodbye to the diaper portion of the weekly grocery bill =)",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We have a small bathroom so I was a little worried how this would fit in there without getting in the way, but it fits great. My toddler loves to go & sit on it & at 18 months has already did 1 & 2 in it! It's a wonderful simple design that makes it super easy to clean. Love the green color, I think the picture displays the color accurately on my computer.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"The potty chair is great!  My 14 mo. old has not used it yet, but she does sit on it and explores--a great first step.The design is sleek and easy to use.  No sharp edges and easy to clean.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We tried another potty first, but we had a problem with pee not being kept in the bow because the lip at the front was not high enough.  So far no problems with this one.  Our son loves it.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,I purchase this BABYBJORN to replace another potty chair that I purchased first for my son.  This one has a great shape that accommodates little boys without having to worry about ""overshooting"" or ""spills"" as my son calls it.  He is very comfortable using this and I would purchase this product again in a heartbeat.  It is very easy to clean and doesn't have many nooks/crannies that would make cleaning difficult.  This potty chair has been a great training tool!,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Pros:  Sturdy but light to carry around (by my toddler), ease of placing and removing the white part, easy to clean. It also has rubber on the bottom so it doesn't slip. Last (but not least), the back support makes it comfortable for my toddler to sit there for long periods of time.Cons? Non really; perhaps they could offer more color options (there are about five )?",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I purchased this for our grandson who lives with us.  He used it very much during his potty training until he thought he was big enough to go on the big potty.  Very nice potty chair and I would recommend it to other parents. grandparens, etc.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,My daughter's short and most potty chairs are too tall and oddly shaped for her.This one is fabulous and she actually doesn't mind going to the potty.  The bowl is deep enough that even with a heavy stream or large load it doesn't overflow.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,Great little potty chair.  This is at grandmas house and unlike some others this one seems to be very comfortable for grandson to use.  It goes up in the front so pee doesn't splash all over it goes right in potty.  I would recommend this!,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This potty training chair is the best one I have used for my 2 yr old son.  He can easily get on and off of it, which is a problem with other chairs.  The ONLY thing I wish it had was a hole on the back of the chair to put your hand in to lift and move it.  Just grabbing the top of it to move where the potty is located is cumbersome.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"My son hasn't had any issues so far with potting training with this BabyBjorn. That was my main concern was finding a potty that was good for boys to train in. I would definitely recommend this one. My son just sits there, reads his book and potties. We are taking it slowly (not a 3 day training or anything) and he seems very comfortable with it.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I bought this potty mainly due to all the positive reviews. It's a good size, sleek, and simple. Unfortunately, my daughter became so excited to use it that she ran to the potty and sat down on the splash guard, which is hard plastic. We ended up at the doctor with a laceration, and weeks of screaming every time she needed to urinate. She's never used ANY potty ever again, and she's 2 1/2. This product is okay for very small children whose parents  can seat them. For older children that will seat themselves, choose one without a splash guard. They will splash regardless. A little pee on the floor is better than a traumatized child and stitches. Trust me.",1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I bought two of these potties on the recommendadtion of a friend.  They are neutral in color and look like our adult ""potties"" which our daughter loves.  Easy to clean, removable section makes it simple to empty and wash.  We're very happy with our choice.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I'm surprised this potty got such rave reviews. My daughter is so uncomfortable with this potty trainer! She'll sit on it, but it's so small. The splash guard is what really seems to make it uncomfortable for her. She's accidental sat on it before and it hurt her. When she sits on it the splash guard makes her have to sit with her legs open, but as I mentioned the seat is pretty narrow so she can't really sit on it comfortably.",1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This chair works extremely well and is worth every penny. It is extremely easy to clean, and comfortable for a toddler to use. I would strongly recommend this potty chair to every parent.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"After trying a potty chair that always ended up with a mess due to an inadequate splash guard for boys, I did my research and purchased this one. He has no trouble using this one and I have no messes to clean off the floor or walls!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I like the size and shape, it works well for my 18 month old that is slightly taller than average. It's sturdy and what I like best is that it only contains 2 parts. I just wish they had two versions because my little girl doesn't need a splash guard and it does get in the way. But not so much that I would say its a negative.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I got this potty chair because of all the good reviews, but I'm really disappointed. First the good things are that it does have a high back and is simple which makes it easy to clean, but my son does not find it comfortable at all! The first couple of times he sat on it, he had big red rings on his bottom and when he sat up the bucket stuck to his bottom and when it fell off it scared him because of the noise when it fell back into the potty. I thought it was because he was sitting so long but even sitting only a couple minutes it was the same thing. He is not a big boy either, he is actually on the smaller end. Now I am trying a potty with a soft seat and is attached to the potty. I don't write many reviews but hope this review helps others.",2
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We have actually purchased two of these potty chairs because we were so pleased with the product.  Our son seems to actually enjoy going to use the potty when we started training him.  Early on, it was very difficult and we tried using a step stool and one of the seats that fits on the toilet but that didn't work well.  After purchasing this, things started going much smoother.  Overall, a great product and I would highly recommend it to parents trying to potty train their kids.  And it is easy cleanup as well.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,This is a solid piece and holds up well. We are in the throes of potty training and have had success with this product. Nothing seeps out...,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I really like this potty chair - the high back keeps kids from falling off the back, and the raised front is great for little boys. We had another chair but only the Bjorn seemed to be high enough to prevent a mess for our boys. I also have the shorter backed version, and they are both good for different reasons. This one feels a little sturdier, and the bucket is easy to empty. The non-skid on the bottom keeps it from sliding all around the floor.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I like that it doesn't have a lid because my son would just play with the lid, but this also makes it too easy for my toddler to take this apart. If he ever went in the seat, he would end up spilling the contents. We never had that issue though because I couldn't get him to sit on this. He preferred a small seat put on the big potty.",3
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Bought it for my 9 month old baby girl, she can sit resting her feet on the ground and her back and arms are well comfortable too. This potty will grow with her.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"My son hasn't used it yet, but I'm sure it will be great when he does.  It had a lot of good reviews.  The only downside I see so far is that he always wants to lift the tray out and play with it.  I'm hoping he won't do that when there is ""stuff"" in there.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this potty. . .I found one in a garage sale, and had to go out and buy two more for upstairs, and my parents house.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"While this chair works fine, it's just not comfortable.  My son's little bottom is so red after just sitting on it for a short time!  He ends up either standing for some relief or moving around the chair in an attempt to find a comfortable position.  If I had to do it over again, I would buy something with a cushy seat.  Wouldn't buy this one again...",2
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"My son is a very tall three years old.  We have been trying to get him to use the toilet for the past few months and we were meet with nothing but resistance.  I bought this chair because it was taller than most, it looked comfortable to sit on and most importantly, it would be easy to clean.  When the chair arrived he was excited that it was HIS chair and sat on it for a few minutes.  The very next morning he asked if he could sit on his potty chair.  So we did.  Nothing, but he was obviously enamored with it. (I had promised him that he could decorate it with stickers) He insisted that we take it to my mom's house and later that day, unprompted, he peed in the potty.  We were so excited! Now imagine how it was later that evening when he actually pooped in the potty, again unprompted.Now I do think that my son may have been afraid of our very tall toilets and didn't like the fact that he had to have help getting on and off. Little Mr. Independence is now doing it all by himself.  Yes! THIS is THE chair you need to get!  I am one happy, happy mommy!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,I used this product to potty train two boys. It was comfortable for the boys and durable. The product was also easy to clean.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I bought multiple little potty chairs, but this is the only one my son felt comfortable enough sitting in long enough to accomplish anything. I definitely recommend this seat to parents of little ones.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We received this item last week in the mail and I have to say that I am very satisfied with the quality.  This is a very sturdy chair with a nice no-slip rubber coating around the bottom edges, and this seems like a chair that will be super easy to clean.  My daughter is not quite ready for this but I am sure this is a great purchase.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This is the only potty chair you will ever want or need!  My two children (ages 3 and 2) loved their chairs and were potty trained in no time using the Baby Bjorn potty chairs.  I previously purchased one that played songs when they went potty, but I quickly found it was very difficult to clean and to move around the house (too many parts). I loved the fact that is was so very easy to clean - no cracks or grooves or lids to worry about!  And I loved the portability of the chair.  It is lightweight and easy to move around the house (I would use it in the children's playroom when they could not make it to the bathroom). The Baby Bjorn could easily be used in your vehicle as well. Great simple design and very comfortable for the children to use as well.  Two thumbs up!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Love this potty chair!  After potty training with it, I purchased a second one for a second bathroom.  I have only potty trained girls and cannot attest if it works for boys as well.  It's smooth, easy to clean and easy to dump the pee and poop.  The whole potty doesn't get messy in the process.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Excelent, well built product. Very easy cleanup. Our daughter loves it and we would definitely recomend it to others (actualy we already did).",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I like it but like the Smart potty by BabyBjorn better. Its smaller and more easily stored away. Other than that this one is easy to use as well, inside comes out and outside easy to clean as well. it's just so big and my son seems to prefer the smart potty as well.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,My son was showing interest in going to the potty.  We bought a toilet seat that had a smaller seat inside the lid.  He was not too thrilled.  So we bought this chair and he instantly loved it.  He talks to the bear whenever he goes and we have been accident free for 2 weeks.  He is even coming around to the big potty!  Love this chair!!,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,The cup area just does not work good for little boys.  Needs a larger cup area to prevent urine from going straight out of potty chair .,3
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,I am so pleased with this potty. It is very comfortable for my 2 1/2 year old. It is also very easy to keep cleaned up.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"After extensive research, I finally settled on this potty chair and I am extremely pleased with my purchase.  I, like many other reviewers, was intially put off by the $22 price tag.The problem I have with many baby products today is that companies try to make something a ""new concept"" by adding bells and whistles or attempting to make things multi-purpose.  Don't get me wrong, I love technology and my daughter has tons of electronic gadgets, but potty chairs should not double as toys.  Nor do I care to have my child using her potty in the future to stand on to reach the sink.This is exactly what a potty should be... a potty and nothing else.  Its ergonomic design and rubber bottom makes it comfortable and stable, even on carpet.  It looks remarkably similar to a real potty because if its smooth, white finish.  When I got it home my 16-month-old daughter immediately knew what it was and wanted to sit on it.  She now loves to sit on the potty and this one appears to be very comfortable for her.In a nutshell, it is simply made, easy to clean and perfect for potty training.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I bought this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  I was pretty disappointed over all.  My daughter is tall for her age but not particularly chunky or chubby.  In any case, every time she stood up from this potty chair she also brought a red mark from the circular opening on her bum. I thought it was a little narrow for her.  Sometimes when she stood up, the white part actually came up with her. I personally did not think this was a great potty chair.  I think this might be because I have a girl and not a boy, since there seems to be issue with other potty's splash guards.  In my case, my daughter did not find this seat comfortable and did not take to it at all.  I later bought her that Fisher Price one with the face and that sings. It's a little lower, but wider and the seat cannot come up with her. She loves the songs, though it's lower and it is actually wider, so even though she is tall, no problems. Again, don't have a boy so can't speak to the splash guard issue, but really this potty is nothing out of this world for me.  It's collecting dust in my hallway closet right now.",2
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,We were able to potty train our LO before she turned 1. She is able to use this on her own now.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We were given this potty (in blue) by a neighbor, and my son has had some great early success on it. It's comfy, and the fact that the splash guard is a unibody construction with the removable pot is a godsend, in terms of how easy it is for my son to get on and off the chair. Within days of his first success, he was able to use this potty with no help and carry the pot in to me in the next room to show off his latest success! However, we didn't find out how truly great it was until we tried to buy a second potty for upstairs use. We've purchased two others. One had a splash guard so low and poorly designed that my son's ""privates"" landed squarely on top of it every time he sat down. Another had a high splash guard, but it was soft and movable and flopped down underneath my son every time he sat down. He's become very upset each time we try a new terrible potty and I feel awful for putting him through it. No more. We're buying a 2nd Baby Bjorn right now and I'd highly recommend that anyone about to embark on the potty training journey with a boy do the same. Simply the most well-designed potty chair out there.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,This potty chair went through two little boys and is now off to another for 'training'! Very sturdy and durable. I ordered late and was afraid I might not get it in time for a gift. Came just in time! I love being able to track my orders.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I bought this potty chair and the coordinating potty seat for my 2 year old son on the recommendation I read that the splash guard really worked.  And I'm frustrated to madness that the splash guard really DOESN'T work for him unless he sits on it just right (a little to the right and leaning forward). So he can't sit in the seat comfortably and not make a mess.On the up  side, it's easy to clean.  Still looking for a good slash guard.",3
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"The potty chair is easy to use, too low to the floor,  just not tall enough for my 2 1/2  year old grandson.",3
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Our son loves this potty.  It was delivered quickly, it washes easily, and it is simply wonderful.  Only positive things to say about this potty.  Highly recommend.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We've purchased three of these now, one for every room in the house. They work great for boys. We've tried a few other brands and this is the best, worth the money.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I was looking for a potty that was big enough for my son who was almost 4 years old and weighed about 35 pounds when he was ready to be potty trained. This potty worked great! He was able to get on and off the potty by himself. The potty compartment that holds the pee and poop comes right off, making clean up easy. The side of the potty raises up and my son holds onto it for additional support. The potty is very sturdy. Good construction.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I bought this potty chair based on reviews I read here on Amazon, and I'm very pleased with it and agree with what others have said: a higher shield that is good for boys, only 2 pieces so it's easier to clean, comfortable for the child to sit on, great grippers on bottom so it stays in place even if the child bumps into it while trying to sit down. Now if only the potty training itself were as easy as choosing this chair!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This product is so awsome I acually bought 3 of them for my daughter. One for home, and one for each grandparent's house. Adorable, practical, easy to use and clean. Also very durable if you have one of ""those kids."" Good price, ready for potty-training. You can't go wrong with this product.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Seems perfect.  My son is small but can sit down & stand up without any trouble.  He's hit the splashguard a couple of times, but it's rounded enough that he hasn't been hurt.  The rubber bottom is great too - the potty does not slide around at all.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We have on chair on loan in our classroom and almost all of the children want to use it so we ordered a second one to support this desire and to support potty learning.  It is well made and the children use it regularly.  It was a useful purchase, and we really like to beautiful green color.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,I gave this to a relative. They seemed happy with it. I guess I'll know more later. Hoping not to have to return this!,4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We have just started potty training my 33-month old son and he likes this potty chair very much. He loves it because his favorite color is red (his favorite car character is red), the cute bear(that what he said when he saw the potty chair first time) and comfortable to sit on it. I love the Babybjorn products and I love this potty chair too. No leaking,an integrated splash guard is working well and easy to grip the armrest when he stand up from the chair. And also the inner potty is easy to grip to remove and easy to clean. I'm very satisfied with this product. I would definitely recommend it!!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,Perfect fit for those tiny little legs and bodies.My grandson loves it and he fits comfortably on it.I was worried since he is a smaller two year old but its just perfect!,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We've had this for 7 months!Well designed...easy to clean, and easy on the tush.We just empty, rinse, and wipe with a lysol wipe to sanitize.My 3 yr old son has anxiety about big toilets, and still uses this even though he's been potty trained with NO accidents for 6 months. He'll use a ""big potty"" if there's nothing else, but he loves the independence of using this one...and frankly so do I.We're buying another one for my daughter and I'm actually excited about potty training!I read all the reviews, but I was still scared about buying this one, we had already tried 2 others, and this one is more expensive.IT'S ABSOLUTELY WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY!!!We plunked this sucker in front of the television, and sitting for the long wait for #2 wasn't torture for him.The front is nice and high...although we still had to teach him to hold his [...] down to avoid messes. Nothing is mess-proof during potty training, but this one DEFITELY cut down on the spills.We used stickers as rewards, and he put them on his potty.The container is big...the other products we tried had tiny containers.Okay, I know there are more awesome things about this potty, I just can't think of them right now.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,I got this potty for both my two year old and 9 month old girls.  I used the little BB potty for an older child and it worked great.  I love that their feet touch the floor when they use it.  It is easy to clean also.  This is a good potty to use at home for the beginner.  Highly recommend!,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This is a great potty!  No place for it to leak at, we had the Royal Potty but it leaked very badly.  But this one is great!  Plus it is cute!!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"""me love mine potty! mi mommy liks it also and got me too of dem!!! even dough mine fwends wowe undies,me didn't kare-me liked diapers but wen mommy getted me dis comfy potty,i never gonna go in mi diapers ever again.i luv it cuz i can do it bi miself like mi mommy and daddy!!!weneva i need to go i just go an sit down.it is so cozy dat me dozent mind sitting on it for while.sinc it is ony too peices,when im dunn i can just spill it in da toilet and wipe itwith potty wipes*and its all cleen for next time!""Mom's Commentary;This potty is really fantastic!I bought two of them-one for upstairs and one for downstairs.I especially like the white one because it gives a clean look.All the other pottys I've tried either had lots of grooves and peices that were hard to clean and deal with or were only one piece which we would have a whole ""operation clean-up"" after each use. As my child mentioned,she can spill it in the toilet and then clean it with CLOROX WIPES.(she calles them ""potty wipes""*) The rubber strip on the bottom makes it stay where its put.I also bought the  matching stool so that she can wash her hands and that stool proves to be great as well!I think that this potty deserves five stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Very sturdy, easy for child to use and removable section makes it easy to clean. Plus I love the pink colour!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I was completely against getting our son a potty chair just for the whole &#34;wash out/sanitization&#34; factor.  However, I'll admit that he is much more likely to use this potty than he is to use the toddler toilet ring we have that goes on our standard seat.  I think he is just more comfortable closer to the ground and likes being able to have his feet on the ground when waiting for the elusive number 2.  We've definitely had way more success with this chair than the toddler seat &#34;ring&#34; option!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"and hopefully our last!  Son liked it from the beginning.  Although we haven't had success on it yet, it is comfortable enough and roomy enough that he can sit on it for a while to get used to it.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"my daughter is 17 months old. I know it's early, but she sometimes will sit on her potty when mommy goes to the bathroom. however, if she sits on it without her diaper, it seems to be very uncomfortable for her. She squirms a lot and ends up leaning on the back of the potty so as to not have her butt on the seat. I'll have to update this review as she gets older.",2
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We've had this for 2 years now and its an excellent product. My son is 5 already and he still using it because its in his bedroom and he doesn't have to go all the way downstairs to pee if he doesn't want to since there is no bathroom upstairs. I love how I can just remove the insert and take it down with me on my way down, its small enough it can be rinsed out in the sink. So we use it long after he's potty trained its just a useful little thing, and portable if you need to take it on a trip or somewhere. My only regret is not buying it sooner. This would make an excellent gift for a baby shower!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,This potty chair is easy to clean and kids love to use it!  It is convenient and easy enough to take on the go.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I bought it for my 10-month old son who is extremely active. So when i got it, I was nit even sure I can seat him on the potty and keep him seated long enough. But the seat is so comfortable that he can sit in it and listen to a song for a minute or even two before he gets bored - that is usually enough to get him do his small business there. He even tries to play with it getting the white insert out and putting it back in like a puzzle though we try not to let him play with the potty much. Word of caution -  when I tried to seat him for the very first time, he tried to just walk out of it and went down head-first - he was not a strong walker back then but I was ready and caught him and put him right back so he did not get scared of the experience. We had to pick him up to standing until he was about 10.5 months old and became more confident standing and walking though. He can stand up carefully from it - no stumbles since then.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,This is an excellent potty chair. My grandson isnt afraid to sit on it at all. I think potty training with""his special chair"" will be a breeze...One can only hope!,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Very good material, nice and sturdy.  Smooth and rounded at all edges.  The design is simple enough to clean all the nooks and crannies and yet perfect for use.  Definitely deserves an award for design!  This potty is higher than a lot of the competitor's brands but it works for us because it's exactly what we needed for our daughter!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,My son loves this potty seat. He even dumps his pee in the toilet himself and then flushes. No more diapers at home at 18 month. Can't thank the manufacturer enough.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,this is a nicely made potty seat.  we have been using this since my little was 6 mo.  I am bummed at the expensive price but the simplicity and quality are worth it.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,Very basic potty. The potty lifts up and dumps into toilet nicely. Been using it for over a year now. Easy to clean. Just wipes down. Little girl using it and the little lip that rises in the front blocks any &#34;high streams&#34; if she is leaning back.  No messes so far. I like the white for use with any child and It has stayed white. Has a nice rubber like rim on the bottom that won't slide around on my wood floors. Light weight for when I am cleaning bathroom I just pick it up with one hand. May be a little small though for bigger kids with the way it wraps around. Not sure. Will try and update on that later. She has just turned 2 and is 30lbs and is not an issue.,4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,This was great for potty training and then great for teaching my son to go potty on his own.  I would recommend this chair.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"It's a wonderful potty, very comfortable, easy to clean... I love it. My only dislike is that I also bought the &#34;Summer Infant Lil' Loo Potty&#34; and it's almost identical, only half the price.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This was the second potty we bought for our son, who is almost 3.  In one word - horrible.  I had a lot of hope that, with all the excellent reviews, we'd find success with this one.  The basic issue is the splash guard, which really doesn't work at all.  Pee still goes everywhere.  I'd love to find one of the old-fashioned potties with the high cupped splash guard - but that's nearly impossible.  If I had known that this potty would be no better than others I've tried, I would have saved my money.",1
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Very happy! Its a must have if you have a boy! This potty is simple and sturdy, gets the job done!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"With some help and patience, my 14-month-old son does stay in this Babyjorn potty and does a really good job doing his business. It is so easy to clean. Just pour out, use soap and water to rinse, then whip down. Done!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"My daughter likes this chair. My only complaint is that her urine sometimes splashes out. We have taught her to lean forward and touch her toes to minimize the problem, which seems to help.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Comfortable, wildly easy to clean with no nooks or crannies, attractive in an adult designed bathroom. My daughter loves to use it and can sit on it for a very long time without being uncomfortable. We also bought the matching safe step stool and the set was very much worth the money. We get compliments all the time and I'm happy we didn't have to buy yet another chunk of pink plastic on our journey to potty training perfection.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"My son likes using it, the splashguard works perfectly... no complaints!  It is easy to clean and my son seems to like sitting on it.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I ordered two BABYBJORN potty chairs, one for our grandson and one as a gift for another baby.  After researching many designs on the web, this product seemed the best.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This is working just fine, no regrets, in fact I purchased two.  I originally bought one form my home and when my daughter saw it, she liked it better than the one she had purchased.  So ofcourse grammy bought her one too.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Simple design that is comfortable for my little guy and easy to clean ,its not cheap plastic and is very firm and there's rubber on the bottom so it won't glide around when your child gets on or off.overall a good product and I'm satisfied",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,I bought this chair as a second potty for my 1 1/2 year old daughter while I potty trained my son. I already owned a a white one for him.The great part of this potty is its simplicity. The high back is genius. The 2 piece design is perfect. My wife thought my son would like a ""car"" potty. It broke down into 4 pieces. My kids tore it apart playing with it.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I just finished potty training my oldest child and really loved this potty chair.  When we first started potty training, it was a little too big for her- so if you have a small child, it might be hard for him/her to easily get on and off of it alone.  By the time she was 2.5, she had no issues getting on and off.  The splash guard is great and makes it easy to lift out while still keeping your hands clean.  The potty part is also deep enough to hold anything in it if your child decides to bring you the potty to show you their work :)Great little potty!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I started potty training my son early (at 11 months).  Since I didn't have any other kids, I had no idea which chair to try.  I first bought the safety first chair and it leaked, tipped over, and the deflector pinched my son.  All of the chairs that I tried were too tall and my son couldn't touch the floor with his feet. Most of the chairs were just a plain seat, with no back or sides, and nothing to hold on to. WHat a nightmare!  I decided to go back to [the store] and try another chair.  While in the store I let my son sit (fully clothed) on the Baby Bjorn potty chair...he loved it so much!  He cried when I took him off of it!  It has a good deflector that is not able to pinch, it has a wide and deep bowl which makes cleaning a breeze, and it's design with a high back and sides make it comfy.  It is also low enough that my son can easily get on and off my himself.  I will definately use the Bjorn products for potty training from now on!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"My son is not actually anywhere close to understanding the concept of this, but my impression is that it is VERY simple to clean up (which I LOVE the idea of).  It seems comfy, he sits in it often and plays with it sometimes :)",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We have used many Potty seats. By far, this one is worth the buck! My daughter is now 3 and started using the potty at 2 years old. She showed an interest. We were so concerned about using Elmo and something fun and forgetting what ""practical"" meant and ""usable"" for a 2+ year old. I have Babybjorn upstairs and downstairs in our home. My daughter loves it. She is getting a bit older now for this potty as she has grown, so we are looking for a good step stool for our toilets. If you are looking for a potty, this is the ONE TO BUY. The pee does not get out of the potty, its easy to clean and the shape of it works great for when they sit.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,I love this potty seat. There is no foam seat for the pee to seep into. Just two simple pieces that are so easy to clean. This was the best thing I could have bought for all of our potty training kids. The lip in front looked too high at first. But actually it is perfect. Perfect for girls potty training and for little boys. I would recommend this seat to anyone who has a little one potty training. I just might keep this seat forever....I will have visiting grandchildren someday. :),5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Sadly, this product arrived warped and wouldn't sit stable on the floor. Had to box it back up (um, bulky) and send it back.Found it locally and purchased. Love the product itself now that it sits safely and securely. Easy clean up due to the lack of creased and only 2 smoothly molded parts. Would purchase again.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We got this for our 14 month old boy and he quickly got accustomed to using this. It is very easy to clean and is low enough to be very comfortable. He grew too tall for it within six months and we had to get him to the baby potty seat, which was another training curve. I liked the product.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We bought a different, 3-in-1 style potty initially and boy, was it a pain to keep clean. This made it (and the bathroom) stink to no end. It also had a removable pee-guard that our son loved to remove and drop in the toilet.I LOVE how simple this potty is. Two pieces, plus a built-in pee guard (which our 18 month old has had no issues with). We haven't had an issue with him peeing out of the potty. I think the high seat back makes him feel more secure while he's sitting there doing his business. It also has no-skid rubber on the bottom, so no more scooting around the bathroom.Buy this, you won't regret it!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,We have both the bjorn potty chair and the potty seat. Some days my 18-mo-old wants to have baby doll on the chair and herself on the toilet. I mainly bought this one so we'd have one for traveling. It is made of hard smooth plastic and the white bucket comes out. Close to the floor means she can get on and off by herself...that's a pro and a con.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,It has a simple design but great for the purpose of potty training. My son is using this chair and feels comfortable.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,Exactly what I was looking for. My 2yr old had no problem using it the same day we received it.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Thanks to Amazon's 90 day return policy, we bought 4 different potties for our boy to try. No, he didn't ""use"" them, just sat on them to test durability, comfort, and function.Durability - solid plastic. I'm not going to sit on it, but it handles a 32lb kid no problemComfort - No problem sitting on this potty. the raised back is very nice additionFunction - The most important aspect. The raised lip on the front is a MUST for boys. Other potties we tried the lip was not high enough (or not there), which could be a disaster. Raised back is also helpful for holding and guiding your kid down.Highly recommend this for potty training at home. We have the other brand/styles that have wipe holders, etc but don't use it. Avoid the ""talking"" potties and create your own reward system (M&M;'s work great or there are a ton of potty training apps for phones and tablets). You can also get one of the more basic, smaller potties to keep in your car for trips.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Our family is just starting EC (elimination communication) with our 5 month old son.  I take it back, we're coming back to it after a break due to some other events in the family that just made it too challenging.  While this potty isn't making the whole EC process any easier, it's certainly making it more pleasant for everyone involved.First off, this potty is wonderfully small, which makes it ideal for our purposes.  At the same time it's big enough that my 3 year old can sit on it and could quite likely use it, not that he does.  He prefers to use the toilet like a big boy, but I can see this potty being useful for long-term use in our family, and both for larger and smaller children.Our second favorite feature of this particular potty chair is the back.  We had looked at other potties without a back, but this one makes it ideal for our purposes.  Our little guy can sit on this potty chair on his own (closely supervised, of course).  Potty time is more enjoyable because he can lean back and won't topple over off the potty, which means our little one finds it so nice.  He much prefers it to using the toilet or another receptacle.  He particularly likes to sit on it while holding on to my knees, or to sit with his feet propped up on that rise in the front, putting him in a more classic EC squat without needing someone to hold him in that position.  This allows me the ability to sit in front of him easily to hold his hands while he sits, or as he seems to prefer, holding my knees while between my legs while I sit on the couch in front of him.I can imagine for EC purposes this may be challenging for potty time with a younger baby as the back could get in the way, but I think it could be managed to potty the baby while facing the back of the potty chair similar to the way you would sitting in front of a full sized toilet.  I can't comment on how it would work for a younger baby though as we got it when he was so much older.Overall, for both EC purposes and more traditional potty time, this potty chair is great.  It's pretty light, easy to transport, and easy to clean.  While it's not as small as other potty chairs that may be more convenient for on the go, it's easy to move from room to room as need be and could easily enough be put in the back of a car to be taken on the road.  We're probably going to look for a travel potty solution that may work better for traveling, but for the time being we can make this work.Since this potty is so small and incredibly stable (our 3 year old and 5 month old can both sit on it securely without knocking it over) I can see this potty being useful for not just the EC baby, but also for a smaller child learning to use the potty.  Small toddlers may find this ideal because it's such an easy, convenient size for self-directed use.  Both my boys love this potty.  For my family it was a great investment.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,I am so happy with this potty chair.  My daughter potty trained at 2 1/2 years old and we have been using this chair for about 8 months.  It is wonderful!  The high back is great for the times she needs to sit for a while.  She can relax in comfort.  One of the best features of this chair is the removable bowl.  It makes cleaning very easy.  The main reason why I purchased this chair is because I didn't want a character potty in out 1st floor bathroom that guests use.  We are very happy with this potty chair and would highly recommend this product.  It costs a little more than some of the other potty chairs on the market but I would say this chair is worth every penny!,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"So the BABYBJORN product is decent.  But the supplier and their unconscious workers who pack the BABYBJORN products require training in packing items.  Item arrived in a box too big...wrapped loosely in plastic...with ZERO packing to prevent it from rolling around inside the box.  What's happened to training employees? Management appears to be asleep at the wheel.  Why would ANY company hire people to do lousy work?  I wonder if these same employees would like to receive their video games wrapped loosely in toilet paper...thrown in a box 4 times bigger than their precious video game? I suppose it's all about perspective, isn't it?",2
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Our 2-year-old-son is being potty trained using one of these chairs in each of our bathrooms. He's very large for his age, around 40"" tall and 37lbs. He fits on the chairs with no problem, seems very comfortable on them, and they have been working great for us. They're very easy to clean, and the splash guard is useful, although it's not a substitute for gentle reminders to point the, erm, ""hose"" down when he's sitting down to pee. The grips on the bottom seem to work well on our tile/vinyl flooring. Definitely recommend.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I BOUGHT THIS POTTY AFTER READING MANY REVIEWS ONLINE.  WE HAD A FISHER PRICE POTTY THRONE WHERE IT PLAYS MUSIC AND LIGHTS UP, AND MY DAUGHTER DID NOT LIKE IT, IT WAS HARD FOR HER TO GET ON AND OFF AND THE MUSIC JUST PLAYS AND PLAYS!  THE BABY BJORN IS GREAT, I LOVE THE RUBBER ON THE BOTTOM, CAN'T BE PUSHED THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE, AND MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT.  SHE WILL SIT ON IT AND READ BOOK AFTER BOOK.  THE HIGH BACK IS GREAT TO SO SHE CAN LEAN BACK AND RELAX, VERY EASY TO CLEAN, NO CRACKS OR CREVICES. IT IS A GREAT SIZE AS WELL, WE GO CAMPING A LOT AND IT IS A PERFECT SIZE FOR OUR CAMPER  THIS POTTY WILL BE HERE FOR ALL OUR CHILDREN TOO COME",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This Potty chair, is a bit different from others on the market. While priced on the high scale, it seems much more comfortable for the kids, having a higher back support.Cleaning is very easy, and my kid loves it ...",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This worked great, my kids love it they are comfortable on it and its stable.  Very easy to clean and we've never had anything end up outside the bucket!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,its a good potty seat.Could have been much better with a lid that is why 4 stars..other than that great item,4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I bought this for my girl since it had to be pink. I bought a few potty training stories that feature a pink potty just like this one, so it was great to find it and have her connect stories to the actual thing. Using it, as a mom, was a breeze. Light and easy to use, easy to clean and disinfect, easy to move around, comfortable for her and PINK! Did I mention it was pink? It made potty training a success story for us!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"My son is only beginning to potty train, but he instantly felt comfortable with this seat.  I had purchased a construction truck potty for him because he likes that sort of thing, and he thought it was neat, but he hated to sit on that potty.  I failed to realize how important comfort and feeling secure are in the potty training process.  He was successful the first time he sat on this potty and tried to pee!  Great product!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This is the best Potty Chair I have ever had. I have gone through many potty chairs in my child care home and this is the best. This is great for little boys and girls of all sizes, even the chunkier hineys! Cleans easy too! :)",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,Our little grandson uses this and it's the perfect size.  Love how it's designed so no potty gets on the floor.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,We put this in the back of the van for when the kids can't hold it. The better ones to use in the house attach to the toilet then you don't have to clean this thing out every time your child uses the bathroom.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"As a ""first time"" mom of a 13 month old boy, these reviews have been so helpful! Not only do I know which potty seat works best for other little guys...but I also know the ones to run away from! Thank you Moms!!!!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I bought this chair for my almost-14-month-old son to get him used to seeing it and sitting on it.  I usually put him on it with his clothes on and he thinks it's funny to stand up and sit down over and over again.  I've put him on it a couple times without his diaper and most times he actually uses it!  I think it's more likely due to lucky timing, but I'm still so proud!  I'm not pushing the potty-training idea yet since he's not quite 15 months yet, but so far he seems happy about the chair.  I am a little worried about him outgrowing it before he is fully potty trained, but I'll probably just get him the BabyBjorn attachment to a regular toilet if that happens.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We used a few other potty seats before getting two of these for our son- one upstairs and one downstairs.  It is easy to clean, and I love the splashguard when he is sitting down.  We used it for several months and I would have given it 5 stars... until he started peeing standing up. When he hits the back of the toilet instead of the bowl, urine leaks and pools under the potty. TMI- he is still working on aim, so nearly every time I have to wipe down the whole thing plus the floor. We've started putting a hand towel underneath the potty at all times because we were using a huge amount of wipes to absorb the pooling. The advantage of this model is the ease of cleaning, but it is a hassle to have to clean the floor too every single time too.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,This is a much needed tool for potty training! The only thing we would change is the ""potty guard"". It should be higher so that it covers the private parts on little boys. Sometimes we end up with a mess.,4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"The moment my daughter saw it, she started to use it. It catches her attention right away. The potty is sturdy and comfortable for young kid.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We have two other potties (hand me downs, etc) and this one is far superior.  My son prefers this throne to the others and that says it all.  Easy to clean, no silly lid that falls down, breaks etc. and very comfortable.  Get one for your little pooper.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"My son is using this potty chair for two months already. He love it! The sit is comfortable and provides support. Depends how big is your child, she or he may need some support if they are not able to sit alone. It is easy to clean. This product has good quality.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This works better then any chair I tried for my 18 month old son (3 total).  The seat is long enought to fit his butt, and the cup is tall enough to stop the mess, the back keeps him from falling off the back, the rubber keeps the whole thing in place, simple clean up.  However, I wish it also closed to a stool, my daughters did and she is 6 now.  We still use it as a stool in the bathroom.  It just seems that it would be nice if it grew with the kid.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,It's great. My little boy wants to go potty and he can do most by himself. Great for an accidental purchase.,4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This is my daughter's first potty and she peed into it the very first time she sat on it!  It is easy to clean and fits well in a small bathroom, very user friendly!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,The potty chair works great and is not messy to clean. My son loves it too! I will definitely recommend it.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I was very satisfied with the quality of this potty chair.  However, my daughter used it as a piano bench for her toy piano and nothing else.  Then one day I took her to a family restroom that had a little potty in it and she ran for it to go sit down.  I immediately bought her a potty chair that looked more like a real toilet and found that she actually was interested in potty training, she just didn't realize this chair was supposed to be a potty.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,My 20 month old baby loves his new potty. I think he was more excited than I was when he first saw his green potty. Easy to clean.,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,Works perfect and is the best size that I have tried so far. Easy for the child to get in and out of!,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"Don't think or look any more, just buy this one.  So easy to use, my son took to it right way.  That's after he had a not so pleasant experience with 2 others we tried first. This potty is lightweight my son can carry it from one room to another; super easy to clean no crevices to trap urine; and nicely designed.  No need for all the bells and whistles, they were distracting to my son too. He's been using it for about 6 months, now I just have to figure out how to transition him to the big potty.  BABYBjorn also makes a potty for that, which I will be buying too. Perfect!",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I bought this for my 6 month girl, she was actually scared when I seat her in at the first time, and tended to lean forward so I have to support her, but she did pee&poo in it. And after one or two uses she totally got used to it and loves being on it.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,I bought this for my son when he was four months old. Yes! And he is number 2 potty trained!,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This was our second potty for my daughter as the first one was too difficult for her to sit on. We got it before 18 months and she is very small for her age, the other potty we had was &#34;the shortest on the market&#34; but bc of the design she had trouble. She had loved this potty since day 1 and she likes the little bear logo on the front. The only downfall ivories would be she can grab the basin and easily pull it out but she is pretty good about letting me do it. Like the gray color too.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"this potty came highly recommended and its pretty well made FOR GIRLS. however my son never sites for peepee, the pee goes between the removable part and the chair and ends up on the floor under the chair! when he sits down to make #2 his pee goes all over the place since the peepee ""high"" part is not high enough. if you have a girl this should not be a problem but if your boy is just starting to to go to the potty and you dont know if he will be standing or sitting, I WOULD NOT GO WITH THIS POTTY!!!!",2
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We are just now introducing the potty to my toddler; therefore, have yet to use it in its full capacity. He appears to fit great on it and it looks as it it will be easy to clean.",4
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,"I received these as a gift along with lots of other more traditional burp cloths and the cloth diapers with thicker centers. I inadvertently returned the ones with the thicker centers by mistake. I must say it was the best mistake I've ever made. My son is 8 months old and we use these every single day. Drooly chin, spit up, peek-a-boo, you name it. We carry them everywhere and he loves to cuddle with them. It is so much better than a lovey because we can replace and wash all we want and he always has another. I use dressier, nicer burp cloths just for looks at church and things, but this cloth is our #1 buddy wherever we go.",5
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,this looks like a gauze or cheesecloth! you can see thru it. these are not made with birdseye - check out my photo to see the difference.,1
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,"I used these as cloth diapers with my second child for the first two months. They work well, especially with a liner, when the baby is eating and being changed every 2-4 hours. Even on a 6-lb newborn, they're not bulky. When the baby starts to sleep longer than 4 hours, though, a more absorbent diaper becomes necessary. Right now, I'm double-layering mine until my bamboo terry squares are delivered. As a cheap, readily available newborn cloth diaper, these are great. You do have to know how to fold a flat diaper, though. I suspect that may be the issue with the reviewer who said these don't work as well as the prefolds. A flatfold offers more versatility and can be a much better diaper if you know how to use it.The low price of this product, coupled with its several other uses, more than make up for its short life as a diaper. We've used ours as burp cloths, cleaning/dust rags, (very) informal cloth napkins, paper towel substitutes, etc. Don't be dismayed when you first take them out of the package! They seem thin and useless, but a quick run through the laundry fluffs them right up.",4
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,"I bought these with the sole intent of using them as burp cloths, since many other reviews have suggested this use. When I opened the package I was shocked at how thin the material is. I can actually see clearly through them! They also don't retain their shape at all after one washing.I wasn't upset at first because I knew I was not planning on using them as diapers. However, I folded the ""diaper"" in half to use as a burp cloth and the spit up leaked right through! Are you kidding me?I am irritated enough to have wasted money on not-so-great burp cloths... but I think it is terrible that Gerber uses the word diaper on the label. There is NO WAY these could be used as a diaper! The material is like cheesecloth!",1
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,"When I received these at my baby shower, I thought &quot;What is this?...slightly cheap seeming diapers?&quot;  When I brought Baby home I soon saw how practical they are.  Thin, yes!  But simply fold them in half and it will take point-blank projectile vomits without any problem.  We use them ALL the time, lifesavers really.  Great for wiping drooly little chins and messy little hands.  I give them now as shower gifts....the workhorse of the nursery.  I am using my first set with baby #2.",5
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,"I bought these for use as burp cloths with my first three children, the last in 2007.  They were fantastic.  After the boys outgrew the need for burp cloths, they still liked to sleep with them, they were so soft.I recently bought another package in anticipation of our 4th baby, and I could not be more disappointed.  They are 2/3 the size of the originals.  The edges are serged - and not very carefully - instead of finished.  The fabric is rough, even after washing.  I have searched for a better alternative with no luck.I don't know what caused Gerber to alter the quality of their product, but I am one very disappointed customer.  I will not be recommending them to anyone.",1
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,My husband uses these as sweat rags and I use them as dust rags.  They last forever.  Aren't as big as the last ones I got but this size works fine for us.  Wash them with some fabric softener and they fluff up nicely.,4
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,"These for cloth diapering?  Um, no way.  Way too thin for that.  These for burp cloths?  Absolutely!  While I still periodically reach for the pretty and colorful burp cloths that are specifically made for that use, they are not nearly as absorbent as these Gerber cloth diapers.  My child is not even all that prone to throwing up and the other burp cloths are still not enough... I cannot imagine how often you would have to reach for a 2nd, 3rd and 4th burp cloth if you had a baby who spit up all the time.  These are easily washed and inexpensive... admittedly not as pretty, but most mothers get over ""pretty"" real quick when real life sets in and baby becomes messy all of the time! lol",5
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,"Love these! Absorbent, soft, inexpensive, held up well after many MANY washes, no stains, ect.  My only complaint is that they shrink quite a bit.My daughter has always hated wearing disposable diapers.  When she was a newborn, she'd holler whenever we tried to put one on her.  As she got older, she'd arch her back, scream, and try to get away as we were putting the diaper on her.  So when she was a newborn, I used these flat folds wrapped oragami style (no plastic cover, although you could use one) to give her a break from her disposable diaper.  We've actually made the switch to cloth diapering full time.  Now I use these as a cloth insert for the gdiaper (fold in fourths, then half) and Thirsties (fold in thirds, then half).  You could also easily use these to stuff pocket diapers.",4
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,"I've tried several types of cloth diapers and these flats with a Thirsties Duo wrap cover are my favorite.  I fold them in an ""Origami fold"" (there are videos on youtube) and they fit my son perfectly.  It was actually a happy accident that I received these: I had registered for prefolds and my cousin bought me a package of flats by mistake.  Since the prefolds were much too large for my 7lb 12oz baby, I decided to try these and they fit great!  Much less bulky.  Now at almost 5 months old we are still using them.  At night my son is wetting more these days so I use an additional doubler (a gDiaper cotton insert) which works great, or I could use 2 diapers.  I prefer these to other options b/c they wash clean and dry quickly whether in the dryer or hanging out on the washline.  They don't get stained too bad and any stains that do occur either wash out in the 2nd wash or are removed completely by drying them in the sun.  Plus these are the most economical cloth diapering option.  Some of the negative comments are from folks who don't understand/appreciate flats or birdseye fabric.  The fabric starts out as a large, thin piece of fabric.  After you wash them they shrink down to the usable size and become puckered.  That's what is supposed to happen - it's the nature of this type of fabric.",5
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,"I bought these diapers to use as dish towels since I had been using old birdseye diapers this way for many years because they are soft, smooth and very absorbent. They also tolerate being bleached every week. These that I got from Gerber were horrible quality fabric, rough, uneven, thin and the machine hems are uneven and ugly. These are no better than cheese cloth rags. I wish I knew where to get the real thing.",1
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,"These are fine for what I bought them for, burp clothes, etc. But I can't imagine anyone being able to use these as actual diapers. They feel as thin as cheese cloth. They also got even flimsier after the first wash.",2
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,"I disagree with whoever said that these are too thin for burp cloths.  They do look gauzy, but fold them over once, and they're thick enough to absorb most of my baby's spit-ups entirely, and (apologies if this gets graphic) even a single layer is effective at catching all the chunky bits in spit-up which can cause your clothes to smell.  I fear that the prefolds would be too bulky for me and not nearly broad enough.  I like the simple, large form of these diapers.I use these predominantly as burp clothes.  They are so absorbent, so effective, so economical, and so handy.  I have three packs, and I really needed them all when my baby was a newborn.  I keep a tall stack on my coffee table, and I'm always ready for errant bodily fluids.I also occasionally use these to wipe up all manner of spills.  They're extremely effective at drying dishes and wiping down counter tops.  In a pinch, they make great handkerchiefs for my runny nose when I'm out for a walk with the stroller.  I also fold them and put them in my baby's (all-in-one-cloth) diaper if I want to give it a bit more absorbing power.  Tuck one in the car-seat, another in your pocket, and lay one under your baby's head when she goes down for a nap.  They don't take up much room in the laundry, so you might as well use them liberally and keep the rest of your life clean and dry!",5
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,I have 2 dozen of these that I was going to use as ""back up"" diapers for my cloth stash. After one wash and dry they were too small to use. Not worth a penny in terms of diapers but great burp cloths and dust rags.,2
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,These diapers are too thin (gauzy). I purchased them to use them as burp clothes and they work fine for that function.,3
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,"Bought these on sale at Babies RUS. Well, now I know why they are so frequently on sale. The cloth is too thin and flimsy to use as diapers or burp cloths, and even worse, the material sheds little fibers constantly into the air. I had to wash an entire load of laundry again because all the fibers from these diapers got onto them,. They shed even after they are washed and dried.Terrible quality!",1
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,"Buying diapers again after 27 years, as a grandmother, I was disappointed. I expected a soft cloth. These are not what I was expecting. I recall the large single ply diapers that were excellent for everythin and also the prefilded ones that were as soft as a cloud.  These are rather flimsy but I guess for a lap pad they will work.",2
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,"These diapers are PERFECT as burp cloths and mini-towels.  We used them as burp cloths when our daughter was an infant, and we continue to use them to wipe messy faces after meals, as well as to wipe runny noses during teething.  We keep them all over the house!  Be careful though - there are two types, one with padding and one without - make sure to get the ones without, as the ones with extra padding are useless in this capacity.  (They make great car shammies, though!)",5
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,"Guess what, I used this product as burp cloth rather than cloth diapers because the burp clothes were too expensive.  It works well as a burp cloth and it's a lot cheaper than a burp cloth so I would recommend that persons purchase this item.",3
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,"These looked huge when I took them out of the package! Don't worry they will shrink down a little after the first wash. These are absorbent and great for burp cloths because you don't have to worry about staining them. They are very easy to wash and could potentially be bleached. After the first wash, they might not be as soft was you would wish but after a few washes this is not an issue. In short, I love them. I have 2 packages of them and I use them every day. I have cute ones that I might use outside of the house, but these are definitely my first choice.My auntie recommended them to me and I am very thankful for that! She used them with her kids and they are now a necessity in my house.",5
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,"I ordered these with the expectation that the fabric would be a quality, tight birdseye weave.  They are instead a flimsy gauze with poorly finished edges.  I washed them three times and they are still not soft as I would expect.  Gerber should be ashamed.",1
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,"First, let me state, I have never actually used these as diapers.  EVERYONE gets these for baby shower gifts, and they all look at me funny, until I explain why.  These are the best ""spit rags"" ever created.  Perfect for using as burp cloths, as they are large, and can be washed in hot water and bleached (though it's always best not to use bleach on baby stuff, these aren't actually put ON the baby).  Products sold as ""burp cloths"" are generally very small....I think they were created by people who have never actually been spit up on.  These flatfold diapers are very large....I fold them in half or tri-fold them long ways, and throw it over my shoulder.  It's long enough to cover the front and back of my shirt.  They are also good for a makeshift bib once the baby is old enough to eat baby foods.  Simply tuck into the collar of the shirt.  They make a good makeshift 'prop' for the head, if you roll it up (you know the ""U"" shaped cushions they make for helping baby keep their head straight).  Of course you would never want to use them like that and leave baby unsupervised.If you need to lay the baby on a couch/chair to change a diaper, in a pinch, these can work as a changing mat too.Once the baby is older, and is done using them, they are fantastic cleaning cloths....great for glass, countertops, etc.  They're good for keeping in the car to wipe up any spills, etc.  There's a bunch of uses for these things!",5
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,"Yep, flat diapers are indispensible for baby.  But skip the Gerbers!I'd decided to cloth diaper, and got some fantastic (big, thick, soft) birdseye flats for $12 per dozen, online (Google flat diapers).At the shower I was given some of these, and I thought ""cool, some cheapies for the non-diapering situations.""I was shocked to find they're not that cheap, and even more shocked at the (lack of) quality.  After 5 weeks, these are still sitting untouched on the shelf, even though my tendency to grab my ""diapering diapers"" for everything has me running short on diapers a lot!",1
Playtex Sipster Cup 9 oz - 2 Pack (Colors Vary),"These are great to prevent toddler spills.  We previously were using a different brand that had a soft spout sippy and our two year old managed to chew them to pieces, which of course meant that they leaked everywhere.  Because these are hard spout, he is unable to do this.  I still had two in my cupboard from years ago (1997 to be exact) that worked wonderfully, prompting me to see if I could find some more.",5
Playtex Sipster Cup 9 oz - 2 Pack (Colors Vary),So glad I can still find the old cups that don't leak (unlike the new ones!),5
Playtex Sipster Cup 9 oz - 2 Pack (Colors Vary),did not receive the blue and green colored cups for my little boys as pictured. i received pink and orange ones that said &#34;sugar and spice and everything nice....&#34; ugh,1
Playtex Sipster Cup 9 oz - 2 Pack (Colors Vary),I really like these cups. They clean well and they don't leak.  She like to walk with it sometimes but I don't have to worry about the mess.  She likes the design too.,5
Playtex Sipster Cup 9 oz - 2 Pack (Colors Vary),"I have had such a hard time finding sippy cups that don't leak. Forget the soft-topped silicone mouth-piece ones. My son just turns those upside down and squishes them onto any surface he can find, thus soaking said surface with his milk, juice or water. These cups feature a hard top that will not squish and are easy for my son to drink from. I have bought about 3 or 4 packs of these so we don't run out of clean ones in the event I don't have to do dishes every day.The simple design of these cups seems to be the best design for a sippy cup. I have never had a problem with these cups leaking - and they take a lot of abuse from my toddler. He likes to scrape his teeth on the mouthpiece and that part of each cup is showing some wear, but I figure that's going to happen regardless, so I didn't take away any stars for that.",5
Playtex Sipster Cup 9 oz - 2 Pack (Colors Vary),"My son starts to use this cup at 13 months. He couldn't handle the rigid spout at the first several times, but once he learns how to, he finishes up all his formula in it with no any leftover. The cup is also very easy to clean.",5
Playtex Sipster Cup 9 oz - 2 Pack (Colors Vary),"My child at a year old can sip out of them but a lot does come out.  He is getting better now after a few months of having them.  He throws this on our hard floors and nothing comes out!  It's a great cup that way, totally spillproof!  Playtex does make insulated ones which in my opinion are a lot better for two reasons.The first reason is that my childs hands do not get cold while sipping from cup and second the drink stays a lot colder a lot longer.  The valves are easy to put in and take out, my child only has water and milk still so I am not sure how well they will work for juice.",4
Playtex Sipster Cup 9 oz - 2 Pack (Colors Vary),"does not leak,relatively easy to clean,nothing to chew trough (it is amazing that a replacement part for a soft spout may cost as much as a new sippy)and yes, the bottle is finally gone!",5
Playtex Sipster Cup 9 oz - 2 Pack (Colors Vary),My kids LOVE these cups! And frankly so do I :) They have a very easy to use valve that allows kids to easily drink. They are easy to clean and perfect for travel. May not be for a beginning cup user. My daughter preferred a soft spout when she started using a cup and these are hard plastic.,5
Playtex Sipster Cup 9 oz - 2 Pack (Colors Vary),"Our son has a bad habit of wanting to cuddle with a cup in bed. Once he was weaned off the bottle, we had to find a cup that we could put water into so that he could drink out of it at night with no dental worries, but that didn't leave his clothes and bedding all wet. The Playtex cups have really been a hit. I would say that they aren't as completely shake-proof as the Gerber Graduates, but they are definitely tip-proof and don't leak even rolling around a bed all night. I would say 99.98%. Plus, my little man seems to like these a lot more than the rest. They are a nice slim, easy to hold design, with nice kinda sparkly colors. You can replace the valves if they get old. They are easy to clean. We use the  Gerber Graduates for play time cups (no problem leaking when bounced, dropped, etc.) and the Playtex Sipsters for night time, bed time, dinner time, etc. We've tossed out or donated everything else.",5
Playtex Sipster Cup 9 oz - 2 Pack (Colors Vary),"I have a 3 1/2 year old and a 1 1/2 year old and have had my fare share of sippy cups to use clean sometimes throw many away. I use to think that using the soft sippy cups  was a great transition from bottles..NOT!! these are the best they are easy to clean they dont leak everywhere and they hold the perfect amount of liquid. I have found that children with teeth chew on the soft tip and it is no longer leek proof which makes night time a big pain, anyways these are awsome and i defiantly recommend them. I got the purple and pink one since they very but i didnt mind its not like having a pink sippy cup makes my son gay or anything so people are so silly",5
Sassy Baby Food Pantry Organizer,"I would recommend this.  In fact, I am about to order a second of these.  It helps sort the jars and lets you know what you are about to run out of.  I am ordering a second now that our baby is eating more different types.  (I am planning on having one for fruits and juices and one for vegetables.) It does not feel solid when you take it out of the box but once you snap it together (which is a cinch) it works well and is appropriately sturdy.",4
Sassy Baby Food Pantry Organizer,"This organizer is alright for the family that uses jarred baby food.  I always had three times as many jars as it would hold.Not a lot of baby food comes in jars these days.  It is so much cheaper and easier to make your own baby food, or just feed the baby what you are eating as soon as they have the proper grasp.I used this product for a month or so before I wised up.",2
Sassy Baby Food Pantry Organizer,"I've been using this for my daughter for the last few months and the holder is not as good as you would think. It's pretty hard to set up, rather plastic, and after a while of sitting in one place, it sticks to the surface and is very hard to move unless you take everything off it and rip it off the surface it's on! Would not buy again",2
Sassy Baby Food Pantry Organizer,I actually purchased this to store small cans of Fancy Feast cat food for my three cats. I am sure it works nice for baby food but the cans of Fancy feast are just a little to large in diameter to fit properly. The shelf is not overly sturdy but would be adequate for baby food. This is of no help I am sure.,3
Sassy Baby Food Pantry Organizer,"Loved this organizer! Takes up a small footprint on the counter and I was able to keep all my daughters food sorted and organized. As she got older and had more of a selection, I P-touched the rows to state breakfast, lunch, dinner, fruits, and veggies. It was helpful when I had someone else watching her as they would know what to feed her.  It was also helpful at a quick glance to know exactly what I was low on and needed to replenish.  Would definitely buy and recommend to a friend. I used this for Earth's Best Baby Food and all stages fit well.",5
Graco Pack 'n Play Sheet Tea,I bought them only because I need the sheets for the play yard and I couldn't find any other sheets that would fit.  I thought they would be softer than they were but they are really rough on the skin.  My baby has very sensitive skin so I have to put like a blanket or something under her so that her skin doesn't rub the sheets.  So it really defeats the pupose of buying the sheets.  Don't waste your money on them!!,1
Graco Pack 'n Play Sheet Tea,"I bought this item (in a different color) two years ago for my son.It is NOT waterproof- but what SHEET is?!  I recommend purchasing a 27"" size BRU Especially for Baby Brand waterproof pad to go under the sheet (Just like you would buy a waterproof cover for your crib mattress!).  The sheet will hold the pad in place and fit perfectly over top both the pad and mattress.This sheet is durable and launders easily.I was so pleased with this product, I would purchase it again!  In fact, I did!  I am expecting TWINS, so I purchased another sheet in this color and also TWO of the smaller size for my two Graco Travel Lite Cribs/PNP's.Good job, Graco for coming up with yet another GREAT product!",5
Graco Pack 'n Play Sheet Tea,"We have a Baby Trend playyard, and these sheets fit perfectly.  I only use the sheets when we're traveling and my son uses the playyard to sleep in, and I haven't had any problem with the sheets coming off during sleep (and he's pretty active at night!).I will agree that these sheets are lint magnets.  Also, they're not the softest sheet in the world, but that does make them a bit more durable.  However, since we just use them at night, I would have liked a bit softer sheet.  The sheet is also quite thin.The best thing is to not have high expectations for this sheet.",3
Graco Pack 'n Play Sheet Tea,"I couldn't fathom why the pack'n'play layette bed needed a sheet. The spittle and drool just wipes off, right? Not as easily as you might hope, and these sheets are just the thing to make it easier. They fit perfectly, match fine, and keep muck off the mat. Way to go, Graco - you've done it again!",4
Graco Pack 'n Play Sheet Tea,"This sheet was pretty rough even after being washed several times.  It fits the mattress, but the long sides come untucked easily.  When I use the sheet, I can't use the velcro fastening tabs to keep the mattress down, which is a pain.  My son sleeps in it and doesn't mind it.  Definitely better than just the mattress, but it could be a better design.",3
Graco Pack 'n Play Sheet Tea,was exactly as pictured.  this was a gift for my my niece's baby shower & she loved them.  Would recommend this to anyone.,5
Graco Pack 'n Play Sheet Tea,"I had two of these sheets for my first child because that's all I could find at the time. Other reviewers are right on about the quality. VERY thin and not very soft either. You can see the pattern right through them.Now that we're expecting our second child any day and she'll be sleeping in the play yard for a long bit, I wanted to see what else was out there.I found the following brands at BRU, bought one of each and tried them on the bed. Here's what I found:Nojo: Terrycloth-like fabric. Soft but still a bit thin. They are elasticized though, which is easier to put on and stays on better. There were three colors available at the store (dark blue, light blue, white). Price $9.99Graco quilted sheet: Very plush, though the fabric is synthetic feeling (I didn't check, but I'd guess poly blend). Most comfortable of any that I tried. Will probably use it under a more natural feeling sheet. Elasticized and stayed on well. Was only available in a dark blue. Most expensive at $14.99Carter portable crib sheet: Knit fabric. On the thin side, but soft. Stayed on well, was elasticized and came in at least 4 colors (green, white, blue, yellow). Price $7.99Koala portable crib sheet: Listed thread count of 220 and it felt like a very decent quality. Elasticized, available in a variety of colors (pink, white, blue, green, etc) and one of the cheaper ones out there at $6.99Overall, I was VERY pleased with the options out there. Highly suggest NOT buying these, but going with an elasticized sheet. Both the Carters and Koala sheets are cheaper and are better quality.The Pack 'n Play fitted sheets will only be used as under sheets from now on!",1
Graco Pack 'n Play Sheet Tea,"I purchased a few of these for my daughter's Pack n Play. We used it a few days a week, and even though the sheets are thin, they lasted for several years of use.",4
Graco Pack 'n Play Sheet Tea,"It may just be the color...but it catches and shows the lint very easily.  In a way, this could be good. I can remove the pieces so the baby doesn't play with the lint.",3
Graco Pack 'n Play Sheet Tea,I regret not following the advice of the majority of reviewers on this one. These really are terrible sheets. I have the Graco Cubby Parade Pack N Play and figured the sheets would be good since they're manufactured by the same company. Boy was I wrong. They don't fit the pad very well regardless if it's laying flat for the playpen or if it's set up for the bassinet. Since the bassinet is 3/4 the pad folds up and the sheet doesn't stay put very well at all. They are also cheaply made. Thin isn't even the word. It's upsetting that my Babies r Us only carries this brand. I'm going to return the rest for a store credit and try to find a suitable replacement elsewhere. As for now I am currently using my bassinet w/o a sheet. The pad wipes down well and if i'm going to have my daughter in there for a long time I use a waterproof pad under her. Since she's always wrapped in a blanket she doesn't mind going w/o the sheet.,1
LITTLE SUZY'S ZOO Plush Crib MUSICAL MOBILE,This is an awesomw crib mobile. Suzy zoo items are a challenge to find. This is really cute.,5
Pooh Five - Piece Musical Wall Art,"The Pooh wall art looks really cute up on my little girls wall.  She seems to like it as well, and stares at it all the time.  I like that Eeyore plays music, that is a nice touch.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that the sticker to press to make the music play is off centered, I have to press next to the sticker instead of right on it.  It's no big deal but I think they could have gotten it right. Other than that this is a great decoration!",4
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"We have purchased 3 inflatable snug-tubs from Kelgar. The infant size tub was fine, and still works okay after 2 years. However, the slightly larger toddler size tub has a slow leak. The first one we bought had a very slow leak; after 9 months it turned into a fast leak, so we bought another one, thinking we wouldn't be unlucky enough to get another defective one twice in a row.Wrong!!The second one arrived with a slow leak in the same place as the previous toddler size snug-tub. At first it was so slow, it just meant we'd have to reinflate it once in a while; then you have to reinflate it more and more often until finally it won't last through one bathing without going limp. After the second flop, I decided to just send the leaky tub back to Kel-Gar and ask for a free replacement. They never responded to my friendly letter. When I finally called (took me a while to get around to it; I kept thinking that surely a replacement would be arriving any week now!), they were totally unhelpful.The woman who answered at ""Customer Service"" kept interrupting me to tell me that they do not accept returns, and any problems have to be taken up with the retailer. Way to stand behind your products, dudes!Then when I called the retalier (Right Start) just now, they said that it's not their responsibility to handle a replacement, it's the manufacturer's-- BUT at least this customer service person was polite and said she's ask her boss and look into it more, just to see if there is anything they can do.I'm really surprised that Kel-Gar cares so little about their image with the public and about providing pleasant and helpful service to their customers, especially repeat customers such as myself. I mean, come on, how hard is it to throw a piece of plastic that weights about 8 ounces in the mail to keep a customer happy??However, since that is their attitude, you're better off buying an inflatable tub from a real-life (non-virtual) retailer with a decent 90-day return policy, such as Babies-R-Us or Target, so that if a leak develops you can physically take it back and get a replacement. That's what we'll be doing from here on out.So long, Kel-Gar. The tub was ""just ducky"" but your service was DOA!Update: No go on the replacment. Big surprise.Although not quite as cushy as this tub, I would highly recommend getting your baby or toddler the PRIMO EuroBath instead. We got it after having to give up on inflatables, and it is roomy, comfortable, and DURABLE, unlike Kel-Gar's products. 4.5 stars with 750 reviews on Amazon- you can't beat that!PRIMO EuroBath Pearl White",1
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,This is great! It's so much nicer than the hard plastic tubs. My 6 month old doesn't slide around in this and it's easy for me to rest my arm on the tub while washing her. (Couldn't do that with the plastic tub.) Easy to fill up and easy to clean up. It even has a suction cup so it doesn't slide around in the tub. (I also use that for hanging up so it dries out after every bath.) This tub just makes bathtime much easier!,5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"We used the infant bath tub initially but by the time my daughter turned 2 months we started using this inflatable tub. I put it in the tub and though my daughter doesn't sit up yet, she has plenty of room to move her legs and arms while I hold her. Yes, it is more strenuous for my back but it's good fun and exercise for my baby. Also, we don't have much room in my bathroom so we put up two extension rods (like those you use to hang a shower curtain) above the tub and store it on them. This keeps it out of the way though the tub does have a suction cup which works.I can't wait till my baby sits up - I envision putting the Snug Tub out on the porch for her to play in. O, by the way, I haven't reinflated it once since I bought it (about 2 months ago or so)- yes, some of the air escaped, as with all inflatables, but it's still sturdy enough. I also sometimes put a blanket in it and let my daughter 'sit' in it and play with her toys. I find it very versatile.",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"I used to love giving my daughter a bath when she was a newborn...it was so easy!  Then as she started to become mobile, it was a little less fun - for me anyway!  I got this tub when she was about 4 months old and I haven't looked back (she's now 14 months).  It's SO much easier to wash her hair since she has something soft to lean back on.  I'm also a bit paranoid about germs and it makes me feel more comfortable that she's in a tub that only she uses (vs. the whole family).  It's wonderful to take on trips (especially to hotels...yuk), but just remember to bring a hand pump.  Also, we're having a water shortage now in GA and this uses so much less water than filling the whole bathtub.  Can't say enough about this product!",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,I actually got the Snug Tub Deluxe.  This version comes with inflatable rings that baby can stack on the inflatable post.  It also has an attached inflatable fish that wheezes when you squeeze it.  I used it for the first time tonight and my 6 month old baby enjoyed the freedom to splash and play.  My only caution is to use something to keep baby from slipping.  I put her baby sponge underneath her to elevate her and propr her up.  This was also good to lean her back to wash her hair and to keep her from slipping.  I'm glad I bought this instead of the EuroBath.,5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"This tub is great. It fits nicely in our standard tub. We had another brand tub and it was too snug, but this one fits perfect. My son refuses to take a bath unless he's in this tub.",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"I bought this tub because I was looking for something light, soft and with a drain plug (so I would not have to lift my baby to rinse her). It works great, it is very safe, it drains very well and dries fast. My baby can rest on the sides without touching the wall or anything. I am very happy with my purchase. a last thing, at the beginning the plastic has a strong smell but this goes away after 30 min once inflated.Definitely a ""back saver"" and ""worry saver""!",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,This is the perfect size for my 2 year old . She loves taking baths In it . I'm very pleased with the product,5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,We love this tub.  My son if fairly active in the tub and when he stands and sits during bath time he has plenty of cushion for his behind.  We had purchased a bath seat before he could sit unsupported and after one use discovered how easily they tip over so we got rid of it.  Our 10mo. old son loves this tub and it's small enough as not to overwhelm him but still has plenty of room for his tub toys.  It's great for travel too which is important for safety in the hotel and relative's tubs.,5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"This is perfect for my 15 month baby whose 32 inches long, 26 lbs., it's well made and not slippery at all, easy to clean and the suction cup hold the tub really well.  Great purchase.",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"Perfect for the baby.. So cute and keeps her safe.  Would def recommend this to anyone with a baby.  They are soo slippery that starting them off in a smaller tub of their own, is the way to go..",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"I bought this for my son when he was about six months old - too big for the baby tub in the sink, but not big enough to sit by himself in the full tub. I looked at several reviews for other inserts, but settled on this mainly because it didn't seem (according to reviews) to be as slick on the bottom as others. Though we've not tried other tubs, I do appreciate the ridges on the bottom that help keep a wiggly baby and curious toddler from slipping and possibly going under water. The ridges have allowed him to catch himself if he slips.This fits nicely into the tub - a tight squeeze in my tub, but that keeps it from moving around. The sides also create a bit of a bumper for baby to hold. My son is a tall almost 2 year old and still fits very easily with his legs stretched out. We did have one that sprung a leak and if I'd kept the repair kit that comes with the tub, we would have been fine (unfortunately, it was lost in the abyss). We did, however, like it enough to replace the first with exactly the same model. I'd recommend it!",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,A nice tub. Easy to inflate. Light to carry around. Do not add much weight to hand luggage. A bit smaller than I expect,4
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"We really liked the size of this tub.  Our 1 yr old has room in it and can use it for some time.  It saves water.  I wanted to push the tub toward the back of the larger house tub so that our son was not tempted to pull up on the faucets.  I was going to use the shower hose to fill it.  However, when I tried to drain the tub, the drain on the bottom of the tub would suction to the bottom of the house tub and it wouldn't drain.  I'd have to hold the drain hole off the floor of the tub.  It is too heavy to pick up with water in it.  It will drain if you push the tub to the very front of the bathtub where the drain hole is over at least part of the bathtub drain.  So the tub works, but you can only put it in one place in the front.  I wish they had a little piece under the drain hold that held it off the floor of the bathtub.  Other than that, it is inexpensive and keeps our son contained and safe.",3
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"We bought this tub for our son when he was 9 months old.  He is now 14 months old and LOVES it! It is so easy to use and we really like that you can store it on your shower wall when not in use.  The high sides are an added safety feature as it discourages our son from reaching the edge of the regular tub and start climbing. The price is great, so much so that we bought one for each set of grandparents so that he can have his regular bathtub when we visit them. It does take a good set of lungs to inflate but once it is full of air it stays that way. We have been extremely pleased with this tub!",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"Our 5 month old can sit up unassisted, but our non-skid bathtub prevents us from using the infant seats that suction to the bottom of the tub. The Snug Tub is VERY slippery and dangerous for her right now- moreso than just sitting her in the regular tub!  We are currently using the infant seat tub placed INSIDE the Snug Tub.  Snug Tub will probably be safer and appropriate for her when she is about 8 or 9 months old.",3
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,It's so far so good for my 2 year old girl. It's easy for storage and portable. I can carry it with us while travelling,5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"We brought it to take with us for international travel (so that she is safe in a hotel tub). We started using it about 3 months ago and now it developed a hole. We really liked the tub, so did our daughter, I wish it lasted longer. Now we are 3 weeks before we travel with no portable tub. We followed directions, did not over inflate and did not use the drainage valve (as other owners recommended), but I wish it lasted longer than three months!",2
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"The bottom doesn't keep the air in, ours had a hole. And the bottom plug doesn't go flat, which can be uncomfortable for baby so we avoid that area. Otherwise it's a good size and cute.",3
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"When I had my firstborn lil girl, I was given 3 different types of baby tubs....  The plastic ones pale in comparison with this one!  It's soft enough to keep baby safe from bumps/bruises.  When my girl was still too small to sit up on her own, I just used one of those foam bath tub thingies to assist in keeping her above the water level  ;)  Now that she can sit up she loves to hang on to the sides & splash around ... I feel secure with this tub b/c if she slips backwards it's cushioned on the bottom to keep her lil noggin from hurting  ;)",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"We've had this tub for a little over a month, bought it when my daughter was about 9.5 months. She had finally gotten too big for the infant tub & couldn't really move around comfortably.  I had the yellow ducky tub for my twin boys when they were younger, I loved that one as well, but it was a little harder to store because of the duck head. This tub was easy to inflate, easy to drain, and has a suction cup that you can use to hang on the tub wall to dry.  No complaints here! It has plenty of room for here to play, she doesn't slide around in it too easily, and if she loses her balance while she's splashing & being silly, this tub provides a ""cushion"" around her so she doesn't hit her head on the big tub. Excellent purchase (although I do think it's a little over priced.)",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,I'll get right to it . . .easy to inflate . . .baby loves it . . .highly recommended =),5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"Holds air really good, easy to blow up, fits a 2 year old.  Bought it for travel and use it at home because we like it so much.  Easy to pack in a suitcase, doesn't take up much space.  If you want the water to drain...dump the water out!  It has a plug but turning it over is easy.",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"We bought this to make bathing a bit more simple and that is what this does.  Now bathing is easier, less time consuming and feels a bit more comfy for the baby.",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"We found this item while on vacation and did not want to place our son in the hotel bathtub!  It turned out to be one of the best purchases we've made!  I don't think I'd use it for a small infant, but if your child is stable and can sit up on their own, it's the perfect solution when the child is too large for the traditional &quot;infant&quot; tub and not yet ready for the family bathtub.  It saves a huge amount of water as well.  Our son played in the tub for so long because he felt secure and all his toys stayed within his reach!  When you're finished bathing your child, you just hang this tub up to dry out completely and it's ready for next time.Our son was able to use this tub for a very long time.  I'd recommend it to anyone with an older child.",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"We bought this tub 3 months ago for our 6 month old daughter.  It was great until it developed a slow leak on a seam.  We would just have to re-inflate it a bit before each use, but now it won't even make it through one bath.  Since it had only been 3 months, I called Amazon to see if they would replace it.  Amazon told me I needed to contact the manufacturer, Kelgard.  When I contacted them I was told to contact Amazon.  So bottom line is no one seems to want to send us a replacement.  It is great until it leaks.  Is sure seems like we should have gotten more than 3 months use from it!",2
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"The purchase of this product was very smooth and I was so excited to get this tub!  Our daughter had outgrown her infant tub and needed something a little bigger to sit and splash around in.  This was great, for a while.  It's slightly bigger than some other inflatable tubs, so if you have a small tub be prepared for a squeeze.  I also liked that you could keep it inflated and hang it to dry using the suction cup attachment.  Unfortunately, it only lasted a few months before a very small tear appeared on the side seem.  I would expect that to happen eventually after extended use, but we only had it a short time and only deflated and blew it back up 2-3 times within that time span (for traveling).  May be we just got a defective tub, but I didn't want to take the chance of wasting money on another tub only for the same thing to happen again, so I ordered a different one.  Bummer.",2
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"Purchased this tub for my 8 month old. This tub is great for little ones! Minimal water needed, padded on bottom (which was surprising, as I was expecting a flat sheet of plastic on the bottom), drains well. My son loves bathing in it.  He has on occasion thrown himself backwards in it, but no worries here. The sides are well padded and the bottom is also padded, so no injuries. Just keep in mind you do not have to fill it all the way up to give a good bath. If you fill it too deep and your child throws themselves backwards or slips, then they would go under the water. Just use common sense when using the product. Overall, VERY pleased with this purchase!",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"Our daughter has used this since she outgrew her baby tub. She's now almost 2 years old and we still use it. It fits snuglly and offers a nice bit of safety for her in the tub, since she's still a little too small for the full bathtub. She hasn't slipped much on the bottom, but it can be a little slick. But we are always right next to her so this hasn't presented a problem at all.",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"This is the best purchase i made on amazon, my baby loved it , i will recommend it to everyone",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"We love this tub.  It lets my daughter play in the tub without me having to hang on to her.  Before we got this, she was likely to slip and seemed to feel unsecure in the big tub.  Now she plays and seems comfortable.  I like that it saves water also.  It took some air to blow up but we leave it blown up and hang it on the wall of the tub when we are not using it.  Definitely worth the money, it solved all our problems.",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT buy this product!!!!!!!!!!!!! The tub is made of PVC vinyl which is also known as  the ""poison plastic"". PVC is NOT a safe material. Please read up on PVC and it's effects on the human body if you aren't sure about it. I think you will be blown away by what you read. I contacted the company and they said that this tub meets government regulations. Unbelievable that the government doesn't insist that companies use safer materials for the children and the environment.,1
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"We have been using this snug tub for a few months now and find that it was a solid purchase. It's great not having to fill an entire tub for one little person. The snug tub fits right into our standard bathtub. We have to use a bowl to divert the water from the spout into the tub or half of it goes down the drain. After bath time, water goes down the drain easily leaving only a little bit in the tub for us to dump out. This tub will also be easy to deflate and travel with this summer!",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,Bought this for my baby granddaughter's recent visit.  My daughter is so happy with it that she wants to take it home with her!  Nice size.  Soft for baby.Has a large suction cup to hang it from the shower wall when not in use and has a drain hole at opposite end so drains and dries nicely,5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"My 16 month old loves taking baths in this tub. It has eased her transition from the infant tub. It's very easy to use and clean.My only issue is that it doesn't fit all that well in my small bathtub, but I can still kind of jam it in without risk of damaging it.I love that I can fill it up and not waste water.",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"Nothing I could say would do this tub justice! I think every Mom should have one! It really is a great transition between the infant tub and the big tub. I purchased this for my 9 month old son who was using one of the traditional blue bath seats. The seat doesn't allow you to clean the baby's bottom and he would constantly slide toward the front bar squishing his &quot;little boy parts&quot;. The Snug-tub gets rid of that problem! He sits up well in it and the cushions protect him from the hard surfaces of the tub. He is free to play with his toys and explore in a safe environment (with Mom by his side at all times, of course)! It is worth every penny!!",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"My son is approaching 40 lbs, and while he does fit into the tub easily, he is pretty rough.  As a result, the last two of these tubs I ordered lasted about a week before they started leaking air.  When he was smaller, and less rough, the tub lasted several months of daily use.  A great product for small kids.",4
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"The good:It lasted about 6 months and never leakedIt really did fit my tub well and helped the transistion from sink to tub for bathing.The bad:Once it goes.....it goes.  It developed a slow leak on day and went into the trash.  Felt wasteful, after that we decided to bathe our daughter in a rubbermaid bin instead.  So far so good.",3
Medela 100% Cotton Washable Nursing Bra Pads,"These score an A with me for eco-friendliness, but a C for effectiveness. They tend to kind of leak--as in they get saturated and then my bra gets wet and then my shirt gets wet. It would be nice if they had some sort of more waterproof fabric on the outside to prevent that from happening. That being said, I'm not sure if there is a better fabric option.",3
Medela 100% Cotton Washable Nursing Bra Pads,"Good and soft nursing pads, more discreet than other pads, hold up well after several washes.",5
Medela 100% Cotton Washable Nursing Bra Pads,"I have been using the Lansinoh Disposable Nursing Pads, but were given these Medela ones as a gift. They are much more thicker than the disposable ones and very easily seen under my clothes. It was not attractive at all. The Lansinoh disposable Nursing Pads are much more discrete and comfortable than these. These are nice that they are reusable but to thick for my taste.",3
Medela 100% Cotton Washable Nursing Bra Pads,"They absorb well. However, you will have to wear a padded bra in order for the seams on these pads not to show and/or look pointy.",4
Medela 100% Cotton Washable Nursing Bra Pads,I tried Medelea's disposable nursing pads as well as 2 other brands of reusable pads.  These are the only ones that don't irritate my skin. It is true that if you have major leaking the milk will soak through but it has been my experience that this is the case for all nursing pads.,5
Medela 100% Cotton Washable Nursing Bra Pads,"When I learned that there were WASHABLE nursing pads, I was excited! I tend to go through nursing pads pretty quickly. These are comfortable, even when saturated...so comfortable, that I hadn't noticed that they were saturated and leaked everywhere! To combat that, I ended up backing the washable nursing pads up with a disposable pad. I go through a lot less nursing pads now! Because of this, I am now going through 1 washable pad about every other day and have to change the disposables even less often. FYI: When washing these, they tend to fold themselves up in the dryer, but they smooth back out easily with wear.Some people may notice that this is the same review as the Lansinoh Washable Nursing Pads, 8 ct. That is because I used these two brands of nursing pads together.I didn't really like the small washing bag that came with these Medela pads. There wasn't much room to put more than 4 pads in it. I think a bigger bag should come in it because there is no way the pads can be clean with them so stuck together.",4
Medela 100% Cotton Washable Nursing Bra Pads,"These are a little to big for me (even thought I have big-uns).  They tend to get wrinkles in them and you can see them through a shirt, an under shirt, and a bra all at once.  Not my favorite.  They are, however very absorbant.",2
Medela 100% Cotton Washable Nursing Bra Pads,They are beautiful when you buy them but they  get lumpy and bumpy after you wash them and that looks really weird under the bra. Also they are not that absorbent. I bought them at Target.,1
Medela 100% Cotton Washable Nursing Bra Pads,The disposable nursing pads felt like fiberglass on my nipples - even the extra soft ones ... so out of desperation I went to Target and bought these and they are SO COMFORTABLE! Plus they hold my leaks no problem,5
Medela 100% Cotton Washable Nursing Bra Pads,These are so incredibly comfortable!  The disposable kind seem more convenient but are very abrasive to sensitive areas.  These wash up great and are super soft.  I never had leak issues either.,5
Medela 100% Cotton Washable Nursing Bra Pads,"I bought these to use during the day at work and so far they've worked great. They're easy to wash and dry, I just throw them in with my regular clothes. I didn't give it 5 stars because you can't wear these with thin clothes or they show. I wear them with a bra that has light padding so it works great that way, but if you wear a thin bra with a silk shirt or dress it would show. I love them though and I still have an unopened box of disposable bra pads that I received as a gift and will probably not use. I bought two packs and might get another one so that I don't have to wash them during the week. Why buy disposables? Seems pretty wasteful to me.",4
Medela 100% Cotton Washable Nursing Bra Pads,Mine got all bunched up after the first washing.  They'd be really noticeable under a tshirt.  I wore them overnight and woke up feeling all swampy and a bit ithcy.  I only wore them once.,1
Medela 100% Cotton Washable Nursing Bra Pads,"I bought these to use around the house and overnight in the hopes of saving money. They are fairly absorbent, but they do leak sometimes, and they shrink a bit on the first wash. I now pair them with a Lansinoh disposable (which I LOVE!), as it helps protect against any extra leaks.",4
Medela 100% Cotton Washable Nursing Bra Pads,"I didn't want to be wasteful with all of those disposables, but even with my thickest bra these were visible, and in order to have enough around to always have a clean set available it just seemed silly (I mean, new mom nursing a baby isn't doing laundry very often... unless you're doing cloth diapers I guess, in which case maybe this makes a ton of sense...)",3
Medela 100% Cotton Washable Nursing Bra Pads,They're fine if you want to change them out every hour.  I'm a working mom and I over-produce and leak more than other women. These leaked through so quickly.  I much prefer Nuk reusable nursing pads.,3
Baby Basics - Knit Crib Sheet - Ecru,"I purchased 2 of these sheets, one in ecru and one in white.  Both of them had small holes in them right out of the package.  More have appeared after several uses and several runs through the washing machine.  Kind of like the tiny holes that start appearing in t-shirts after they've been worn over and over again.  They are nice and soft, but they need to make them a little thicker to stand up to the wear and tear.",3
PureLan 100,"This tube is a life saver!  I recommend buying 3 tubes, keep one near the bed, one in the bathroom after a shower and one to keep in your pocket.",5
PureLan 100,I starting using the lanolin in the first few days then stopped because I thought it wasn't working. I quickly realized how much it aided in the moisturizing of my nipples because they began to crack. I then went back to using the lanolin and they healed immediately. Highly recommend using this product and don't stop until the first week or 2!,5
KidCo Configure Gate 24&quot; Extension,"We bought this to prevent our 1-year-old from ""exploring"" the gas fireplace.  We purchased one extra insert to fit the space, and the thing works beautifully. It's sturdy, the slots are close enough together that one can't fit their hands too far through them, and the closing mechanism is hard for even an adult to open/close. The only thing we didn't use are the bolts that attach the extreme edges to the walls.",5
KidCo Configure Gate 24&quot; Extension,I ordered a KidCo Elongated child gate. A recommended extension needed to be purchased. The wrong extension was sent. I needed G24 model and received 24"" extension for a different model.,1
KidCo Configure Gate 24&quot; Extension,I have had the Kidco Gate for 5 years now and moved it to many locations and it works great. Solid construction and holds up well to kids!,5
KidCo Configure Gate 24&quot; Extension,"This gate definitely met my expectations.  As we are temporarily living with my parents, our baby's room is in the living room.  I needed a gate that would safely section off the 12 feet between the two walls.  This gate (with extensions) spans the room and seems very secure to contain our crawling/climbing 8 month old.",5
KidCo Configure Gate 24&quot; Extension,"I recently ordered this extension for our configure gate. It came within a few days of ordering. I opened it, followed the easy to understand directions, and had the gate modified and operational in about 15 minutes.Thanks for the easy online experience.",4
KidCo Configure Gate 24&quot; Extension,"The description says it is for the G80, and that is what I needed. Even the picture is of the correct one. However, they sent me an extension for the G4300 series. They are not compatable with each other. Can we say ""False Advertisement"". Yet, Amazon allows for easy return and refund.",2
Philips AVENT Breast Milk Storage,"We used Avent with our 1st baby and loved it. Now that we are expecting another munchkin, we planning on using them again.I loved these. I loved how simple it made it to store my milk. Straight from the Isis Pump to my fridge/freezer. Simple. Yes, the defrosting takes longer than some alternatives, but I always had a bottle in the fridge while one was defrosting. I found warming it in a boiling pot of water to work the best for quick defrost. They do take up more room than the bags when storing, but I think the convience outweighed that problem. I stored milk in the fridge and freezer and learned to rotate so room wasn't a terrible problem. (If you do this, it is important to label and date the containers) This also saved me from defrosting last minute. I had some leaking issues from time to time, but figured it out. If you tighten the container/bottle too much it will leak. Simple fix...don't over-tighten. (Avent's site has a short trouble shooting list for leakage problems) We tried other products, but Avent was the best for our family.",5
Philips AVENT Breast Milk Storage,i found these containers great for storing brest milk in the freezer.  they are small and dont take up to much space.  the also fit perfect from freezer straight to the bottle warmer. i recommend this product for mothers who will be breast feeding and returning back to work.,5
Philips AVENT Breast Milk Storage,"These sturdy containers make storing and feeding breastmilk very simple. I am using a combination of bags and these containers, but these are the easiest so far. Great choice if using the Avent system for bottlefeeding/pumping.",5
Philips AVENT Breast Milk Storage,Easy container for storage and stacks nicely.Jennifer,5
Philips AVENT Breast Milk Storage,These storage bottles are great because you can use them to store breast milk or formula. I like making a few bottles at night then later at night as I need them I warm a bottle take storage top off and add a nipple and I am ready to feed my daughter. I love all the avent products because of how easy everything is to use.,5
Philips AVENT Breast Milk Storage,"I love these containers.  I have the Isis breast pump and these attaqch directly to it and then I just pop in the disk and freeze.  I don't have a problem defrosting them at all, just soak in warm water.  Although I do try to defrost ahead of time if I know I'll need to use it.",5
Philips AVENT Breast Milk Storage,They're great containers but it's better to just buy avent bottles to keep the milk in instead. If you need to use bottles for the milk anyway just skip the step of putting it in a container and transering the milk. Now I have 9 containers that I don't even use becuase I just use the bottles for storage and feeding. The 4oz bottles are the same as the containers.,1
Philips AVENT Breast Milk Storage,"I bought these containers/bottles before I had my dd 11/06/99 and they have been through the microwave, freezer, dishwasher and have been sterilized by boiling. They have been used as milk containers, bottles and food containers.We currently use them with the avent sippy cup teats and they are leak proof.We will be having another baby shortly and I think they will probably outlast the the next baby too...Probably one of the best investments I have made baby wise.",5
Philips AVENT Breast Milk Storage,I used to use the disposable bags to store breastmilk in the freezer even though we used regular Avent bottles. When I found out these could be used in the freezer I switched and I LOVE IT! They CAN be used with the MEDELA PUMPS. There is a converter cap you can buy seperately to pump DIRECTLY into these bottles from most pumps! I would highly recommend trying this product.,5
Philips AVENT Breast Milk Storage,Thought this bottle would have been great since I've used it with my older daughter about 7 years ago but boy was I wrong!!! They've added a new piece to it to stop leakage but its the worst ever & a waste of $$$$!!!! It leaks with the storage caps things then after warming & you add the nipple & leak storage ring out leaks more when feeding!!! I highly don't recommend buying..,1
Philips AVENT Breast Milk Storage,"These are great. They don't leak and are nice and sturdy. The tops come off and nipple tops can be directly attached. After he stopped with these bottles, I used them since they had flat closed tops, to shake up his formula. I love Avent products and these are wonderful.They attach to the bottom of the Avent VIA Isis pump directly which was nice. Great for storage of baby food later on as well. Tops can be used with 9ounce bottles as well.",5
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"I love this gadget.  I bought two extra bases for my infant car seat for both my husband's and my mother's car.  Unlike my car, there center seat has a harness strap.  Those are hard to get really tight.  My center seat has just the lap belt and it was easy to secure the base.  With the harness strap it was just too hard to get the seat in tight enough.  With the mighty tight, it was a snap.  You just hooked it in, cranked it, and voula!!!That seat isn't going anywhere.  I love it.  It is easy to use, it makes the seat secure, and it is sturdy.  You must have this if you are trying to secure a seat in a position with a shoulder harness.",5
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"I'm shocked that someone gave this only 1 star...  This little ""dodad"" is so easy to install and it really gets the carseat in tight (won't budge an inch)!  I also like the fact that they've attached the instructions to the product (that way I don't have to dig out the instructions).  I had my sons carseat put in tightly by a police officer unfortunately, my husband and I switch cars often and I could never get it back in as tight as the officer did.  With this product,  it goes in tight every time......  This would make a great baby shower gift!!!",5
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"No matter how much I fooled with the little metal thing that came with the carseat, it never seemed tight enough and it was hard to do.  With the mighty tight, you just snap it on and crank it tight.  The seat is in so tight now that it doesn't budge.  I love it so much that I give these as baby shower gifts.  Highly recommend!!",5
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"There is a review on this site saying the reason CPSTs don't recommend this is because then we'd be out of a job. No, the reason we don't recommend these is because they're unsafe and do more harm than good.The instructions for this product actually negate the use of it. It says &quot;instsall per carseat manufacturer's instructions&quot; and then put this on afterwards. If you install the seat following the manufacturer's directions not only will you not need this product, you'll also note that it says not to add after market products to your seat.Hrm.I'm one CPST who won't be losing their job by this product flying off the shelves. I'm a volunteer who pays for my travel, training and certification out of my own pocket. And I still don't like the Mighty Tite.If you are having trouble getting your carseat installed correctly, contact a technician in your area. They can be found via the Safe Kids website [...] or through NHTSA [...] most will more than happy to meet with you and help you learn to install your seat safely and correctly and without the use of an aftermarket product such as this.",1
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,I just purchased one of these awesome products for my sister's new baby to come home from the hospital. She has an older car with unsafe seat belts. This product was easy to apply and remove and really did a great job at getting the seat in tight. I am right now placing a new order for two more for my kids! Would recommend this to anyone!!,5
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,bought another one for our other car.  works great. easy to install and remove.  can't find in store so we bought online.,5
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"following the guide that came with your car seat eliminates the  need for this device.  Basically I put my knee in the center of the car seat and put about half my weight into the car seat, tighten the belt and poof I am done...this widget does basically that, but consumer reports and other similar organizations/agencies concur it is a waste of money.",1
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,I rate this product excellent.  It removes the slack of safety in car seats for children.  It secures the seat and removes any slack from the seat belt in which it prevents the car seat from moving or slidding.  It adds safety to our children and that is priceless.Mark Balelo,5
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"You may think that this product is getting your seat in tightly and safely, but you are wrong.  This product gets your seat in too tight and damages your seatbelt.  With a damaged seat belt, there will be no portection for your child in a crash.I am a Certified Car Seat Technician and this is considered an ""aftermarket"" or ""non-regulated"" product.  This means that the car seat was not tested for safety with this product on it.  There is no way to tell how the product will react in a crash.If the product comes off the seatbelt during a crash, you will have a projectile floating about in your car likely hitting you and your child.  When you are in a crash, you multiply your speed times the weight of the projectile to get its force.  Consider 35 pounds of force hitting your child.  Does that seem safe to you?You must also consider your ease of use vs. your child's safety.  Is 10 minutes to make sure the seat is in tightly worth the possibility of this malfunctioning?The biggest mistake most people make when putting in a car seat is not putting weight into it when installing it.  Put your foot, hand, knee, etc. into the seat when installing it.  This takes out the extra air in the car's seat and gives you a tight fit.I understand that car seat instructions can be confusing, but seek out a certified tech to help.  Most Health Departments and Police Departments have Certified Techs who would be happy to educate you on the easiest and safest ways to install a car Seat.Please do not buy this product and if you already own it, please stop using it---for the sake of your child and yourself......",1
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"I got this car seat tightener because my 2000 Explorer does not have tether attachments--ironically, my Jeep Wrangler (a not-so-family car) DOES have tether attachments!  It was very difficult to get my son's car seat in tight enough to keep it from really moving around in a crash.  I LOVE this product!! If you can get your car seat installed by a certified tech, that's great and it's the way to go.  BUT my son's car seat is quite often going back and forth between our car and Grandma's car for Grandma-Fun-Days.  Are we going to go to a tech every time we move the car seat back and forth?! Yeah, right.  The Mighty-Tite is the ONLY reason I feel that my son is safe in my mom's car.  I get it in there SO tight every time, and really quickly, too.  This product is on my list of must-haves before my daughter arrives in May.",5
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"First off, this may have been crash tested, but since there are currently no regulations and no standards for it to meet, anything can say it meets the current standards.  A piece of duct tape could claim the same thing.  The biggest problem with this is that is winds all the seatbelt up in it.  In a crash, if it breaks (which it very likely might do), your seat will be VERY loose at the exact instant you need it to be very tight.I have seen this item shred vehicle seat belts, cut through seatbelts (that would be fun in a crash), and jam seatbelts so they are no longer usable.If you can't get your seat in tight without an extra device (that most car seat manufacturers specifically say NOT to use) you aren't doing it right.  If you seat gets loose after a few days, you aren't doing it right.  If to get a correct fit, you need a device like this, either the car seat is incompatible with your car or, you guessed it, you aren't doing it right.  In any of these cases, go see a certified child passenger safety technician.  Yes, they have 4 days of training and that is enough to know how to install seats.  If 4 days of training isn't enough, why would someone think one $15 device can solve everything?  Get information from people who are educated specifically on car seats.  You can find information on this at [...]",1
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"After reviewing the other reviews and using mighty-tite for a few months- I'd say the following:1. 'Warnings' of technicians should always be listened to reviewed....I reviewed their testing and results. I was unable to find any evidence of its failure- or even a negative review of someone who used and/or tested it. I would, of course, love for many agencies to conduct their own exhaustive reviews.2. Personal use- it's worked very well and secured my child's car seat much better than the car's existing system. You can't move it an inch.3. As with all good things- it can be overdone. Be aware that putting all your effort into over-tightening can compromise your car's CRS. Use it within reason. ;)My conclusion is that it's safer to use than not. (I went on-line to buy one for someone- and here I am in the reviews!!)",5
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,The instructions were clear and easy to follow?  This item made the car seat made for an extra secure ride,5
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"There are some things you might want to take into consideration when deciding whether or not to purchase this product.  You may want to try one in your vehicle since there is some truth to the fact that it doesn't fit well in all vehicles.  Also, it can be slightly troublesome to remove until you are used to removing it.  Those are the only negatives that can be applied to this product.  Just like anything in life, you must use good judgment and common sense when using it.  Familiarize yourself with it before using it.  Don't over-tighten it.  Make sure you are comfortable installing and removing it before you make any drastic decisions.  This is a well built item with a minimal amount of working components that could fail.  I would bet my life on this product if I had to and feel confident that if I were in a crash my children would be safe.  This is especially true for vehicles that are not the usual ones you put your car seat into.  Every vehicle is different, especially older makes and models.  This product has proven itself to my family and in my book, should be considered a mandatory item when purchasing any car seat.",5
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"If you sort these reviews by the star rating you will find that many of the low ratings were given by &quot;car seat technicians&quot; or people acting on their advice.The goal of any seat is to be as firmly connected to the car as possible.  This is why aircraft and racecar seats are bolted directly to the frame with wide (unstretchable) belts to hold the passenger firmly in place.It is true that this product can put more tension into the seat belt than a person could by hand. I think that if it is used with moderate, resonable force, there would not be any damage to the car or car seat.  It only needs to be as tight as is required to meet the &quot;one inch of motion&quot; requirement that appears in most car seat manuals.I believe that this is a great product and will continue to use it.",5
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"We have an older car with only a lap belt (no anchors) to fasten the car seat.  Without the Mighty Tite, there is no way to tighten the belt to prevent our 18 month old and her car seat  from sliding sideways in a sudden stop.  With the Mighty Tite, the car seat is really tight against the car's back seat, and she does not move.  Case closed as far as I am concerned.",5
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"There's a lot of controversy surrounding the safety of 3rd party items such as the Mighty Tite.  I think each parent should weigh the pros and cons of using it in each individual car.  I think in some scenarios, it's appropriate to use.I bought one a few years back after a friend recommended it to me, but I found it wasn't necessary with my 2002 Toyota Sienna.  I was able to get the seat in tightly by itself.  Fast forward 2 years; I'm now driving a 1992 Mazda MPV with the older, non-locking seatbelts.  Having to use the locking clip makes it very difficult to get that tight fit with just the belt.  Thankfully, I still had the Mighty Tite!  Now, is is a very important tool that helps me install the carseat tight with minimal play.Now I have to wonder how long Amazon will be out of stock!  I just had another child ealier this month and realized I need a second Mighty Tite!  ;o)",4
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"As the father of two girls, ages 4 and 1, please allow me to tell you from experience what a terrific product this is.  My only regret is that I didn't get until until recently, because it would have saved me countless hours installing car seats.  I don't care if you have extra car seats, you will always moving them in and out, switching cars with family members, vacuuming the car, etc.,--you will use this product.  Imagine this scenario: Grandma is watching the kids for a rare night night at the movies.  Invariably you have grossly underestimated how long it would take to get the kids and yourselves ready, and showtime is rapidly approaching.  You're just about to walk out the door when in an instant of guilt and embarrassment you realize you better put the car seat in Grandma's car, in case of emergency.  Suffice it to say that this process will cause you to miss all of the trailers and the first ten minutes of the movie.  Anyone who has struggled to install a car seat to ensure baby's safety knows that this process takes time, good technique, strength, agility, sweat, and a fair amount of cussing.  In addition, if your car's seat belts need to retract fully before they will feed out again, there will also be trial and error.  One of the tricks is to ensure the lap part of the belt is cinched down tightly at the buckle, while you have applied enough pressure (body weight) into the seat to ensure the seat does not rock side-to-side.  Mighty Tite makes this process a breeze!  Just play the belt through the seat as normal, cinch the lap belt to the buckle to remove excessive play, and then crank up ol' Mighty Tite to torque down the seat.  I won't suggest what potentially bad situation could occur, but regardless, that seat is going to stay put... Thanks I hope this product makes you all rich.  You deserve it.",5
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"THIS PODUCT IS DANGEROUS!!! THIS HAS NOT BEEN CRASH TESTED AND CAN OVER TIGHTEN YOUR SEAT BELT!!!

Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,The Mighty Tite Car Seat Belt Tightener is the best baby product ever.  Your car seat will never be tighter and your baby will never be more safe.  It is very easy to install and remove when necessary.  Mighty Tite is a must for everyone.,5
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"Hi-We bought the Mighty Tite belt tightener for our infant seat.  We thought we were doing a good thing by adding security to the infant seat. When our son grew into a toddler seat, we unbuckled the seat belt and removed the Mighty Tite.  To our surprise, it had begun to damage our seat belt, and completely defeating its purpose!  We were advised by our city police to remove the Mighty Tite and NOT use it.  They said a locking clip is just as effective, and not going to ruin our seatbelt.  Think about your child's safety and risk before you decide to buy it.",1
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,We use the Mighty Religously.And we were in a rear ending--unknown impact force as I was driving 45mph and was purposefully rear ended by a very agressive hit and run drive.  I had to replace the rear door on my mini-van. The dent was rather impressive seeing as I was driving 45mph at the time.Mighty Tight had no problems.We did replace them and the car seats s suggested.  We do relocate seats often enough that it hasn't allowed the opportunity for the belt to relax over time.It is a wonderful product.,5
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"I absolutely LOVE this product.  I purchased one for each of our carseats - three all together.  I would NEVER be without it again.  It's easy to install and remove.  Whenever our children ride in someone else's car, this goes too!All you do is slip your seatbelt into the tightener after your seat is belted into the car.  Then start cranking the handle.  (no more sweating!!) When you're finished, your child's carseat won't budge!!  I mean it!!Finally, no more worrying about whether your child's seat is tight enough!I highly recommend this product.  I wish I'd had it a long time ago.",5
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"I am a certified Child Passenger Safety Instructor for over 10 years.  These are NOT safety tested and can void all warranties for the automobile and carseat. You auto insurance may also  claim that you used an unapproved product.  The government has strict standards for carseats to pass crash tests  FMVSS 213.  If the product does not have that stated on the product then it can be more of a danger.  If you can not install a carseat with less than 1&quot; of movement,  you may need to move it to another seating position, get another seat or contact a Certified Child Safety technician in your area.  (NHTSA, Highway Patrol, Police, Fire Dept, Health Dept,) Keep them seated and buckled.",1
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,This is a wonderful new gadget for parents!  I have two older kids and didn't have this little beauty when they were babies.  I didn't even know there was such a thing...I drive a minivan and my husband drives a SUV and it works perfectly in our cars.  This lock helps to secure the car set like no other thing out there.  I am very picky about how tightly my kids' seats fit in the car.  I try to shake and pry them loose to make sure they are tight enough...there is no movement when you use this baby!  This is a definite must have for all new parents!,5
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"Ok, this is the best thing if you really want to get your car seat in right and tight. Nothing works like it. But buyer beware--install this thing wrong and you are in for hours of misery. You can ratchet your seat belt in something fierce and you'll end up feeling like a wolve in a bear trap trying to knaw the mighty tite off the seat belt--and if you can't unwind it there is no way to unscrew the thing--its got triangle screws. I've called the manufacturer on two seperate occasions and never did get a response. So my advise--get it but use caution when installing.",4
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,This is a great product. I feel that my child is completely secure using this device on her carseat.,5

Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"I have a 2002 Nissan Pathfinder and purchased the Britax Advantage infant to toddler carseat. Unfortunately, my truck was manufactured a few months to early for the LACTH system, so no matter how hard I tried I could not tighten the seatbelt enough to properly secure my baby's carseat. I decided to purchase the Mighty Tight, after 3 cranks the belt was tightened and the carseat wouldn't even budge. It has been a month now since it's installation and it is still secure.",5
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"My car is a 97' model and the back seatbelts don't lock when you pull them out all the way.  I was tired of turning a sharp corneror making a turn and seeing my 2 year olds car seat tilt to one side or another.  So, i thought i would take a chance and buy it and am so glad i did.  It is so easy to install and to remove.  It keeps the seat nice and tight and no longer worry about our daughter tilting.  I would recommend this to every parent with a older and even a newer model car.",5
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,We bought one of these when my son was a newborn (2 1/2 years ago) because we were concerned about his safety and took his seat to have it inspected at the hospital.  They told us that these are not recommended and can be dangerous because they can come unlatched.  Car seat manufacturers don't recommend them either.  We had no problems getting his car seat installed tightly without this gimmick!,1
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"We used this device in several non-LATCH equipped cars during the years that my daughter was in a rear-facing infant seat and later, a car seat.  It was a sanity saver for installing the seat tightly enough.  Even sitting on top of my child's car seat and pushing with all my weight against the roof of my car would not get the car seat tight enough so that there was less than 1"" of play at the buckle like the instructions say.For those who are concerned that this device could cut the car's seat belts, I'll just offer our own experience with it in a crash.  We were rear-ended by a texting teenager with enough force to throw our spare tire 40 feet into a cornfield and to buckle up the rear floor of our van a good 12"" inches. Our vehicle was totalled. The van, and its seat belts, were over 10 years old at the time; the Mighty-Tite did not cut or shred the belt. In fact, if installed properly, the belt material is rolled around a steel bar.  It's no more likely to shred or cut the seat belt than the car's own seat-belt storage reel is. I would hazard a guess that those who found belt damage after an accident would have found such damage regardless of the Mighty-Tite. Car seat belts are supposed to be replaced after a serious wreck because of exactly this kind of possible damage.FOR ME (everyone has, of course, a different level of comfort with these sorts of things) I feel the use of a device which has been on the market over a decade without removal due to lawsuits is a lesser risk to take than not having a car seat installed tightly enough in an older, non-LATCH equipped vehicle.",5
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"This product is invaluable, but a little tricky to use at first.  We have a Camry and an older Chevy.  This belt tightener works great in both cars.  The seat won't budge.  Getting the belt really tight is a snap.  Occasionally you may have to re-set the belt if the seat starts to lean to one side.  (This is a testament to the ability of the Mighty Tight to secure the belt tightly rather than a product flaw).  The reason for the tilt is the use of uneven padding within or on top of the back seat.The money is well worth it unless you are a certified technician who knows how to securely fasten safety seats.Four stars are given due to some akwardness in releasing the latch when removal is desired.  On the other hand, you don't have to worry about the belt releasing pre-maturely.The latch is only rated to approximately 60 pounds.  For older children another device should be used.",4
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - Blue,"These are great -- we have two so that when one is dirty, we can have a clean one.  But they snag, very easily, in the washing machine.  A lot of times, I find that it works just as well to use the changing table pad without a cover -- the plastic is much easier to clean up and you don't have to do laundry.  A receiving blanket over the plastic cover works just as well, and washes up better ;)",3
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - Blue,"My son is now 12 months old, and we have had this item since he was born and love it.  We have two covers in different colors, and this works perfect.  When one is in the wash, the other is on.  I haven't had any problems with shrinking in the wash, and I don't really understand the need for the slots either as the straps come up under the cover.  The only issue I have seen is that both covers did get some pulls early on.  No big deal, though.  Sometimes I turn them inside out and use them that way.  The pulls happened really early on and haven't gotten any worse.  I love these covers and would highly recommend them to anyone!",5
Prince Lionheart Stroller Bag,"I bought this bag for my daughter to use on her full size stroller. It's fantastic.  It has a very strechy elastic top and the bag it's self is very strechy allowing you to get tons into it.  We often have two large heavy purses in it and the top snap closes it up for extra security. When we don't have purses in it, it's great for an extra blanket, snacks, toys, or small packages.  We also have the ""mommy hook"" and it's great for large bags and for purses when the Prince Lionhart bag is full of baby things.  Between the two there is just about nothing you can't carry safely and securely on the stroller.  We love it.",5
Prince Lionheart Stroller Bag,"I bought the Prince Lionheart Stroller Bag for a lot less than the price listed here at a discount store.The bag istself is kind of cheap. It's basically a fish-net style bag that has straps which buckle around the handles of your stroller.I think it looks unattractive, but with an umbrella stroller, it does give you a place to stash a few toys and other items (nothing heavy though) - and you don't have to take it off the umbrella stroller to collapse it, which is convenient. I really didn't understand how to use the hooks to rig the bag up so it doesn't just hang down and bump into your legs while you push the stroller. After a few tries I managed to rig it up, but I don't know if I did it correctly...no directions on or in the box about it.It's not bad, but there may be better alternatives (though you may have to connect and disconnect those every time you open and close the stroller).",3
"Neat Solutions Sesame Street Table Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Placemats, 20-Count","These peel and stick mats are very convenient and easy to use, and much better than a dirty restaurant table.  Unfortunately kids over 12 months or so often love peeling them off the table as much as they love eating off of them.  If you normally drive to restaurants, I think aFisher-Price Healthy Care Booster Seat(or something similar with its own firmly attached tray) is a better option.  These placemats are worthwhile when you need something ultra-portable, though.",4
"Neat Solutions Sesame Street Table Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Placemats, 20-Count","I loved this product for a while, but now my baby who's just over a year pulls them off any surface and I keep having to press them back down and try to distract him from pulling them.  Still preferable to the restaurant table surface though.",4
"Neat Solutions Sesame Street Table Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Placemats, 20-Count","Love this product. It's easy to use, easy to take along, clean up is a cinch. No worries about what's on the table UNDER the topper. We've had three restaurant employess (different restaurants) ask about the product for their customers with little ones.",5

"Neat Solutions Sesame Street Table Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Placemats, 20-Count","I finally found these items after searching at every baby retailer I could think of.  They are truly a necessity for every toddler which no Mom should go without!  These toppers are so handy that I never worry over my daughter getting &quot;cooties&quot; from eating out.  They also fold up very thin so you can just slip one in your bag to take with you.  Clean up is really easy, just pull them off &amp; toss.",5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","Its really helpful, hygienic and easy. I really love the design of the drop-ins which perfectly fits the bottle. Really nice. I keep buying it.",5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea",Do exact what they are intended to do. They've never ripped for us and they get warm quicker (breastmilk) than typical plastic bottles. It is easier cleanup using the drop-ins and thus worth the slight extra cost for us.,5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea",I like the fact that when i make a bottle I'm sure it is clean. These liners make going out of the house a lot easier. No need to worry about cleaning the bottles. i just take extra liners and nipples in my bag.,4
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea",I've been using the playtex drop in system since my daughter came home from the hospital and I love it. I have never had a problem with them a must have for new mothers,5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","These are great. They save time and don't leak - like the standard bags sometimes do. HOWEVER I will only buy the generic ones from now on since they are so much cheaper! You can get both sizes at Walgreen's, Walmart and Target. Save your money!",5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","I fed my first child using these drop-ins, and I feel they helped tremendously with reducing gas.  With my second child, less than two years after we stopped using the bottles the first time, Playtex changed their box design, and it appears their liner design.  The liners are longer and randomly my bottles leak!  It happens right around the seal at the top.  At 4 in the morning it really is a pain to have to change a sleepy baby's shirt.I used to recommend these to every one I talked to about feeding, but I can no longer recommend them. Playtex probably wants you to buy whole new bottle sets, but they should state on the box that they won't fit your bottles purchased a few years ago.",2
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea",Love these liners have been using for many years with all my kids . never had a problem with them.,5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","I don't get the purpose of these since the air goes right back in during the feeding(got the special Playtex nipples and bottles). Also, the store brand ones do the same thing for half the price. Walmart ones are not as soft, but do the same thing still",2
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","I have some Dr. B brand bottles. They are awesome. But when I was a first time mom, I hated washing bottles and parts. It didn't take much time, but still it took time. So I switched to Playtex Drop-Ins bottles. Yay! I rinsed tons of nipples and washed them all at once later on the day. Now I have my 2nd child. Playtex Drop-ins is the only one I use.The liners are expendable. It designed for the bottle. It's durable and doesn't have plastic smell like other generic brand I used once.Please note: If you want to use generic brand liners, you fill water to the water lines ON THE LINER instead of the marks on the bottle itself. The water level/volumn is different.",4
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","These are so easy. I don't have to wash a million bottles anymore! I just have to wash the nipples. The only complaint I have is that I pre-fill with water and dump in the formula when I'm ready, but when I put in the 8 oz. and let the bottle sit for a while, the bag expands a little so it only looks like I have 7 oz. So the measurements may be a little off. I would use a measuring cup to make sure you get exactly how much water you want and not rely on the liner's measurements.",4
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","Since these are used for only minutes and then tossed away , and never heatedto a dangerous level, the baby is safe and colic etc . is reduced. Only glass bottles are safer but they do not reduce colic..so I choose theseUsed them on 2 healthy kids and loved them",5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea",these bottle drop ins (I think) are much better than using regular bottles for 2 reasons. 1. you can squeeze all the air out therefore reducing gas in baby's tummy and 2. easy clean up :),4
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea",GREAT would be the word for this purchase! Too bad I could only purchase online from overseas as it is very hard to find this item in where I reside.,5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","Couldn't find this in stores around my area. But I've used this before and they're great. It's convenient and it minimizes the need for a lot of bottles and best part is they're disposables. I never had problems with this drop-in liners before although I did read another review that there's another liner that can be used with the drop-in nurser bottles, just as good if not more effective, cheaper and more count. Regardless, this has my stamp of approval and I would recommend this for new parents.",5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea",I love the drop-ins system.  I used them for my first daughter when I went back to work and my family who watched her loved the convenience of them. I am using them again for my DCP for my second daughter. There is less washing needed during the day as the bottle doesn't get dirty.  I have never had an issue with these and was happy to find them on Amazon!P.S. There is also a system you can buy to pump directly into the bottles.  It was cheap and saves a step!,5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea",The plastic drop in bottles work perfectly well.  I recycle the plastics and I don't have to wash the bottles.,5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea",Seems to help with my son's colic. Be sure to push the air out once the bottle is put together and formula/breast milk is it. Air will flow through the nipple. We used it until he was eating around 6oz a serving.,5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea",Love these bottles! Less air escapes bottle and into baby with the help of the bag plus less clean up!,5

"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","I have no idea why I spent so much money on Avent (leaks all the time and too fast flow) and Dr. Brown's (difficult to clean).  I love this disposable liners because I just discard them after use, which is awesome when you have a baby to take care of.",5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea",These are bottle bags used with Playtex bottles for feeding a baby. These bags are excellent and do the job well. I enjoy shopping on Amazon its the best way to shop!,4

"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","These liners pair with the playtex bottle and are the simplest bottles because you just toss the liner. It came in handy when we found bottles that he gone missing under the couch or entertainment center and appeared weeks later with mold in them...it was no big deal, we just tossed the liner! Also really simple to add some powder formula, roll up and keep in a zip lock already pre-portioned ready to grab and go!",5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","We chose to use the Playtex Nurser Drop-Ins system because of convenience and sanitation. I'm so glad we did! We've been using the 4 ounce liners for 4.5 months now and we have never had one leak or break. They're very easy to use and reduce my time doing dishes. I've used the 8-10 ounce liners a few times as well with no issues. For those curious about measurements, it's very close to the measurement on the Medela bottles I pump into and Nuk bags. Sometimes after pouring milk into the liners they will expand just a tad more once the weight of the milk pushes the crinkles out, but it's not a large amount at all. I've used the 4 oz Up and Up Target brand liners as well, but when these are on sale at Babies R Us they are usually cheaper than buying the generic from Target.",5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","I was prepping bottles and put 5 liners into 5 bottles and one right after the other all 5 started leaking. Those were the only 5 but with how expensive they are I shouldn't have that issue. It also was extreemly frustrating having 5 in a row and milk spilling everywhere. I have since decided to switch bottles, because of the cost and the frustration. I used these with my oldest but I just don't want to deal with buying liners all the time for another 6+ months.",2

"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea",These are great for easy cleanup; especially when you don't have a dishwasher.  You just have to wash the nipple.,5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","I have used the older version of the drop-ins, where you have to fold them over the top of the bottle, and they leaked. I have also used the version of drop-ins that do not expand. Well needless to say this version is their best yet. They don't leak and they hold enough liquid without spilling over the top of the bottle.",5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea",I love the playtex drop in system - it might cost a little more but it's worth it for the ease of bottle prep and knowing that bottles are clean and sanitary every time! These don't tear and warm easily in a cup of hot water.,5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","I love using drop ins, and it is a good choice since you are not supposed to heat up breastmilk.",5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea",Have not had any problems with the Playtex bottle liner drop-ins. Makes life so much easier when you are traveling or don't have a dish washer. Used these with my kids and now my grandkids.,5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","Drop in liners do make bottle cleaning so much less time consuming then before. Too bad Playtex is quite expensive. I tend to go back and forth between these and the store brands. I've found that most store brands work just as well and at a fraction of the cost. However, when I bought them on Amazon this time they were at a descent price plus a $1 off coupon which made the purchase worth it.",4
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","I have been using these for 5 months, since my daughter was born and they are perfect. I have not had any problems with these and they are so much safer and sterile than a plastic bottle. Worth the extra cost to continue to buy these. I think the only thing that could come close to being as good is glass bottles.",5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea",So simple to use for a busy mom who doesn't have time to clean bottles all day long!  I highly recommend the liners and bottles that go with them.,5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","We first discovered these liners two years ago and used them a lot for our son.  They rarely failed, were quick to heat up milk, and were convenient.  Sometime in the past two years, Playtex made their 4 oz liners about half as thick as before, probably to save on materials.  The new thinner liner is causing frequent failures (about one in eight liners have some sort of failure) when the liners are full of milk and heated.  We've bought these liners from Amazon as well as two different retailers and found them all to be too thin.  Oftentimes the liners slip off the thin plastic ring that holds them in place and spill their contents of precious breast milk everywhere.  It's incredibly frustrating to calm down a hungry baby while waiting for the milk to heat up and then have the liner spill all that milk on their clothes and floor.  Our daycare's infant room has noticed that the Playtex liners have become thinner as well, and other parents that use the liners are having the same problem.  Playtex's 8 oz liners are still the same thickness and do not fail very often.  Customers should avoid these thin 4 oz liners and either use a different bottle or wait for the 8 oz liners when their kids get older.",1
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","We use these whenever we are away from home (take up less room in a diaper bag or suitcase) Took her a while to get used to the nipple on the bottle. But she's pretty easy to feed. If there's food in it, she'll figure out how to use it,lol. I am pleased with the price of these, they are more expensive in stores.",5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","I'm a big fan of the playtex drop in system overall.  Since I'm a working Mom, I got a kit so that I can pump directly into the liners.  I'm able to pump into the 4 oz liners with no problem, but the 10 oz liners do not hold their shape and more than once I have been transporting my liner with breast milk home to find it leaking.  I'm really not a fan of the 10oz liner, but I really like the 4oz liner.",3

"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","I have used disposable drop-in liners from multiple stores (Wally-World, the bullseye store, & various drugstores) and find that they all work just as fine as these Playtex ones do, but at half the price.  I like that the Playtex liners are thinner feeling, meaning the liner collapses better inside the bottle when baby is drinking...but even with the others feeling like a thicker plastic, they work as well.  Playtex, come down in price and you'll get 5 stars instead of only 4.",4
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea",This is the most comfortable and convenient product for the parents... I am not sure how different these Playtex ones are compared to the other brands or store brands... I bought these for the first time and I haven't thought of any other brand so far...,5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","I can't complain, these things have saved us so many sleepless nights because of a gassy baby! My first child had a major problem with gas because of the formula he was on, we tried so many different bottles and systems until we came across these. What a lifesaver! The Dr. Brown's bottles do a great job at keeping gas out of baby's stomach but these liners do an even better job! I must say though that I do miss the old design and the expandable liners, I don't know why they changed it but the new design still gets the job done. Now, with our second child these liners are still trumping any bottle feeding system out there. Don't buy the cheaper store brands if you really want your baby gas free, we have tried that and there's a huge difference in them! Will definitely be using these again if we have a 3rd!",5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea",Arrived promptly and was packaged well.I will certainly recommend this feeding system to my friends.My baby is very content with these bottles and liners.,5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","I think this product actually lives up to its name. A few bucks more but you can tell the difference. However, for those that are more economical moms, the &quot;Parents Choice&quot; brand of the pre-formed drop-ins work just as well, so feel free to use that brand with no quality sacrifice!",5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","After a fourth night of having to change my baby's shirt in the middle of the night due to this bottle leaking all over his clothes, i decided enough was enough. At first I couldn't understand why it was leaking, then after careful inspection, realized the liners are the problem with pin holes causing milk to leak. I googled and have read many many complaints of the same since 2008. Seems Playtex shouldn't have changed the liners as it has caused this problem.",1
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","Easy to use.  One drawback is the liners are crashed little bit because they are soft, so it is not accurate if I use the measuring marks on the nurser bottle to measure milk.  I used a measuring cup to measure milk, and then pour it into a liner.",4
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea",My little one had sever tummy issues from the beginning.  She would cry for hours and had tons of gas. The drop ins were recommended to us and it's been a complete 180. She is 6 months old and we still swear by this.  It makes life alot easier as far as bottle cleaning because with each use you just get rid of the insert.,4
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea",These liners are the greatest. We don't have a dishwasher so washing bottles is kind of a pain. These are so much easier to just throw away and not have to worry about it.,5
Medela Breastmilk Storage and Feeding Set,"I love these bottles, granted I don't use all the stuff they come with it, I have my own nipples and rings. But I love the bottles and caps. I use them to freeze and store my breastmilk for daycare and they are sturdy and compact. Also, I just have to defrost them and they are ready to use. That's why I chose not to use bags, they seemed like too much trouble- I would rather pay the extra money and have plenty of bottles. I have been using these bottles since I got home from the hospital and would bottle feed him from time to time. I only gave it 4 stars because I don't use all the accessories, otherwise I would have said 5 stars.",4
Medela Breastmilk Storage and Feeding Set,i use this to store breastmilk so my husband can feed the baby.  i also use the bottles to freeze breastmilk.  its great because its compatible for the medela pump but my baby isnt that fond of the nipples.  i end up using the avent for feeding and transfer the milk from the medela.  buy this if you are planning on storing a lot of milk.  otherwise you are better off with avent or gerber new traditions.,4
Medela Breastmilk Storage and Feeding Set,I bought these for I needed more bottles to store freezer breastmilk. If you are going to use them also for feeding I found the nipples to flow to quickly for my little one. I used a different bottle for feeding and wish I would have gotten nestmom.com website before purchasing as I got their mother milkmate storage system for 27.00. It includes 10 5oz bottles and a handy rack for the freezer keeping oldest milk in front. The 27 also includes shipping - The bottles fit on both medela and ameda breast pumps. It is well worth the money and wish I hadn't bought the medela bottles as they are no longer being used.,2
Medela Breastmilk Storage and Feeding Set,"I like all the Medela products, but this came with a few items that I really didn't need.  On the plus side, the bottles are sturdy, the caps seal tightly, and the whole thing works with the 'pump in style' breast pump I was using.  Also, the nipple-rings are great and work with any brand of nipple you buy.  The bottles are also great for freezing milk.On the negative side, the little discs that go with the nipple rings that they include to create a 'temporary' cap is pretty useless.  I wish they had just provided a few more 'full' caps which provide a better seal.Also, the nipples for all the Medela products were never a favorite with my son, though that might be a personally preference of his.  I just use the Playtex or Evenflo nipples with these bottles, and they work just fine.Last, for some reason, the other caps they provide that are supposed to fit over the nipple & nipple-ring never really fit, so it would often leak out into the diaper bag.Bottom line:  Worth it, I suppose, for the items that work, but ditch the other items as they are not very good.",3
Medela Breastmilk Storage and Feeding Set,"I used this set with the Medela Pump in style for my daughter (now 20 months) and am about to purchase it again for number two. I went back to work when my daughter was 5 months, but breastfed her till she was 11 months, so had lots of experience with the set, which was small convenient, easy to use and interchangeable with other niples and bottles for when she got older.  My only complaint is that I culdn't buy a steam steriliser to accompany the set (as you can with Avent systems) as boiling the bottles every day was a real chore.",4
Medela Breastmilk Storage and Feeding Set,"I was very disappointed in this product. It was highly recommended by the hospital, so I bought TWO sets of these bottles before my baby was born. After breastfeeding for about four or more weeks, I tried to get her to take a bottle and she refused the Medela nipple. We also tried the Avent nipple and she didn't like those, either. We finally ended up with the Playtex Premium. She only needed a small amount of coaxing to take those. Now she's a pro! (Anyone need my Medela set????)",1
Medela Breastmilk Storage and Feeding Set,"i love the pump in style breast pump, i tell everyone to buy it.  but i like gerber's storage bags because they have a ziplock seal.  these bottles are ok, but my 4  month old baby hates bottles, so i havent had much luck with them.",4
Medela Breastmilk Storage and Feeding Set,Just what I wanted.  Perfect additions to my Medela pump.,5
Medela Breastmilk Storage and Feeding Set,"I am exclusively breastfeeding my baby and am pumping extra so her dad can give her a bottle a day.  The bottle size is perfect for newborns and infants under 1 year who are eating primarily at the breast and are just being given a few ounces of supplement size breastmilk or formula.  My daughter prefers the breast, but she latched onto the Medela nipples without a problem, and did not experience any nipple confusion when going for her next feeding at the breast.  The Medela nipples are very closely shaped like the real thing.  Also, I love how the caps can be used for cup feedings, too.If you have a Pump In Style regular or advanced pump, you'll really like how you can pump directly into these bottles.  Plus, it's good to have a few extra bottles that come with this kit, so you don't have to constantly wash the few that came with the pump and always have clean ones on hand.",5
Medela Breastmilk Storage and Feeding Set,I use this to refrigerate after I pump when I know I will be using the milk soon.  It works well for this purpose.,4
Medela Breastmilk Storage and Feeding Set,"The extra bottles and nipples are great for storage. We ended up getting the cheap Gerber bottles with silicone nipples also, and they work just as well.  My 4 mo. old actually prefers the inexpensive nipples. I use both types of bottles for pumping with my Medela Double Select Breastpump. Save some money for diapers!",4
Medela Breastmilk Storage and Feeding Set,"We use this storage and feeding set every day.  We bought other feeding bottles, but having the breastmilk in these bottles for sure creates convenience with great speed.  We use these to store the milk in the freezer and/or fridge, and then whenever baby is hungry daddy or/and sitter simply attaches the nipple and cap, places bottle in bottle-warmer and - voila - it's all ready in a matter of a few mins.  No fuss transferring milk from freezer bags into bottles.  Also, because nipple is on the bottle when bottle placed in the warmer, the nipple gets all warm and supple, which our baby prefers (rather than having a cold/harder nipple).",5
Medela Breastmilk Storage and Feeding Set,"I like that the caps seal well, the bottles fit in the ice pack that comes with the pump in style advanced breast pump.  When my baby was ready for a faster flow nipple, however, I have been unable to find them (my guess is that Medela doesn't make them). So now my little boy is used to these Medela slow flow nipples but I have to get him used to something else now that he is getting bigger.  Ah well.  I am still happy with my purchase.",4
Medela Breastmilk Storage and Feeding Set,The bottles are the perfect size for one feeding. My newborn loves the nipples on those bottles and he cries when I tried to give him a different bottle. Works great with the medela pumps and is perfect for storage. It is one of the few bottles out there that is BPA free.,5
Medela Breastmilk Storage and Feeding Set,"Don't bother with these.  They are expensive for only 4 bottles and totally unnecessary.  It is much easier to buy storage bags.  If you are pumping full time, you will be storing alot more than 4 bottles at a time. I also found that I did not like these bottles for feeding because they do nothing to prevent air from entering baby's belly and the result is gas or worse, colic.They also flow too fast for newborns.",2
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"This is the best 20.00 that I have ever spent.  I am 6 months pregnant and have had horrible lower back pains.  I was sleeping with a mountain of pillows and hot pads and I was having the most awful time sleeping.  I read the reviews for this product and it was so inexpensive, thought maybe it was too good to be true.  It does take a bit of getting used to at first.  But I have no back pain at all when I sleep.  I don't even need a heating pad.  You'll have to find the right place to sleep with it.  And I agree with the other reviews, it would be nice if it was wider.  Don't waste your money on the fancy pregnancy pillows, this is where it is at!",5
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"The DEX Pillow is great.  I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and I am 21 weeks along.  The pillow is not overly big and fits nicely under the belly.  I tried the fully body boppy pillow, but had trouble sleeping with it and I had trouble with having to adjust it again after turning over.  This pillow is easy to change sides with.  Before pregnancy I slept on my belly.  I find that this pillow has really helped me transition from being a belly sleeper to a side sleeper.",5
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"at ten bucks it's so cheap I thought it'd be worth a try, and it's teeny compared to the body pillow I've been using- but ouch!!! it's like putting a triangular shaped brick under my hip.  I didn't think sleeping in the third trimester could get any LESS comfortable ... until I purchased this atrocity.",1
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,GOOD PRODUCT,4
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"I read all the bad reviews and bought it anyway. Why? I was looking for a nice compact wedge to put on my lap when I read heavy or oversized books in bed. This is perfect! Just the right size and slant, and just what I wanted! For those not happy with it for its intended purpose, there still is good use for it if you like to read in bed.",5
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,I love this pillow while I was pregnant! I could not sleep without it. It provided my belly support and I also used it when traveling on planes to give me some back support. This pillow helped me get more hours of sleep. Highly recommend.,5

DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"It's not designed to sit on it, so it cannot take it much. A little too soft. But worth to buy",3
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"Like trying to lay on a cardboard box, I guess that's what I get for going the cheap way out!",1
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,This is a great pillow that allows me to be more comfortable at night.  Because of it's shape it isn't too big or small.  The reason it did not get 5 stars is that the skinny edge looses it's shapea little.  I'm sure it is because I ""shove"" it under my belly 100 times a night.,4
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"I loathe sleeping on my side and this pillow is the only thing that makes it bearable. I tried those big body pillows but they were complete overkill. Not only were they too soft but they were entirely too large and cumbersome for our queen-sized bed. My husband said it was like having three people in the bed. This pillow, however, is small and effective. It takes the load off my belly and hips. My pelvic bones are separating and this pillow really gives me relief. As an added bonus, I don't have to spend five minutes unentangling myself from a monster pillow (while trying not to wake my husband) every two hours to go to the bathroom.",4
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,My gift was a hit and the family member due couldn't wait to try it out. I'm glad everyone was happy!!,5
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"I have found it very useful. It's small and not too puffed up. I put it under the left side of my belly to sleep and it's worked out great. When I wake up it's still where I had placed it. Other big pillows fall on the floor or move somewhere else while you're asleep. For your knees you need something more padded, this one is very comfortable for one side of your growing belly. It brings support without making you feel too trapped.Hope it helps.Jhan",5
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"I was looking for a sleeping wedge for gastric acid. This was good price ,but did not have product size. So I made a mistake. Guess it is good for what it says it is.",1
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"I so love this pillow, I bought it yesterday on a desperate whim.. I hadn't read the reviews but after weeks of terrible sleep and moaning and groaning, anything would be a miracle. So I'm proud to report that last night, at 29 weeks pregnant, I slept through the night, with the exception of my bathroom runs.. I feel better this morning then I have in DAYS!",5
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,My wife simply loves this pillow after having a major abdominal surgery. She found it to be comfortable and supportive while lying on her side.,5
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"I purchased this product late in my third trimester. It was so inexpensive and I was having so much trouble sleeping that I knew I didn't have anything to lose in trying it.  I didn't think it would do much, but this little wedge has done WONDERS for me!  I went from tossing and turning uncomfortably all night to sleeping soundly almost all night (except having to get up to pee!)  I use it under my belly, which allows me to finally get comfortable on my side. I am a back/belly sleeper normally and could never figure out how to make side sleeping work. I also wedge it behind my back if I find myself rolling onto my back a lot--it keeps me from rolling over. This pillow has worked way better for me than putting pillows between my legs, and way better than a body pillow.  Another reviewer mentioned that this helped her with pelvic pain, and it did the same for me! No more excruciating pains when I get out of bed, and much better throughout the day!I can't recommend this product enough, and only wish I had purchased it sooner! Really, what do you have to lose at this price? It's worth a try.",5
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,,1
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,I tried to use this while pregnant but for me it was too thick and firm.  However it did make a great tool for propping up our newborn's mattress because he needs to sleep elevated due to reflux.,2
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,I love this pillow. It is just enough to level off my stomach and keep it from hanging to the side while I sleep. A must have for last few months.,5
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,This pillow is super tiny and a big disappointment.It does not provide adequate support or relief from the discomforts of pregnancy. I feel like I was mislead and I wasted my money.,1
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,I expected a large wedge I wasn't expecting such a small wedgeI should have paid more attention to the measurement,1
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,I bought this wedge pillow in my third trimester and used it for 3 nights and will now be returning it.  I bought it due to back pain while sleeping.  My back pain was definitely worse after the 3 nights I used this pillow.,1
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"Such a small little item that can change the whole outlook of your pregnancy, through better sleep.  I purchased this pillow with my first pregnancy in 1997 and quickly discovered what a tiny ""must-have"" that no pregnant woman should be without.  I had tried regular pillows, 'body' pillows and other, more expensive 'sleep' pillows, to no avail.  They are too bulky under the tummy and make it feel 'crammed' instead of 'supported'. This graduated wedge is all you need to support your growing tummy at night, because you can adjust how much support you want with it by putting it closer or farther away from your belly.I am 8 months into my third pregnancy (I did purchase a new one for this pregnancy, but not because my old one 'wore out', I think I gave it away) and would not sleep a night without it!  A Pregnancy MUST-HAVE!!",5
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"I bought this when I was about 20 weeks pregnant and trying to force myself to lie on my side, which was very uncomfortable for me and not my preferred sleeping position.  A lot of friends recommended the snoogle pillow, but I didn't want something so expensive -- or so cumbersome in my bed.  This has been perfect.  It's not very big or intrusive, and it does the job well.  I am sleeping much, much better.  I love using it as suggested to offer support under my belly when sleeping on my side.  Depending on the angle I use it, I can lie more toward my stomach or entirely on my side.  Either way, all I need is one more pillow between my legs and I am comfortable for a long night's sleep.  I also sometimes find it helpful to nap with it under my lower back to place me at a slight angle but still essentially on my back when I'm having some hip or back pain.  I'm not sure how much longer that will be comfortable, but I love it for now.  Definitely give this a try and see if it will suit before you going with something bigger and more expensive.",5
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,I bought a wedge shaped pillow other brand though and it was the best pregnancy purchase I made. For the belly or back it was for me essential from week 27 and after the delivery also perfect for support. I had a c section and it got the belly off the wound so I could sleep. Perfect for the back for the airplane.,5
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"After reading the reviews, I decided this was just what I was looking for.  A lot of reviews said it was rather small and hard. It is.  And that is what I wanted. I can move it with me in our queen sized bed everytime I turn over.  The movement generally doesn't wake or disturb my partner because of the smaller size.  I wanted something harder to actually support my rather large belly and it does that.  It's inexpensive and arrived quickly. I recommend this pillow!",5
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"I started using this pillow around the 4-5th month of pregnancy because my back would hurt as my stomach hung over while I slept on my side.  This gave the support that allowed my stomach to not pull down on my back, which made me very comfortable.  I continued to use it through out my pregnancy and it really helped.  What was wonderful about it is that it gave support, but it still left room for my husband in bed!  The only thing that kept it from being 5 stars is that by the 9th month, the narrow end of the pillow began to flatten and slightly curl, but not enough to make it uncomfortable if I remembered to flip it over each night.",4
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"This pillow is great, its nice and small enough to fit with my husband in the bed.  You can use it under your belly, but I also use it to put under my back since you can't lay flat.  My only complaint is that I haven't had it too long, but it already looks like its getting smashed at the bottom - I wish it was made of a firmer material so it would last longer.  Can't beat it for the price though!",4
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"I'm 28 weeks pregnant, and have been having trouble sleeping with the extra tummy weight so I thought this would help.  However, this didn't really help me sleep better at all, if anything it made it worse.  It was very uncomfortable.  Maybe I'll try it again later when my tummy gets even bigger.***UPDATE***  Now that I am 33 weeks, I use this support pillow every night.  Once my tummy got bigger, the pillow was no longer uncomfortable and actually helps support my belly very much.  Now I can't sleep without it!",4
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"I have to pipe in here with 5 stars!  I was a stomach sleeper before becoming prego and was having a horrible, miserable time trying to fall alseep besides getting comfortable enough to do so.  Then I would wake up becasue my back hurt or I was on my back!  My friend said that she had a ""wedgie"" pillow and she was going to loan it to me!  Thank goodness I took her up on it!  Do give it a few days to get use to it but I'll tell you- the moment I tucked that pillow between my belly and the bed- I was a HAPPY camper!  It is like you are sleeping on your tummy.  I then put a normal pillow between my legs and I'm off to dreamland.  The pressure is taken off of you back and stomach as you can 'lean' into the Wedge. I'm 30 weeks pregnant and have been using it for 3 weeks and couldn't be happier.  Treat yourself and get this pillow!  Wish I would have found it earlier!!!!",5
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"I bought this pillow when I was about 4 months pregnant because my back was starting to hurt. This has been a life saver! We have a queen bed, and this doesn't get in the hubby's way at night. It is not very big, but I don't like the big pillows. This one is just right. I have been using it for almost 4 months now and wouldn't give it up for anything.",5
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,This pillow does help when your belly feels heavy and pulls when you are trying to rest on your side.  I have trouble sleeping with it for some reason although the bigger I get the more helpful it is. I need more support than just for the belly so I have preferred sleeping with a body pillow.  I was a bit disappointed with how small it is.  I was hoping that it would be wider so that I could use it to sleep off center on my back as well.  But it is helpful and every bit of help makes a difference!,4
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"A decent pillow, wife is expecting and is in her 6th month, and this was perfect gift to her for a good night sleep.",4
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,Just my personal opinion. This is too hard to use as a pregnancy pillow to put between your belly and matress. It's not comfortable.,2
Evenflo Position and Lock Tall Wood Mount Gate,"Be warned, the product description says it expands from 26&#34; to 42&#34; but that is not true - the box it came in says 31&#34; to 50&#34;.  My doorway is 29&#34; wide and I had to force it in so much so that it is bowing the gate's frame.  Other than the size being wrong, it's a decent gate.  I'm am using it as a pet gate for cats and it seems pretty sturdy for that.",3
Evenflo Position and Lock Tall Wood Mount Gate,The third time I went to latch this gate in to place it busted in two. I was very disappointed and should really send it back.,1
Evenflo Position and Lock Tall Wood Mount Gate,I was using this gate in several doorways and the bottom of some stairs and I guess since I kept adjusting the bar so much it just snapped off. I guess you get what you pay for. Sadly I only had this for a month before it broke.,2
Evenflo Position and Lock Tall Wood Mount Gate,"My 8 month old was strong enough to pull this down, even when I had it adjusted so tight the center beam was bowing. It doesn't have a way to adjust or tighten the gate after setting it between walls or in a doorway, so you have to guess at the adjustment and then try to shove it in place. Not fun.The wood is also pretty light and flimsy, and I don't trust it.",1
Evenflo Position and Lock Tall Wood Mount Gate,"I ordered this gate from Target Direct, and not only wasit perfect for keeping my 2.5 yr old son out of places heshouldn't be, it also keeps our standard poodle out of thekitchen! We have an irreular space between our living room and kitchen and all the other gates were never big or tall enough!Awesome product at a awesome price! Thanks!",5
Evenflo Position and Lock Tall Wood Mount Gate,"This was purchased specifically for keeping our two dogs in or out of rooms. Works perfectly in this capacity, very versatile: narrow enough for standard doors and can go wide enough for hallways, most places you'd think of using it. Four rubber ""feet"" on each side provide a decent amount of protection for surfaces, and compress enough to make for a very snug fit; the gate doesn't need to be touch the ground and will stay place very securely.",5
Evenflo Position and Lock Tall Wood Mount Gate,"These expandible gates work fine. The first one we bought years ago was made here in America. We use them to keep our dogs out of rooms and need something that is easily removable and fits different size doorways. They aren't great to look at, but they work. We like the expanding feature and the fact that the rubber stops keep the gates from marring up the walls.Our only BIG regret is that they are now made overseas and there is nothing like this made in America.Dude, we're tired of having EVERYTHING made somewhere else while friends and neighbors can't find work! Well, whenever we can, we buy AMERICAN.",3
Evenflo Position and Lock Tall Wood Mount Gate,"I had a difficult time finding a gate that would be tall enough, wide enough and affordable for my home. I found this one a a local BabiesRUs and decided to give it a shot. When I got home, I took it out of the box and put it right up. Perfect! I am going back to buy 2 more.",5
Evenflo Position and Lock Tall Wood Mount Gate,"We have a four year old, two year old and a newborn, and have purchased several of these Evenflo gates over the last 4 years.  With the arrival of our third child I ordered a new Evenflo gate. What a disappointment in comparison to the other ""identical"" Evenflo gates we already own. The quality has really gone down hill; cheaper components from top to bottom (wire mesh, the thickness of the frame, and the way the cross bar is attached to the upright bars).  Within 2 minutes of being out of the box I was shaking my head and putting it back in the box to be returned.  If the quality had been the same as earlier versions I would have given the product 4 stars, as it really did what it was designed to do and the price was right.  This is my first review of any product on Amazon, and I've purchased hundreds of items since the site opened.  Evenflo should really be ashamed of the way they lessened the quality of this specific product. The first thought that came to my mind is they outsourced to the lowest cost bidder - and it shows.",1
Prince Lionheart Crib Rail Protector,"Wish I'd read the Amazon reviews before trekking down to BRU and buying these.  Everything posted here is true:  they don't fit my VERY standard crib rail, look like they'd easily pry off even if they did, and -whew!- the plasticky odor makes me wonder how safe it would be for baby to be knawing on them all the time.  They're going back!!I guess these would probably fit a portable crib with a small rail, but I can't recommend them for anything else, if you can get them to work at all.",1
Prince Lionheart Crib Rail Protector,"One day, we woke up and realized that our child was now a wood chuck.  I promptly bought these to save the crib.  They are doing the job, he is not able to chew on the crib anymore, but they are very easily removed.  We had to use all 4 (one package) end to end to cover one side of the crib rail.  I'm hoping he stops chewing soon, or we will have to get something else, because he will soon have it figured out how to pull them off.",3
Prince Lionheart Crib Rail Protector,Our toddler pulls each one of the four rail protectors and throws them out of the way so he can chow down on wood and varnish.  What a waste of our money.  Now we are looking for other options.....perhaps something that stays on the rail!,1
Prince Lionheart Crib Rail Protector,I returned these items as they popped off the rails and would not stay on.  They do not fit all cribs.,1
Prince Lionheart Crib Rail Protector,"We got these as a quick and easy way to discourage chewing on the crib (front rail). It seemed to work well and now that our daughter turned 2 years old, I thought I could remove them (I mistakingly thought she had outgrown chewing on her crib). After being in place for almost 10 months, these things were adhered to the crib. With much prying and cursing and broken finger nails I was able to remove them . . . along with the stain from the crib. Everyplace that the rubber rail covers were in direct contact with the crib, there is now an ugly, uneven, unstained area. We have a cherry stained Munire convertible crib. The places where the covers were all feel sticky and no amount of furniture polish will get it off.To add insult to injury, now that the teething covers are removed, my daughter is chewing on the crib again. However, the places where the stain is sticky, it can be scraped off so now she has stain all over her teeth and under her finger nails.I just purchasedTrend-Lab Crib Wrap Rail Guard for Long Rail, Brown Fleeceand it works much better. I also don't need to worry about a fabric cover softening and destroying the finish of our nice crib. I am very disappointed - perhaps there is a warning in the directions that I didn't read (thought they looked pretty self-explanatory). Now I have lost the stain in parts from teeth marks and also from the teething covers. I honestly don't know if the problem is with the composition of the plastic/rubber covers or a problem with how the stain was prepared and applied.We covered the side rails withKidkusion Gummi Crib Rail. This rubber did not remove any stain after being on for 10 months except where the adhesive was placed - which is not visible as it is on the underside of the rail. Now I need to figure out how to repair this damage so it doesn't look so awful . . . after we are POSITIVE our daughter is done with the beaver impressions.",1
Prince Lionheart Crib Rail Protector,"Study and suitable for the application. However, does not fit securely. Has a tendency to lift. Also the rail protector is in four pieces instead of one. For the price it is adequate.",4
Prince Lionheart Crib Rail Protector,"These are great, but not for the purpose intended.  I used them to cover & protect the wooden rungs on my counter height chairs or stools.  I had tried, on the internet, to find chair rail covers.  There were none that were adequate.  I highly recommend these for protecting wooden chair rungs from shoes during use.",5
Prince Lionheart Crib Rail Protector,I am really surprised to read other negative reviews on this product.  I used it for my first son and I am now buying new ones to use with my second son.  My son was never able to remove these and they fit snugly on our Carters crib.  I would definitely recommend - maybe these just depends on the shape of the crib.,5
Prince Lionheart Crib Rail Protector,"My toddler figured out how to take this off and it was great entertainment for him. Each time he didn't want to go down for a nap, these were 4 more items he could toss from the crib to show his discontent.We just got the rubber/gummy teether that attaches with adhesive strips, hopefully this will provide more protection for the already chewed on rail.",1
Prince Lionheart Crib Rail Protector,"I've had the same problems as some other reviewers - did not fit the side rails where my 10 month old chews, and even when put on the front rail where they appeared to fit fine, they are easily removed by the baby.Since they don't fit the sides where she chews, I don't really know how they hold up against teething babies.  It's my fault that I didn't measure before I bought, so that's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 or 2.And as for suggestions on securing the teether with zip ties, that seems like it could be something else for the baby to chew on and hurt herself on.  I'd prefer not to have to do something like that.",3
Prince Lionheart Crib Rail Protector,"Sometimes baby pulls them off and they become a naptime distraction, but hey.... They're keeping her from chewing up the crib! Stay on our Graco Lauren crib well (don't just fall off with a slight touch like some do).",4
Prince Lionheart Crib Rail Protector,"I found this product online with a higher price than regular stores, this was the best offer for the same product, I already used it and it is perfect to cover baby's crib and it doesn't disturb room decoration. The only thing that you have to know is that 1 package only covers one side of the crib. Thank you for this great offer",5
Prince Lionheart Crib Rail Protector,"I should have heeded other reviews about this product.  I love this company, and wanted something that wasn't cloth and soaked with flame retardants.  The rails do come in 4 pieces and easily are taken off by my 11 month old and tossed on the floor.  Then he proceeds to chew on the wood railing anyways.",1
Prince Lionheart Crib Rail Protector,These work great except the children can pull them off easily - so I had to tie strap mine to the baby bed but that worked fine after that.,5
Prince Lionheart Crib Rail Protector,this is just the perfect product i was looking for and works perfect on protecting the wood on the crib rail....,5
Prince Lionheart Crib Rail Protector,Bought these for our grandson's crib to protect him from bumping his mouth or teeth. I think they work great.,4
Prince Lionheart Crib Rail Protector,We bought this product because it was the only one we could find. We have been using it for several months and it has worked great!! Would recommend this product!,5
100% Cotton Terry Contour Changing Pad Cover - Lavender,"With our first baby, we didn't get the countoured pad and covers.  We thought it was frivolous and unnecessary.  For our second baby, we received a generous Babies R Us gift card and went to buy all the things we always felt would have been nice the first time.  The countoured pad and covers was really nice to have.  It makes the whole experience feel a little cozier.  You definitely need to get a couple covers, though so you can have one in the wash and one on the pad.",4
100% Cotton Terry Contour Changing Pad Cover - Lavender,"I love how soft and cuddly this changing pad cover is.  I also appreciate how many colors it comes in.What I am disappointed with is the durability.  I have 3 of these and have used them for just over a year.  They are totally falling apart at the elastic. Now, keep in mind that we use disposable ""chucks"" (those blue hospital disposable under pads) on top of this terry cloth changing pad.  It makes it less messy (especially early on) and doesn't require washing as much.  I also washed them in cold water with Baby Dreft detergent, hung them to dry and rotated the 3 covers that we have.While it is a nice product while it lasts, I just expected them to be more durable.",2
100% Cotton Terry Contour Changing Pad Cover - Lavender,"this item fits the pad well and has held up! To protect the cover and reduce the number of times I wash it I purchased blue absorbant medical pads (the kind they use at the pediatrician's office), take 2 and lay it between my baby and the pad, that way if there are any &quot;accidents&quot; when the diaper is removed the &quot;accident&quot; goes onto the absorbant blue pad, then just wipe your baby and toss the blue pad and the 2nd clean pad is underneath and nothing gets on the pad cover!!Love the color!!",5
100% Cotton Terry Contour Changing Pad Cover - Lavender,I am not really impressed with the fabric. It's not soft terry cloth it's cheap terry cloth but for $12.99 I guess I hoped for more. It'll get the job done but I love the chenille fabric better it's soft on my baby's little butt and I'd rather lay her on it than the terry cloth. I do like the variety of colors that the terry cover has to offer.,2
100% Cotton Terry Contour Changing Pad Cover - Lavender,"This is a great cover. I am less than enthralled that the pad barely fits my table, but this cover makes up for it. The purple is AWESOME. It matches the Lemonade Diaper stacker and the PBK Maggies Garden set perfectly. And the terry is so soft and washes up really well. I got two and I don't think I'll ever have to buy another!",5
100% Cotton Terry Contour Changing Pad Cover - Lavender,"I love these covers.  Bought several 18 months ago when my son was born and just recently purchased some other colors when my daughter was born.  They last through multiple washing, don't fade, or shrink.  They will have some strings that will start to unravel, but it is no different than a terry towel.  Tried other covers, this one is much stronger and has significantly deeper side pockets.  The colors are great too.  Definately recommend.",5
"BabyShade&reg; Stroller Cover Protects Infants in Canopied Strollers from Sun, Rain, Wind and Flying Insects","I used it for the first time today and it did not hold up against the wind. The velcro stickers that came with it came right off. They should be stitched on, or better yet, have velcro straps that are more secure.  It did keep the water out when it wasn't flying up, making my baby cold.  The sun shade part is good and water resistant too but since it is a flap that snaps on, it doesn't stay closed at the seams all the time and wind gets in through there.  Basically, it is not good for windy days unless you alter it yourself by adding your own straps.  I'd rather use it in the warmer months when it is not so windy for the rain and sun shade as well as the neat flying insect net that is under the sun shade.  I'll see how it holds up then.",3
Delta Children's Products Jenny Lind Changing Table in White,"I purchased this changing table in the summer of 2002 (my baby was due in Sept) I put it together very easily by myself. When I read the directions I was disappointed when it said to only use this table for babies up to 20lbs (I was having a 10lb baby) so I didn't think I would get much use. I couldn't afford a more expensive one so I kept it. My son is now 2 1/2 yrs. old and weighs 35lbs and we are still using it!!!! Yes, the middle shelf has a little sag in it (very little) but other than that it's perfect!!! I am so suprised by how sturdy this is!!! After reading some other reviews, I can't believe how many other people don't like it. I'm using it till it can't support my son anymore and gives out but no problems yet. I store toys and diapers on the other shelves. I would highly recommended this table and it's so affordable too :-)",5
Delta Children's Products Jenny Lind Changing Table in White,"I thought that this was a cute, old fashioned changing table when I purchased this product.  The reason this changing table is inexpensive is becaue it is CHEAP and poorly made.  Unfortunately when putting it together several of the pieces cracked and split.  We had to order new pieces.  When the replacement pieces came they were different from the original ones and required different hardware.  The hardware was not sent with the new pieces so we had to go out and buy what we needed from a hardware store.  When it was finally completed it was not very sturdy so I am going out to look for a new changing table.  This was a very poor purchasing decision.  I reccommend spending a little more and getting something that won't fall apart!",1
Delta Children's Products Jenny Lind Changing Table in White,"I put this table together when I was 8 1/2 months pregnant and it was EASY. The instructions were simple and the product was sturdy. I put three wicker baskets on each of the two lower shelves for my diapering products and my baby's linens. My baby is now 20 pounds and is in the 45 percentile for weight and he is 10 months old. The table at this point still holds him. So a 4 month old baby already weighing in at 20 pounds is far from the norm. I bought this table at Babies R Us and have been happy with it every since. The crib is what really caught my attention. The cost was $100 and was ranked high on Consumer Reports. I did not want to spend a fortune on baby furniture. I know it won't be something that my son will use for much more than 2 years. Then I can buy a great toddler bed for $200 and not have to worry about converting a crib. This Delta Jenny Lind love collection makes a great nursery. Plus if it is your first child, chances are you will want the crib to use again for a second child and then the fact that the other crib converts will not be of an importance anymore. You will have a great toddler bed and a great crib for the price of one of the convertible cribs. All of these items are worth the money. Don't let some instances of bad luck turn you away from this product. I could have easily afforded the other changing tables. I just didn't think it was necessary to spend that much money. This one works great and you get to keep a LOT in your wallet. Babies are expensive. There will soon be another good use for the money. Like a new swing set!",5
Delta Children's Products Jenny Lind Changing Table in White,"I thought this changing table was a peice of crap!  Yes, it is a great price but after putting it together, I had problems with the boards falling through instead of staying in the little grooves (which leads to baby falling through risk).  The screws had to be tightened up just about once a week.  I was just overall extremely unsatisfied with this product!  I am expecting again and will but a more expensive changing table this time instead of wasting money on one I can't use.",1
Delta Children's Products Jenny Lind Changing Table in White,"I bought this at a second hand store (...).  It looks just like the one in the picture and was built pretty sturdy.  I hadn't intended to use it;  just wanted to fill an empty space in the nursery with something common.  The minute I put it in the nursery I knew I had to test it out, and it was a good find!  I probably wouldn't have paid (...)for it simply b/c I didn't buy it to use it.  But, now, I intend on using it, and recommend it to others as a wonderful open style dressing table.  It's sturdy, pretty, comes with a pad, has a belt for baby attached, has a lot of baby room on the table, and has lot's of storage space underneath.  It also looks good with most cribs, if you're afraid of mismatching.",4
Delta Children's Products Jenny Lind Changing Table in White,"I love this changing table.  When assembled correctly it is very sturdy and safe.  My son is now 14 months old, and I still use it (with a steady hand on him though!).  I had considered buying a more expensive changing tower, but now from experience I know I don't want to be reaching in doors and drawers to get what I need, it is handier in this open unit.  I would reccomend this table to anyone.  I don't see anything cheap about it, if you use it for what it is intended, (diaper storage, supplies, blankets, etc.), it is perfect.",5
Delta Children's Products Jenny Lind Changing Table in White,"Others seem to have had a much better experience with this item, and we can't understand why.  When assembling the table, it quickly became clear that it was poorly made and the components were badly engineered.  For example, one of the bars would not accept the screw that the manufacturer provided for it - the screw would not bite.  The dowels were not well sanded and seemed as if they could cause splinters.  We decided it wasn't worth continuing the assembly and returned it.  Also note, the shelves are made of a very thin composite wood and are flimsy.  This thing is overpriced and unsafe.",1
Delta Children's Products Jenny Lind Changing Table in White,"We just bought this and think it's so cute!  Also, it is very sturdy for the price you pay.  We just bought this until we decide what kind of dresser we want once she gets bigger.  I would recommend this to anyone!  :)",4
Mommy's Helper Power Strip Safety Cover,I realized that there was a DC-10 power cord (bulky) on my power strip and wondered if this would be able to fit it. This didn't register until after I had bought the cover. When it arrived I was pleased to find that it was big enough. My boy is only 10 months and has yet to get his little hands on it. I'm confident he will be unable to open this if he finds a cord and follows it back to the power.,5
Mommy's Helper Power Strip Safety Cover,This does what it is supposed to do - keeps my daughters fingers out of the extra outlets in the power strip.  That's a win in my book.,5
Mommy's Helper Power Strip Safety Cover,A lot of my chargers are not normal skinny plugs. My cell phone charger has a fat head with the cord coming down side.  My ipad charger has the big usb box part of it that I plug the usb cord into.  Other gadgets have other weird plug heads too.  But all the weird plug heads still fit on my power strip.  This cover does not accommodate those different plug heads on a power strip because it's too narrow and shallow.  Only basic appliance plugs (like a lamp) will fit in this.,3
Mommy's Helper Power Strip Safety Cover,"Actually bought this for my cat, she is 6 months old and loves to chew on stuff.  This is nice that she can't get to the plugs or the extension cord. This would not preclude her from chewing on the cords, but at least they are less accessible.",5
Mommy's Helper Power Strip Safety Cover,"The locking tabs just aren't that great, functionally.  While they do work, its hard to open and close, and it doesnt leave enough room for some of my larger plugs.  again, great concept, needs a bit more on the execution part.",3
Mommy's Helper Power Strip Safety Cover,"I purchased this for an exposed power strip in my husbands office. Our daughter always heads straight under his desk to all the cords and outlet. This cover does the job perfectly! It is large enough to fit the bigger plugs including cellphone chargers under the lid. It is not extremely difficult to open to an older child may be able to figure it out, but it is perfect for us at the moment.",5
Mommy's Helper Power Strip Safety Cover,"These covers are awful, over sized and poorly made.  My 7 month old and 3 year old both can open the latches on these in seconds.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!  safety first has one a bit more expensive but it actually works.",1
Mommy's Helper Power Strip Safety Cover,"This is a must have for parents! What baby doesn't head straight for the power strip? It is easy to use, plesant on the eyes (it is white, not off white like the photo) and IMPOSSIBLE for babies to open!",5
Mommy's Helper Power Strip Safety Cover,it is a good product but i do not like the bulkiness and it is an eye sore.. but it does work effectively.,5
Mommy's Helper Power Strip Safety Cover,"I have one power strip this doesn't fit, but I bought a few and it suits the other ones just fine. Check the dimensions before assuming this will work on your strip. Other than that, it's very secure.",3
Mommy's Helper Power Strip Safety Cover,Nice item to have to keep little fingers from getting shocked. good deal worth the $$ and the feeling of a little peace of mind,5
Mommy's Helper Power Strip Safety Cover,it is ridiculous! all my cords are still sticking out and the unit will not close.  I do not suggest this.,1
Mommy's Helper Power Strip Safety Cover,"I bought this for the price. It ended up being too small for my power strip. It was the sides that have prongs on mine that didn't allow it to fit. If yours has that then they will not fit in here. Looking at it, the strip you need should be slender and one length. (2 inches or so) It looks to be for a smaller one, but it does hold up and is very hard to open for a child. Comes with a few little hardware pieces inside.",4
Mommy's Helper Power Strip Safety Cover,"This is a very useless item.  It doesn't protect children from sticking their fingers inside the cover.  This is easily done even by myself through the top where the cords are supposed to come out.  A child can easily unplug anything inside the cover and get their fingers inside, which completely defeats it's purpose.",2
Mommy's Helper Power Strip Safety Cover,"We use it all over our house. It actually makes our cords look very neat. But before you buy it, please beware of the dimensions of the product (see in product descriptions). It fits all our single-row surge protectors, and even a double-row extention cord with timer. it fits most of our plugs with transformer, EXCEPT some of the bigger ones. Unfortunately, the transformers for our router and DSL modem are too big to fit in, so we still have to find another solution for those...",4
Mommy's Helper Power Strip Safety Cover,"I bought this white cover (model 40896, UPC 3676840896, code on label X0000DM4BB) andSafety 1st Power Strip Coverto compare the two.  Unlike that item, this cover is not expandable.  Its dimensions are fixed at 14"" length, 2-3/4"" wide, and 3-1/4"" high (except for the 4"" at the power strip cord end which is only 1-3/4"" high).  The slot where the cords for the equipment come out is 1/2"" wide and 7-5/8"" long. When closed, the hole for the power strip cord is 1-1/8"" by 1-1/2"".  There are no holes for wall mounting, but four outlet covers, two plastic cable ties, and ten cord identifier stickers are provided.To open the 4"" cover at the power strip cord end, you pull up on a single tab; this seems rather easy for a child to disengage, which means that he/she might have access to the outlet nearest the power strip cord end.  To open the main cover, you pry open three tabs, then open the unit like a clamshell.The plastic is softer but probably more resistant to breakage compared with the Safety 1st model.  I like the fact that you can simply open the 4"" cover to flick the power strip switch on and off.  It is narrower and shorter than the Safety 1st model by about 3/4"" in either direction, which may prevent using wider strips or transformers more than about 1-1/2"" high with it.Buy this from Amazon.com!  (BTW, about the Amazon photo, the interior is actually white, I don't know what produced that egg-yolk-yellow color inside.)",4
Mommy's Helper Power Strip Safety Cover,"For a piece of plastic, it does a good job.  It is hard to open (that's the point) but the power on and off switch is easily accesible, which seems a good safety precaution.  It comes with three little outlet covers, and a couple of useful plastic ties for the cords.  the only problem i have with it so far, is the surge protector i am using is too small, and the first plug is exposed in the on/off switch compartment that is easy to open.  it is still better than nothing, but like with all kids safety products, parents are never replaced.",5
Mommy's Helper Power Strip Safety Cover,"I think this is a great outlet strip cover.  I almost wish I had this before I had kids because it conceals it so nicely and makes the strip look much more tidy.  It's somewhat hard to snap and unsnap together. But that's the point, right?  I would recommend this to anyone looking to either conceal their outlet strips or babyproof their home.",5
"Parent Units TV Guard Original Plastic Shield, Clear, 18 in.","This shield is made of very bendable plastic.  It sits on the shelf in front of the stereo receiver.  Unfortunately it's only about 4 inches high, and when my son pulls on it, it just bends right down and doesn't stop him from turning knobs and pressing buttons for even 1 second.  Not a useful item in my opinion.",1
"Parent Units TV Guard Original Plastic Shield, Clear, 18 in.",I will rate this as a 5 this is a great product i used it with my son and daughter they love to push the buttons but this put a stop to it when they saw me put it in they immidietly went to go push the buttons found out they counld't so they ended up leaving it alone and finding another toy to play with,5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"When I had my daughter I planned to boil everything and didn't even look into sterilizers. What a mistake! When you're pumping, using bottles, and have a baby who likes her binkies, you're in for a lot of washing and boiling. Not only is it time-consuming, but you can't just pop it in the microwave and walk away like with this sterilizer. You have to either set a time or stay close by...I've got the melted, burned up pacifiers to prove it! It was easy to say, ""Oh, this nipple's been through the dishwasher, it's sterile enough."" But soon my baby had thrush, and I had to either pump or use formula.I was boiling like a maniac trying to keep the thrush at bay. Finally I got this sterilizer, but that was long after I'd had to give up breastfeeding and we were close to using sippy cups. This sterilizer is so easy to use and gave me such peace of mind. I wish I had invested in it before I even had my baby...but I know that when I have another I'll be sterilizing everything! I'm looking forward to just moving everything straight from the dishwasher into the microwave and walking away. No more boiling water for us!",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"We have a dishwasher and had a full term very healthy child, and still used this product. Lids and nipples tend to turn up in the dishwasher and retain water, and sediment..so what is point if I have to just rewash them?This sterilizer holds 6 bottles, nipples, tops, and pacifiers all at the same time. You can put breast pump parts in it, and anything else that you need to sterilize. I washed everything, filled this with the items and water, and popped it in at 6 minutes in our microwave to have perfectly clean and sterilized bottles, pacifiers, or breast pump parts. I used this everyday until my son was 6 months old, when we stopped sterilizing bottles. Its easy, safe, convenient, and fast.",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I thought this would be a great way to get my bottles clean but you still have to scrub them clean first yourself, THEN prepare this thing to stick in the microwave for x-amt of time, THEN wait for it to cool.... too much to do prior to getting a bottle ready for a fussy baby!&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;If your baby has an immune promblem, then this may be great for you, otherwise, skip on this and just buy a nice bottle brush.... I like the one by Munchkin.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;BUT if you still decide to get this, check it in the store first, because when I got mine home it was USED- it had obvisiously been returned (someone else thought it was useless too I guess) with milk residue on the bottles- yuck!",1
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"This item is very useful, although I feel there is one drawback...it is a bit too small. I am a first time mother and started using this a couple of days after we came home from the hospital. It took me about 3 weeks after all of my help had died down to come up with a ""system"" that works well for us. I make 18 bottles at a time (about 2 days worth). This system only holds 4 Avent bottles and six of the bottles that I use. Of course there is hardly enough space to sterilize all 18 bottles at pne time with this system. But it does come in handy to sterilize the nipples and all of the caps, while the bottles are being sterilized the old fashioned way, by boiling. Unlike many of the other users, I only use my dishwasher about twice a month, so this method is very handy.",4
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,This piece saved me unsurmountable time/effort. I was a breast pump mother--having to clean pump equipment/bottles every day. To boil water and ""cook"" those items every time......UGH!This is a reasonably priced sterilizer--worth every penny.,5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,Fast and easy to use.  Can put medela and gerber bottles and nipples in as well.  Great gift.,5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"This sterlizer is just not worth the time.  You are better off just boiling some water and throwing your bottles in there for a few minutes.  For the money, its definitely not worth it and I wish I never registered for it.",2
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,This is such a great sterilizer. It's easy to use and fast. I do four bottles at a time plus you can throw in a few Avent pacifiers and thier caps. This is so worth the money.,5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I bought this sterilizer after trying to hand clean my breatpump - not feeling it was clean enough when i was finished.I haven't regretted it since.  It is so easy to use, so quick, and everything looks clean as well as being sterile.I use it for the pump as well as bottles.I throw my son's pacifier's in every once in a while as well - it works great!If you don't run your dishwasher everyday, you need this product!",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I have used it for almost 4 months. I use Avent bottles and this saves time and hassle to sterilize them.Now, I don't use it, my baby is 8 months old, but for the first 4 months of his life, and my new motherhood, it sure was a help!!!",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"Don't even think twice about buying this...as Nike says...&quot;Just do it&quot;! The system is easy to use, the bottles are as sterile as a NASA lab (THAT is pretty darn sterile).  It is durable as well, mine has lasted through two children (and is on loan to a friend for their newborn) I cannot imagine any other way to handle the bottles.  BTW, buy the bottles and nipples, truely the best choice out there!",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,This product is nice if you are just going to use it to do just a few bottles.  If you are breast feeding and just using a few bottles.  If you use a dishwasher you really don't need it at all.  We have well water and no dishwasher so we have to sterlize all our bottles so the only 4 bottles at a time got old quick.  If you have a lot of bottles to do I would recommend a steam sterilizer that does 6-8 bottles at a time.  It's much more time efficiant.,3
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"This product is a life saver.  Before this device, all the parts from our breast pump, pacifiers, and bottles couldn't be sterlized quick enough.  It's simple and easy and FAST!!!  It is worth the shipping and price and will save you time and heartache in the long run.  Get it now before the baby gets here.  Our son came 10 days early and I had to next day air this thing in, once I saw the load I would be dealing with.",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"My son is now 18 months old.  I used this product from the time he was born until he was 10 months old and started using sippy cups.  I don't know what I would have done without it.  My husband was deployed and boiling bottles takes tons of time.  My dishwasher has the sanitizing cycle, but when I used it the bottles and nipples would still have a film on them.  The sterilizer kept them looking new.  I also felt better knowing that they had been through the sterilizing process in the microwave.  If you want to use your dishwasher, I would still recommend using this, it does not take much time at all.  I used it on medula pump parts and gerber bottles, even the tall 9 oz bottles would fit if you put them in right.  I would highly recommend this to anyone having a baby, it was one of the few products that I actually used on a regular basis.",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I really like this sterilizer. I did have to learn the hard way to remember to add water to it, or it will melt your items. I put my breast pump accessories and burned them up. So I just make sure there is plenty of water in it. It is a little hard to get out of the microwave when it is hot, but I just wrap a dish towel around it.",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I was not told by my doctor that I needed to sterlize my daughter's bottles, but I do anyway. This thing is great. It fits any type of bottle. I use it everyday. It so easy to use and fast. It takes only 4 mins to sterlize your bottles, nipples, pacifiers, etc.",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,When my first child was born I went the route of disposable liner bottle and found myself still using the dishwasher to sterilze the bottles even though my dishwasher was half full.  When my second child was born I decided to breastfeed and bought the whole Advent line of products.  My daughter is nine months old and I still sterilize them because it is too easy.  And if I had used the dishwasher the bottles would eventually end up looking dirty due to the scratches the detergent would have left.  This way my bottles still look new after nine months of use and I know they are clean.  Fast and easy.  In the begining you need to get the hang of opening it without burning yourself with the steam. Great gift for new moms.,5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I never use my dishwasher (I hand wash everything), so this sterilizer was really convenient and practical for my pre-mature baby.  The only problem I had was that 1 of the bottles got partially melted, and that was on about the 10th use of the sterilizer.  I haven't had any other difficulties since then, and that's even with laying my Dr. Brown's long & skinny bottles on their sides (I don't sterilize the inner tubing though, just in case).",4
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I'm not freaked out about germs. What I found was that the number of bottles and pump parts I was using each day was taking over the dishwasher completely. This is fast and easy, and I like that it provides a place to store items when traveling to the relatives for a weekend. I'm surprised that the box and manual didn't list all the parts that came in the box. Took me a while to figure out what all the bonus items were.",4
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,This is a great sterilizer and is so easy to use.  It can also double as a place to store your bottles.  I and my baby hated the bottles that come with it though.  They leak and are awkward to hold.,5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I had an electric steraliser (which died) before buying this one.  I wish I had had this steraliser all along.  It's so easy to load up, everything fits snuggly and has it's place (I had trouble with bottles falling over in my electric steraliser), and extremely easy to wash and keep clean (the electric steraliser was a pain to clean - especially the element).As we use Avent bottles - 4 fit perfectly and are steralised in 8 minutes (our microwave isn't very powerful).  From the instructions it looks like other bottles fit easily as well.I use this daily and haven't had a problem with it - easy to use, easy to secure the lid and I use it for my bottles and dummies.Recommended if you are using bottles and especially the Avent brand.",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,I got this for my first child because like every new Mom I wanted things to be sterile. I loved the easyness of use. This way I also had the bottles and their nipples all in one spot rather than flying around in my dishwasher which also uses unneccesary water if used every day only because of the bottles. Overall I thought this sterilizer is very helpful and I will use it again for my next babies fist months.,4
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I received the Express Microwave Steam Sterilizer as a baby shower present and I plan on giving it to any friend expecting in the future.  This product makes sterilizing bottles, nipples, breast pumps, and pacifiers easy.  I can't imagine making bottles without it, within 6 minutes everything is ready for bottle making.The sterilizer fits four bottles, including the nipple, cap and ring at one time.  After four minutes in the microwave(depending on the microwave, you mat have to leave it in for a longer period of time depending on the wattage of your microwave) and 2 minutes cooling off the bottles are ready to be filled.This is a definite recommendation, this product makes bottle making easier...after all being a new mom we need all the help we can get.",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"Being a first time Mom, you get blasted with all these lists of things that you ""need.""  I didn't know what I really needed and didn't need.  At first, I thought this sterilizer was a waste of money.  However, after having the baby, I was unable breastfeed- couldn't get my baby to ""latch on""-but wanted her to have breastmilk.  I pumped exclusively for the frist 6 weeks.  This sterilizer saved my life.  I used the Avent adapter for the Medela electric breast pump and was going through two bottles every 2-3 hours.  One would store the milk in the fridge and the other would get sterilized for the next round. I loved the fact that this is so quick, you can do it even in your sleep!  It also comes with 4 of the bigger 9 ounce AVENT bottles so you are really getting your money's worth.  Now, that I am not pumping, I still use it to sterilize bottles, pacifiers, and her plastic rings and keys that she LOVES to suck on.  Good luck!!",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"This is a fantastic gadget. It can be used with most types of bottles, pacifiers, teething, breast pumps.Like other reviewers we do have a dishwasher and that probably would suffice for sterilizing or at least getting clean enough. The microwave sterlizer saves us waiting 50 plus minutes for our dishwasher to run, it has meant that we don't have to run half empty loads just to get half a dozen clean bottles. Clearly far more energy efficient to nuke the sterilizer for 2 minutes than to use water/detergent/electricity to run the dishwasher.We hand wash our bottles, breast pump etc then load up the steriliser.Incidentally our arrived with two 9oz bottles inside the box, making it a little better value than we anticipated.",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"What an ease it finally is to sterilize everything...And I mean everything!  I am a breastfeeding mom and pumping.  I put all of my pumping supplies into this sterilizer as well as the Avent bottles.  It is great for Medela's tubing without worrying if boiled water is too hot to melt them.  I simply wash the bottles by hand by flipping over the large container as my wash basin, place them in the sterilizer bin, pour water, set in microwave, and it is done!  What parent couldn't live with out it?",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I breastfed my baby and some times you just gotta pump to get out of the house.  This made it so easy to clean up after you pump!  Just wash out the pump, add some water to the sterilizer and toss it in the microwave for four minutes.  It was a breeze and if you are low on bottles it makes getting some clean and sterilized so fast!!  If you are breastfeeding and using the occasional bottle, I seriously don't know what you'd do without it!",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I got this sterilizer after the birth of my daughter and trying to wash all my avent bottles and nipples.  I don't know about everyone else, but I only run my dishwasher at most every other day, and I didn't have enough bottles to last that long when she was eating every couple of hours.  Plus, I find that in the dishwasher little bits of food and guck get stuck in them, especially the nipples.  The sterilizer works great, simply, and fast! You, obviously need to at least rinse the bottles and nipples before putting them in.  I washed all my bottles with soap before putting them in the sterilizer just in case.Also, now that my daughter has moved on to sippy cups, I use the sterilizer to clean those annoying spill proof valves that are impossible to get clean and aren't supposed to go in the dishwasher.I did use it occaisionally for my breast pump parts as well and it worked great for them, I just didn't get to breast feed for very long :(It saves time, energy and water! A great product!!",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"This item is very fast and somewhat convenient to use. We are first time parents and are trying to keep everything (Bottles etc..) sterile as possible. Yes, everytime we have used the the Sterileizer it has condensation left in the top lid and it is sometimes a little hard to open up. Overall, it is just simply faster and seems to get the bottles very sterile. We have used this product approx. 2 weeks. I would reccommend this product for other parents.",4
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I would recommend this steamer for anyone who plans on using bottles, breast pump and or pacifiers.  Since I was nursing i didn't buy a lot of bottles and hated to run the dishwasher for 3 or 4 bottles.  But when you need them, you need them and this steamer was awesome.  Just load the bottles, etc and water and zap in the microwave and in a matter of 5 minutes or so they're ready to go.  I would list this as a must have and have recommended it to a couple of friends who have tried it and feel the same way!",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I don't have a dishwasher, so this saves me the hassle of having to boil water and sterilizing.  It says that everything inside will remain sterilized as long as you keep the lid on.  But then how will it all get dried?  That's the only down side.  You're suppose to take out the water after 2 minutes, but you have to leave the lid off or else the water won't evaporate.  When you boil water to sterilize, the water inside the bottles evaporate much more quickly.  This uses steam, so condensation is still left inside the bottles.  Just so you know.  Don't get me wrong, I like it a lot and it saves me time, I use it to sterilize my bottles and pump parts every night.  Just wished it allowed the water to evaporate more quickly.",4
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"This sterilizer is VERY simple to use.  You just pour in the amount of water according to your microwave wattage for the amount of time.  Recommended over the more expensive, non-microwave models.",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"This is a great product, if you need it.  I have a now 3 year old and twin 4 month olds.  I have only used the sterilizer about 15 times.  I bought it when I bought the Avent Isis Pump when my first child was about 6 months.  I needed the manual pump to take on vacation with me (smaller, takes up less room in the suitcase).  I never took the sterlizer out of my home, it is portable, but it is bigger than ""travel sized"".  I only used it when I sterilized the pump and once to sterilize the old bottles for the new babies.  My dishwasher (which I use everyday) and a dishwasher basket ($2 or less) work better than a $30 sterilizer.  When my twins were born 6 weeks premature, I used the electric Avent sterlizer at the hospital for the pump pieces (they provided one while the babies were in NICU). Now I just throw everything in the dishwasher baskets and turn on the dishwasher.Overall I liked the product, but I really didn't need it.",4
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"Washing bottles has never been easier!  This has been an easy way to clean bottles in a matter of minutes versus waiting for the dishwasher or hand washing them- so easy my husband helps all the time!  This item is also great for traveling and you can even sterilize other itmes as pacifiers, plastic spoons etc.  Just becareful when you open the unit not to burn yourself with the hot water.  Another helpful tip- when drying the bottles, cloth diaper rags work great.",4
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,This is great for sterilizing the bottles. It's so nice to not have to boil water and hope that we're not melting the bottles.  You only need to microwave them for four minutes and then cool for two minutes before opening the lid.  I should let you know that it is extremely hot (and steamy) so you will need to be careful using it.,5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"We initially bought this sterilizer for use with our first child born in 2005. I loved it then, but I'm even more impressed with some updated details in the version we just bought for our second child. Before, putting on and removing the lid used to be a bit awkward. Now, easy-to-use latches have made doing both completely hassle-free. The inner steam tray also has more slots and spots that make arranging items easier. The older version was very similar but did not have specialized ""compartments"" to such an extent. All in all, it remains an extremely easy product to use because if I had to sit there sterilizing by boiling water and whatnot, it surely would not get done. That the sterilizer comes with bottles is pure bonus. I'd buy the steamer alone.",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,In 4 minutes I can sterilize 4 9-ounce Avent bottles (plus caps). I can fit 6 4-ounce bottles in it. I have also sterilized Medela pump parts. Really does a good job!,4
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"The Avent microwavable bottle sterilizer was absolutely a life saver!  My son is almost 9 months old and I am still using this product.  Since I would wash the bottles no matter what, I feel like why not just stick them in the sterilizer and put them in the microwave for 4 minutes.  It is just one extra step that takes only 4 minutes and I am guaranteed a sterile bottle! I plan to use the sterilizer as long as my son is taking a bottle, but I also use the Avent sippy cups so I might just continue to use it for those too!",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"After figuring out that I was going to pump and bottle feed, my husband went out and found this. It has been great! We sterilize not only the bottles, but pacifiers and my pumping equipment. I think that we will probably use it for some plastic toys as well, when the time comes. Within minutes the bottles cool off, which is great if they are needed as soon as possible.This would make an awesome shower gift!",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I love this sterilizer.  I wash bottles, nipples, pacifiers, and breatpump items, then put them in the sterilizer, along with 7 ounces of water and then in the microwave for 4 minutes.  Everything is sterilized and I can leave it all in there until I need it or I put it on the drying rack. But there's no sense in stirring a boiling pot of water for the same protection.  Who needs that at 4 am?! Get some sleep while you can!  I see no drawbacks whatsoever with this item.",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"This is one of the most helpful gagets yet!  Fast, quick and easy!",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"This is one of the best baby products that I own! I actually sterilize my Medela breast pump parts in it every day! It is fast and easy. I can't imagine boiling water every day to sterilize my bottles and pump parts. Now, Medela says that you shouldn't use this for their products but I have never had any trouble and I have used it with both my children.",2
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,I'd only add that the best way to deal with the condensation inside the bottles and nipples is to use a paper towel (not a bacteria-laden dish towel).,5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"This is a great product and I highly recommend it.  The best sterilizing option since I don't have enough dishes to bother using the dishwasher more than once every two days.  Even if you just want to clean one pacifier, it uses less water and energy than boiling on the stove and it's quicker too.  It saves my skin from hand washing in scorching hot water  (but I still give things a quick rince in warm soapy water before tossing them in the sterilizer).  It is a lifesaver when pumping and bottle feeding.The only drawback is the space that it takes up - it is about 12 inches in diameter and 6 inhes tall.  But I use mine so much, I just keep it in the microwave when I'm not using it!",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,This sterilizer is great...not too big but definitely not too small. It holds (4) 4 oz. bottles or (4) 9 oz. bottles. Not to mention there are great little grooves so that you know everything is in there the right way. It is also great for the Isis breast pump parts. I used it daily while my baby was nursing and even now that she is 7 months old. We had a pretty bad case of thrush which the Dr. said was most likely coming from the pumped bottles I was doing for her. The dishwasher was not cutting it obviously when it came to sterilizing for my baby. We bought this steam sterilizer and within a matter of 2-3 days the thrush was completely gone and never came back. I highly recommend it. Although I don't find it completely necessary for it to include the (2) 9 oz. bottles with it...seeing as if you are using this you most likely already have bottles. GREAT STERILIZER!!!!,5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I got this item off my registery.I loved them because i was breastfeeding and wanted the wide nipple for little confusion to my daughter. She loved the bottles and didn't have spit up problems or reflux, thank goodness. My daughter is off bottles now but for the year i used bottles, i only used the Avent and the Playtex diposables. I love both and would use them again with my next baby to be!",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"Wash 4 bottles, place them in the provided tub and 4 minutes later you have sterile bottles you can use( and store ) for the next 4 feedings. Very convenient.",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,LOVE this sterilizer and use it all the time. A little tricky to get them to all fit but I've got it down to a science! Even fits the 9oz bottles if you place them strategically :),5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,I did not register for this but bought it after my son was born. I was sick of boiling water or waiting for a full load to run the dishwasher. I found that when I used the dishwasher bottles and nipples turned colors depending on the food that we ate that week. (red when we ate pasta). This is a great thing to have and we still use it a few times a week and my son is 10 wks old.,5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"We thought it would be a great time saver.  Turns out most of the products we were going to use in it (i.e. Medela bottles and pump accessories, feeding bottles and nipples, etc.) specifically say, &quot;Do not place in a microwave steamer&quot;.  Save your money and use a 3 or 4qt pan you already have and boil the items for 5 to 20 minutes.",1
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"Very easy to use, but don't feel that it is a must have.  All baby's need to develop their immune system and therefore I feel a good hot water and soap cleaning does the trick.  Have only used the sterilizer once, my baby is now 4 months - hasn't been sick yet.",3
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"This is a great product.  We use the Avent Bottles &amp; Avent Isis Breast Pump and they are made to fit into this sterilizer.  However, it works just as well on other stuff.  (You don't have to use their configurations to get good results.)  It's so much easier than boiling.  You just pop it in the microwave for 5 minutes and everything is sterilized.  We love it.",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"My almost 4 month old son is VERY small (24th percentile!) so the doctor recomended me buying a sterelizer, in other cases careful scrubing and just putting the bottles in the dishwasher would do, and it can save you some trouble. but for those people who need or really want a sterelizer, this ones great. Its much less expensive than the other sterelizers that take over all your counter space! It cleans my bottles very well, and I use mostly avent by the way. It can also sterelize my 2 1/2 year olds ""magic cups"" after he gets over a virus or if he had milk (another product by avent). It is fairly simple to use and much less stressful than boiling water, in my opinion. It also comes with 4 bottles, although my house is a bottle factory as it is! This sterelizer can also be used as a drying rack if needed. I love this sterelizer and it has kept my small son very healthy, happy and playful!",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I had thought I would exclusively breastfeed, but that didn't happen. I started using the gerber and medela bottles, but my baby was very gassy. I switched to Dr. Brown's. LOVE THEM..But then suddenly, I was overwhelmed by all the bottles I had to clean and sterilize.. Since I was afraid I would leave items boiling on the stove, I got the Express Microwave Sterilizer.. Once I figured out how to make the bottles attach to the little tags, it was a breeze!!  It is a little annoying that I have to throw my plastic and metal caps into the dishwasher and that the pacifiers only go for 1/2 the time that the bottles do. But otherwise..GREAT PRODUCT!!!",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I bought this product thinking it would be a very good purchase with the bottles included, but I soon came to realise that the avent bottles leak b/c the top doesn't seal properly.  This happens with all 4 bottles and is very disappointing since I thought Avent was a good product recommended by mother's worldwide.  The sterilizer has been the best part of this purchase as it definitely comes in handy when you don't have a full load in the dishwasher and you want a clean bottle in a matter of minutes.  I wouldn't recommend the bottle especially with being a first time mom - it just adds to the stress and lets face it, who needs more stress with a newborn!!",1
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,i love this product because it makes my life so much easier. it saves so much time. all i do is wash the bottles put in the sterilizer and 4 minutes later is done. i would recomend this product.,5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"BE CAREFUL! Sometimes when you are lifting the steamer out of the microwave the top will separate from the bottom and steam will escape and burn your fingers.  Other than that this is an AWESOME sterilizer, very quick and convenient.  I wash my bottles, forego the dish drainer and put them right in this.  When it's full I just add the water and throw it in the microwave and in 7 minutes the bottles are done. Great for pacifiers as well. I don't know if there is a taller model, but it would be nice to be able to stand up 8 oz bottles to sterilze as well.  Riht now I just lay them down in this one, I assume that's ok???  Very quick and easy to use.",3
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"We love this sterilizer! We put all our Avent Bottles to Sterilize, it did a very good job!  I don't trust the dishwasher, all the greasy dishes mix with baby bottles, NO WAY!!!",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I bought this item and realized that my microwave was 1500 watts and it is for 500-1100 wattage microwaves.  I called and the rep told me i could use it with my wattage.  Dont do it, it burned up my microwave somehow.  Avent says this is not possible, but what  a cooincidence.",1
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"My mom bought this sterilizer for me with my first child and now 4 years later, about to give birth again, we purchased the same one again since it was so convenient.  Sterilizing isn't completely necessary, I know, but with this product it is SO EASY I see no reason not to.  I have several different brands of bottles and pacifiers and you can put them all in there.  My microwave is 900W (I found out by typing in the model number online) so it just takes 4 minutes.  We paid $30 at Target for it and I think it's worth it.  Much faster than a dishwasher, cheaper than a counter-top sterilizer and you still get everything sterilized with hardly any trouble at all.",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,This sterlizer is so easy and convenient to use.  It takes only 5 mints and your bottles are sterlized.  And it does not take up much space.  Its one of the best shower gifts you can get anyone!!,5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"Can't live without it! This item is so unbelievably easy to use. I recommend this item to any parent that wants to save time or use their time doing something else, which is everyone! 2 minutes and you're done.",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"True - it is not a big deal to boil water.  However, with all that there is going on in caring for a baby, it is easy to forget that the boiling water is going, or not be able to respond to the timer going off.... and soon you have warped your bottles, nipples or breast pump parts.With this, you have a few simple steps, and you are done. Best yet, if you forget this in the microwave, it only helps you by cooling the whole setup off.Another reviewer commented that this is more work than the dishwasher.  While this is true - it is a huge waste of energy to run a dishwasher that is not full.  Therefore, you are either going to waste energy, or have to wait until you have a full load.  For us, the latter was never an option.This tool has enough space to accommodate our bottles (from Playtex, not advent) and breast pump parts.Finally, with the ease of use, it is easy to overdo it and sterilize more than you have to.  For me, that is vastly preferable to under doing it while waiting for a dishwasher load, or due to the annoyance of boiling.",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"Things don't really have to be sterilized. Even the head nurse on our hospital tour told us that. (She said that the dishwasher was enough.) We tried this, but the condensation takes forever to dry, so we are going to use our dishwasher and get our money back.",3
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"This product is excellent! As a first time mom I wasn't sure how I was going to sterilize those bottles. A friend of mine said years ago when she had her kids she had to boil her bottles for 20 minutes. The first day I brought my son home I found myself tearing into the package to get to this sterilizer. It's so simple. You add 7 fluid ounces of water (use one of your bottles as a measuring guide), you put your bottles in it, and you slap it in the microwave for 4 minutes. You let it cool for 2 minutes and that's it!",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"We just love this sterilizer.  It is so easy to load up and the baby's bottles, nipples, etc. plus pacifiers are sterilized in under 5 minutes.  No muss no fuss!  I have recommended this product to friends.  You'll be glad you purchased it!  VR",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,I agree with all of the reviews here.  I also use mine to sterilize my Medela Pump in Style breast pump parts too.  I tried this once on the stove and it was a pain compared to using the Avent Express Microwave Steam Sterilizer.,5
"Mam Mini Ulti Gem Size 1 Latex Value Pack, Multiple Colors","When I received these pacifiers, it was obvious that the packaging had been opened and resealed.  The silicone on the pacifiers was old and scuffed looking.  I didn't even consider using them or letting my baby put one in her mouth.  Also, although the listing says 'size 1', these pacifiers were for babies 6 months and up.  Complete waste of money!",1
"Mam Mini Ulti Gem Size 1 Latex Value Pack, Multiple Colors","I love these orthodontic pacifiers - they're the best.  And for convenience, it was so nice to be able to purchase them online, as they're difficult to find in some of our frequently-shopped stores.  But the fact that you can't request a color is pretty stupid.  Our baby is a boy, and we really have no interest in getting red, yellow, pink or purple pacifiers, but requesting specific colors is not allowed.  (We were sent 2 yellow and red packs, by the way.) It would be a customer-friendly choice to allow shoppers some individual preferences with these.",5
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,"When I was pregnant with my first set of twins I felt that I could handle EVERYTHING. (i.e no exersaucer to babysit, not bouncers, no ridiculous toys, no uneeded baby products, and yeah, no sterelizer). Well my husband said we needed most of the stuff I said we didnt. But he let me be stuborn and didnt purchase the sterelizer. Well after 2 1/2 years of boiling bottles, pacifiers, teethers and all that other stuff, I was going crazy. Yet I still wouldnt admit it to my husband :). When the second set of twins were on the way, I was ready. I was going to buy baby wipes warmers, exersaucers, bouncers, swings, the aquarium crib soother and this sterelizer. Well this sterelizer is my hero (as well as my husband who forced me to get one!). It cleans about 6 bottles and all of the things that come with them. (actually it cleans 5 of the playtex airvent ones, but I use avent too). I did breast feed so it also cleans avent pumps (and my friend managed to get another kind in one!). My kids love pacifires so those are constantly in there, and so are all those teething rings. Let me just tell you that you can NOT put a dirty item in here, you still have to wash it a bit. This just makes sure its really clean, (my kids have maybe been sick 5-6 times, all four of them put together!) This sterelizer is great, and it uses very little water (I have a purifier so I use pure water). like another reviewer I HIGHLY RECOMEND TO UNPLUG IT WHEN NOT IN USE! I will say it again, after boiling bottles and sippy cups and pacifires and teethers all night, REGISTER FOR THIS! ITs a bit pricey but I can gaurentee that replacements for the bottles that you disintigrated while boiling and sleeping at the same time, and doctor visits and medicine for those odd illnesses due to unsanitary things that your child(ren) place in their mouth, will cost you more!*** P.S... IT MAKES A GREAT DRYING RACK TOO!",5
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,"I didn't like the idea of running my breastpump in the dishwasher with dishes covered in food, even if it does say that the high temps will sterilize it.  I didn't even dream of boiling the parts of my breastpump, who has time for that?  I use this product everyday, sometimes twice a day.  It gives me the peace of mind that I am keeping as much bacteria as possible out of my expressed milk, which means it will be able to be stored as long as possible.  That's important, because pumping is not very fun, and we all like to do it as little as we have to.  Now, even if I just want to sterlize only my breastpump, I use just a little bit of water and it takes only 8 minutes!  Much less time than boiling or using the dishwasher.  One word of caution, this sterilizer will fit many bottles, and will fit the pump, but you cannot fit nine lids, rings, nipples, AND bottles and your breastpump.  If you just sterlize your pump and the nine bottles, it will fit along with a ring or two and maybe one nipple.  Or you can stack stuff on top of each other, but beware as it may topple out on you when you pull it out of the sterlizer.  I still gave the product 5 stars, because I find that its capacity usually fits my needs anyway (i am a breastfeeding stay-at-home mom that expresses breastmilk for evening feedings for my husband and short trips away from baby).",5
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,"We love this sterilizer.  I never boiled bottles, but I couldn't imagine anything more time consuming.  This sterilizer is so fast!  I just washed &amp; rinsed her bottles and pacifiers, added the bottled water (we have well water at our house) and pushed start!  The best thing is how many bottles it holds.  We used the Playtex Ventair and I could fit 6 bottles and all their parts in this sterilizer.  I would run it every night before I went to bed and everything was ready to go the next morning!  What is even better, now that she is 10 mo. old (no longer need to sterilize everything), I use the racks to put her stuff into dry.  I highly recommend this sterilizer!",5
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,"My friend gave me this sterilizer and I just love it.  I had not thought I would need it, but let me tell you, it is a very nice convenience.  It only takes 8 minutes to sterilize, much quicker than the dishwasher or boiling.  I'd highly recommend this product!",5
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,Great product but you must buy a drain board for the bottles. Bottles don't dry and if left in steamer longer than an hour bottles may develop bacteria.,3
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,I strongly recomend this product is very easy to use and does an excellent job sterlizing bottles.,5
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,"I love the modern look it has.  Also, it is very easy to use and has lots of space to even clean toys.  It not only cleans your bottles but also organizes them and keeps the clean.  It is easy to use, and within 8 minutes the bottles, baby toys or any other thing you migth want to sterilize will be ready and clean.  This is a Must-have for new Moms!",5
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,"This one is easy.  Put your stuff in, add a little water then push a button.  Truely a no brainer.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that you do have to drain it after each use.  My freind didn't and something started growing in it.  Other than that, this is perfect.  If you take out the racks you can fit a ton in it at once.  You don't have to watch over anything-go ahead and take care of your baby while this one does all the work for you.  Put this time saver on you registry.",4
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,"I absolutely love this product.  I can't imagine that I actually boiled bottles with my first child.  This product is a no-hassle product.  A matter of fact, it takes more time washing the bottles before I put them into the sterilizer than it does to sterilize them.",5
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,"I got this gift at my baby shower.  It is great because when you are caring for a newborn, you tend to forget things, not to mention fall asleep.  Thanks to this timed sterilizer and automatic turn off switch, your bottles will never melt!",5
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,"Easy to use when you read the directions,beats boiling water where you can accidently burns items, I had it for a year , love it, use it for when we go away, so I don't have to worrie about bringing to mant bottles, sterilize them &amp; binkys in 8 mins,and then shuts off automatically.also better than a dishwasher , uses less water.this was definitly a must have!",5
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,"This makes bottle preparing soooooo much easier.  I use Playtex Vent-Aire bottles instead of Avent, and you can fit 7 of them in it at once.  Forget boiling!",5
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,"This is a good product and very easy to use.  My only complaint is that the bottles come out really wet and it is a bit annoying, but I guess that is expected.  I put less water sometimes, but they still come out soaked.  Anyway, in general, it is something necessary and the automatic shut off is a big plus.",4
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,"This sterilizer is so easy to use!  With our first child we boiled everything in a pan on the stove and often scorched something if we became distracted by a screaming baby.  But with this product, you just put in a little bit of water, load it with whatever you want to sterilize, push the button, and walk away.  More than just Avent products fit in this, including Medela breast pump parts.  So far we have not found anything that doesn't fit in this sterilizer.  We highly recommend this product - it is well worth the money!",5
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,"I am primarily breastfeeding, but I thought this would be useful for sterilizing pump parts and the occasional bottles, etc..  I discovered Medela Microwave Steam Cleaning Bags instead, and this thing went in the closet.  I feel badly for the waste of money...but the bags are SO much easier!!!  And not space consuming.  Plus you can use them during travel, at the office, etc..  Much more cost efficient and useful!",1
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,"When my first daughter was born, Avent did not make this sterilizer.  Now I use it every night to clean all the bottles plus pacifier and toys.  Once in a while I do see some black residue, but it is only carbon and my doctor assures me that it is not a big deal.  Just rinse it off.  It sure beats boiling a whole big pot of water every night!",5
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,"I think some of the other reviewers have forgotten the golden rules here, you MUST READ INSTRUCTIONS. This unit is not to CLEAN bottles and such, it's a sterilizer only. As in the instructions, as I'm reading, and typing from in front of me here... &quot;BEFORE EACH USE - 1) Before sterilising, wash all items in mild soapy water and rinse.&quot; If after a while you're still getting a film, you need to rub neat salt on the bottles and nipples, it's a build up of milk fat.This product does EVERYTHING it states, and if cared for properly should last a long time, I purchased mine in September 1993, right 1993!!! And it works just fine to date after a long vacation in storage.",5
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,"Now that I am going back to work, and my baby has to use the bottle, this sterilizer is great! Not only did I use it to sterilize my baby's bottles, nipples, pacifiers...but I also use this to for sterilizing parts of my breast pump. This is definitely better than the microwave sterilizer. It automatically shuts off when it's done, no need to worry once you switch in on. It's like having a separte dishwasher for your baby.",5
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,"This has to have been one of my favourite purchases for baby - along with the Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer. My husband and I had some controversy going initially on whether this was worth the money or not, and even HE now admits that it is worth it's weight in gold in terms of convenience, ease of use and overall good value for money. We keep a dish of soapy water in the sink and dump all bottles and binkys in there, rinse them off and load them into the sterilizer. Within minutes they are done and if you don't open them for a few hours they can stay in the unit until you're ready for them. I know that many people say you don't strictly need to sterilize everytime but with this you can run it as often as you want, it's a godsend for breastpump parts and according to our pediatrician, sterilizing is better for baby for the first weeks when they are so susceptible to germs. I would advise anyone thinking on this purchase to GO FOR IT. I can fit my entire breastpump and up to 5 bottles in as well as pacifiers in one go. This has made my life so easy! It also has a warranty just by the way, so those who have complained it packed up within a year, you could have had it replaced free of charge!",5
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,"I remember the days you would use a pot and hot water to sterilize your baby bottles.  Not anymore.  I received this as a gift from my babyshower.  One of the best gifts I could have received.  You add water, pack the sterilizer, push the button and no need to watch until it's done.  This is a &quot;have to have&quot; product.",5
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,"The sterilized bottles have an odd smell of...burned plastic. I am sure they are clean, but I am not sure this smell is good for my baby.",3
Philips Avent Electric Steam Sterilizer,"I'm not sure how I made it through having my first child without this.  It's so quick and convenient to use.  Works great for bottles, pacifiers, and breastpump attachments (even though I have an other than Avent brand breastpump).  With my first daughter I used the dishwasher to clean her bottles which was not always convenient.  When the dishwasher needed to be run and when I needed to wash bottles didn't always turn out to be the same times.  This is also great for travel.  I've had this sterilizer for 9 months and LOVE IT!",5
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"well, i purchased this at a local store despite erroneous reviews found here.  its a great device, at first it seemed wasteful since i could just microwave some water (3 minutes), then soak the bottle until it warmed up (3 more minutes) but now i can just pop in a bottle and the whole thing is done in under 3 minutes.  if youve got an extra $40 i recommend it.",4
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"THE LIGHT ON THIS GOES ON &amp; OFF MANY TIMES BEFORE I THINK THE FORMULA IS WARM ENOUGH WHICH IS ABOUT 3 MINUTES, PLUS I LEFT IT PLUGGED IN ACCIDENTLY MANY TIMES BY ACCIDENT...THIS HAS NO ON/OFF SWITCH &amp; THE LIGHT IS MEANINGLESS...THIS PRODUCT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT!!!",1
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"If you live in a two story house, you need one warmer for upstairs and one warmer for downstairs!",5
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"I originally got the Especially for Baby warmer and was very disappointed.  That product made the milk scalding hot and we had to cool down the milk...not very pretty when your baby is screaming at 2 AM.  The Avent warmer is great.  It quickly takes the chill out of refridged bottles in about 3-4 minutes.  You can't walk away though, the bottle may become too hot if left for multiple heating cycles.  Some tips, we found helpful.  1) the water line must be at the level of the milk or the bottles will float.  2) take caps off of bottles or the pressure builds up in the nipple and you get a squirt",5
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"Well, I too bought the bottle warmer and didn't think for a second that it doesn't include things like automatic shut off or timer. I thought that is the whole purpose of the bottle warmer. Basically after 3 months of using it I gave up because I find myself forgetting to turn it off and having the milk too hot. I now use my electric kettle. My very pretty and expensive (I may add) bottle warmer became a gadget collecting dust.",1
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"This warmer does the job, but you should be careful not to forget and leave the milk in it longer than it has to(unfotunatelly there is not timer or allarm), because it gets HOT in no time. That happened a couple of times to me and I stopped useing it. It was much easier for me to put the bottle in a hot water from the sink. That was doing the same - without overheating the milk and spending $40.",3
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"After reading some of the reviews I felt compelled to share my experience with this product.  I love it!  I'm not sure if they made a different model before, but mine has an on/off switch that works just fine (its on the back).  Its not rocket science if you follow the directions.  I never have problems with the bottle floating.  If you put the bottle in first and then fill the warmer with water like the directions tell you to, then the bottle won't float.  The warmer itself has a chart on it that tells you how long to leave the bottle in the warmer and at what setting.  It also has a light that flashes on and off when the warmer has reached a constant temperature.  There are no ""dings"" or timers, but that hasn't presented any problems for me.  Overall this product does what it is supposed to do and it does it well.  As a first time mom, I highly recommend it.",5
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"I chose this warmer because I was using the Avent bottle system and thought it would be designed the best to warm my bottles.  The only good thing I can say about this warmer is it is consistent.  It warms the bottle in the same amount of time each feeding, no surprise hot bottles.  But the warmer doesn't have an on/off switch.  Every time you warm the bottle you have to plug it in and remember to unplug it when you are done.  This didn't seem like a pain the first week.  But when you have a crying squirming baby and you have to reach across the counter to jerk the cord out of the wall everytime it gets to be big deal.  The second disappointment was that it was more expensive than all the other warmers and there doesn't seem to be anything special about it.  It lacks features the others have like auto-shut off and a chiller/cooler.  Now my baby sleeps through the night but if I had to do it over again I would have bought the Dusk to Dawn bottle warmer.  It would have made 2am feedings a little more bearable.",1
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"In a nutshell:  You can by a similar or even better bottle warmer for $18 if you look at other brands.  That's a savings of $22!  This unit does not have any features the others don't, and it isn't that much prettier or that much smaller or easier to use.In the end, I returned both this bottle warmer and the $18 other brand bottle warmer.  Now I use my microwave to heat up a cup of water for my cold bottles.",1
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"A friend of mine was terribly disappointed in the Avent bottle warmer, so went out and bought The First Years brand.  She RAVED about it so much that I went out and bought one (I was using the stove-top to heat the bottles to that point).  I love it so much.  Yes, I ocassionally have to run bottles through a second time to get them heated up nice and warm - but it is still easy and convenient.  It was [inexpensive]",2
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"This is a great warmer!  Keep in mind with any warmer, you have to keep an eye on it. We used it primarily to heat breast milk.  It's great because you can adjust the heat and it's CONSISTENT.  When you first get it, set the dial in the middle, put a bottle of refrigerated milk in it and then keep testing it at 1 minute, 2 minutes, etc. until you know how long it takes at a dial setting to heat the milk to the temperature you want.  If you know you want more time to let the bottle heat, turn it down and do the same test.  Likewise for less time. We got it so we set the dial at a position and left it for 3-4 minutes and got exactly the temp we wanted.  We used it for more than a year and the thing was consistent the whole time.  It's espeially great because you can leave a nanny with instructions and feel more at ease that she'll get it right.",5
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,I received this warmer for my baby shower and have not had a problem with it.  Overall I am satisfied with the product.  It heats evenly and is compact for the countertop.  Some people commented on there not being an on/off switch.  There is a toggle switch in the back right above the cord.  The only thing this product needs is a timer.,4
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"This is one of my favorite baby products as far as convenience goes. I've read several of the reviews here. I do agree that the absence of an on/off switch is somewhat of a nuisance, however this is my only complaint. With regard to a lot of the other consumer gripes and methods of use, I disagree and feel I must address them. Obviously, as with any new product acquired, it is usually most beneficial to a consumer to carefully read the instructions and follow them. The front of the warmer has a convenient diagram to remind the user of heating and timing settings per size and type of bottle. To warm regular Avent 4 oz. or 9 oz. bottles that have previously been refrigerated (~40 degrees), and for bottles prepared at around room temp (~70 degrees), the thermostat needs to be at 3. The water levels and heating times differ. I feel that I need to reiterate some of the instructions for any of you prospective consumers who would like to be well and accurately informed:Hazard Warning:-Always unplug when not in use.-Always place bottle into warmer BEFORE adding water.-Ensure water has been added before switching the unit on.-When the feed has reached the required temperature, remove immediately. If left in the warmer, the temperature of the feed will continue to increase.Instructions for use for regular Avent feeding bottles:-Ensure basket is in place inside the warmer.-Place the assembled, filled bottle in the warmer.-For 4 oz. bottles, (slowly- to avoid air bubbles) fill the  warmer with water to just above the level of milk in the bottle.-For larger bottles, fill the warmer to 1/2 inch below the rim of the warmer.-Never let the water level rise above the neck of the bottle, or spill over the edge of the warmer.-Plug in the unit . Turn the dial setting to 3.-The light will illuminate to indicate the warmer is working.-When the water has reached the correct temperature, the light will come on and  off to indicate that the water surrounding the bottle is kept at a constant temperature.-Always shake the bottle gently and check the temperature of the milk by sprinkling a few drops on to your wrist before you feed your baby.If you follow these instructions and set a timer you should have a perfectly warmed 4 oz bottle in 5 minutes for previously refrigerated bottles; a 9 oz (previously refrigerated) bottle will be warmed in 6 minutes. Times for heating bottles from room temp are 4 minutes for either size.I personally own the regular Avent bottles. This warmer will also accommodate the Avent Disposable System bottles, Avent Magic cup, baby food jars, and other makes of bottles. Instructions for these vary slightly for heat settings and times.The basket can also be removed to allow the varying types to fit inside.Overall, I am very happy with this product. It has saved me a lot of time and headaches.",4
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"This warmer is for sure the best on the market right now. I say this since I went through just about every other warmer out there and had to return them due to overheating and inconsistance with warming bottles. After I purchased the Avent warmer, I had a perfect bottle every time. It takes a little longer to heat the bottles then other warmers I had purchased, (7 minutes for an 8 ounce bottle) but do to the fact that the bottle is not overheated and the aggrevation of having to dump out formula and then add cold formula it is well worht the extra couple minutes of waiting. The only thing that the warmer lacks is an on-off switch, but I still give it a 5 star rating due to the fact that I have used all other warmers and none of them performed like this one. Definatly a must if you need a warmer.",5
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"This Product line has always gotten 5 stars from me, but not wih this item. It's a WASTE! You're better off just warming up water and letting the bottle sit in it for a minute or two. And least you won't be outed twenty or thirty some odd bucks. This can be very dangerous to baby if you are not careful. I purchase one for myself and one for my cousin since our babies are one month apart. I used mine a few and it over heated the bottle and I followed the directions and everything. At first it feels warm but when you shake the bottle sometimes you feel the temp of the bottle getting warmer and that tends to happen because the center of the bottle gets the hottest. It has NO timer or on/off button so you have to babysit the thing. BE CAREFUL you may scortch babys mouth with the hot milk. Lord forbid if you forget that it has to be unplug it will overheat and konk out like the one I purchased for my cousin. After that she cursed me out and went to warming milk on the stove.",2
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"This product is garbage. It has no ability to heat a bottle to specific temperature, and will eventually get the temp to near boiling if you are not careful. No different than water in a pot on a stove, you have no temp control. It's going back. I don't understand why it is do difficult to find a product that will get the temp of a bottle to the right temp, and keep it there.",1
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"Another quality product from Avent!!! I love this warmer. It is fast and easy. I love that there are 3 temperature settings for different heating levels. It is great for warming both bottles and baby food. If you love Avent, then you must have this!!!",5
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"The Avent is the best we've used so far as it will get as hot as you want it to and quickly (the whole point), without steam. And it fits the Avent larger bottles. Its also got an on/off switch on the back so you dont have to keep unplugging it.Don't mess around with the others.Tried the First Years brand...after a few weeks it stops geting hot enough fast enough. Same BTW with the cheap Target brands.  Tried the steamer types..they burn your fingers unless you use tongs! Try using tongs with a crying baby on your hip!",4
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"My husband and I bought this thinking that it would warm up our bottles. Since I have had this warmer I have overcooked and undercooked the milk. It has never heated up my daughters bottles warm enough in the 4 minutes, and it overheats it if you use a higher setting. I was extremely surprised when we got it home and noticed that there was not an on/off switch. Had a read the reviews before purchasing this warmer I would not have done so. When your baby is screaming because of hunger having to wait another 2 minutes to get it warm seems like eternity! I use Advent bottles and the microwave sterilizer and I am completely satisfied. I think the warmer though needs a few changes.",2
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"Not knowing what to look for in a bottle warmer, I was attracted to this model because it was small in size and didn't take up a lot of counterspace.  I have no complaints about its warming capabilities, but after using the warmer several times, I found I really needed a few more features than it offered:The unit does not have an automatic timer, which means YOU have to keep up with how long the bottle has been in the warmer.  And when you are trying to deal with a fussy infant, it's easy to lose track of time and overheat the bottle.The unit has no Off/On switch and must be unplugged after each use.Another small annoyance is the bottle does not sit flat, but floats unevenly in the water while heating.I finally purchased another model which included these features.",2
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"I'm a new mom and I am a big believer in the Avent line of products. This bottle warmer, however, is not one of their more stellar efforts. The instructions say that once the bottle has reached the appropriate temperature (which the device is supposed to know, based on the amount of time for which you've set the dial), the warmer will maintain the warm temperature until such time that you're ready to use the bottle. Well, it does, in fact, warm the bottle, but the machine just keeps making the bottle hotter and hotter! I put a bottle into the warmer and got distracted by my little one for a few minutes. When I went back to get the bottle, so that I could feed him, I was shocked to discover that it was so scalding hot that I could barely touch it! Not only is this inconvenient, it could also be very dangerous! After only two uses, this warmer has a new home on the top shelf of my pantry, where it will likely sit until the end of time. Save yourself the money and just warm your bottles by putting them in a bowl of hot water. Much easier, less time-consuming, and cheaper!!",1
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"This thing is very hard to figure out. One setting gets the bottle too hot too fast, try another setting for 15 min's and you still have cold milk! I tried to use it for 3 months... finally gave up. Save the money. Warm water in the microwave and stick the bottle in that... Sometimes we need to listen to our mom's and grandma's - they didnt have these and we turned out fine!",1
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"My sister-in-law told us not to register for this because she couldn't get it to work.  Well, I wanted it and I registered for it anyway.  We got it and I decided to give it a try just to make sure it worked.  I used it the next time my friend came over with her newborn and it worked great.  Just add a little water, throw in the bottle, and in minutes it was perfect.  My only suggestions would be to add an on/off switch and a timer.  But other than that, it's another great product by Avent.",4
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,Save your money.  You can heat a bottle faster under hot running tap water or by heating a bowl of water in the microwave and sitting the bottle in it.  This bottle warmer is definitly not a necessary item.  It is expensive and it takes too long to heat a bottle.,1
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"i use all of avent's products and would rate all of them highly with the exception of this product.  i agree with the other moms about the lack of an auto-off feature, the confusing light that tells you when the bottle is done but quickly goes off and continues to heat the bottle if you do not watch it closely, etc.  But what i found most dangerous is this: when most of us are going to get the bottle out of the warmer, we are busy and carrying the baby with us.  this warmer creates a slick of moisture from the steam and water on the outside, and (god forbid) if it slips from your hands it splashes back into the hot water, sending the hot water all over the counter and possibly at you and the baby.  The part that confuses me most is that we then bought a more inexpensive version from babies r us under ""the first years"" brand, and it is great- has all the safety features you would want, less confusing with the water measurement, and the water you put in completely evaporates when the bottle is ready.  much better product for less.",1
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"It needs to be a little more practical. I brought this product with the expectation of it being a step one and done type of product. It turned out to be a step one, two and three.... I don't have time. My microwave is easier becuse I have one button to push for baby food and milk.",2
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"Warming up bottles quickly was a challenge for my husband and I when we had our newborn who couldn't wait a minute for a bottle.We tried 1)warming water in microwave and putting bottle in water and waiting forever for it to warm up 2)then we kept warm water in a flask and mixed formula instantly using that warm water and of course the bubbles formed during that mixing and instant feeding caused tons of gas and spit up for our baby. Nothing was working well for us and we would loose lots of sleep waiting for bottles to warm up or bubbles to settle in the middle of the night. Finally I tried a Walmart brand bottle warmer...big mistake. Returned that one and got this one and it has been our life saver. It heats up 7oz in no time. When we go somewhere, the unit is small enough to pack in the diaper bag. I don't go anywhere without it now. I highly recommend this to anyone. Continue to clean it with vinegar to help with calcium and other mineral deposits.",5
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,This is the only Avent product that is a big letdown.  It has no on/off switch which is a huge design flaw.  I have to unplug after each use.  I must REMEBER TO UNPLUG otherwise it is a fire hazard.  Who needs to worry about 1 more thing while your baby is crying?,2
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,We've been using this bottle warmer for 3 months now. And we never had any problems with it. It works great!,5
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"I got this warmer thinking it would be much easier to use this than to boil water in the middle of the night to warm up the milk.  I tried it yesterday and was really dissapointed with it.  The fact that it will not shut off by itself, nor that it has a timer, make this an awful product.  The last thing I want to do in the middle of the night is keep my eyes on the clock to make sure I don't overheat the milk.  I returned it today and will read up on other brands to see if I can get a better one.",1
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"I've got this one and is really fast and really safe!!!I really like this Bottle warmer, the only bad this is that you have to unplug everytime you won't use it",4
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"I first purchased another bottle warmer which I promptly returned because it did not work.  I received this bottle warmer as a gift from a friend who has three children, two of which are twins.  So, I figured she knew what was good and what was not.  And she was right, this works well.  I read some of the other reviews of this product but can only say I've had no problems with this.  It's easy to use and always warms the bottle just right...not too hot, not too cold.  I'm very pleased with this product.",5
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"I love this warmer.  By the time I'm finished changing my baby's diaper, her bottle is warmed and she's happy.  I recommend this product.",5
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"I've been using this product for the last 9 years, and it has seen me through 3 kids! It has never given me trouble, rather it has been a big blessing for someone who's children have demanded milk at all odd hours of the night. I definitely recommend this product to all mothers who need to have milk at hand at the perfect temperature for their babies. However, I have not tried it as a food warmer.",5
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"I was very disappointed with this product due to the fact that the only way to turn it off is to unplug it. That is something I don't always remember at 3am. It also takes a long time to warm. I soon found the easiest way to make a warm bottle is to use my bottled water cooler, half hot and half cold and it's the perfect temp. Done in about 5 seconds, instead of 5 or more minutes. I only wish I still had the box because I would return it and get the [money] back and use on something alot more useful!",1
Philips Avent Express Baby Food and Bottle Warmer,"I got this product, it worked ok but within 30 days it broke.  I dont recommend this product!!!",1
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"With our first baby, we skipped this type of product--thinking it was frivolous.  For our second baby, we received a generous Babies R Us gift card and went to buy all the things we always felt would have been nice the first time.  I am amazed how much more organized we manage to be with this simple product.  I managed to crack the lid on the diaper area doing something stupid.  I wouldn't hold that against it though.  Plastic things break eventually.  In general, I would say it's pretty sturdy.",5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"This holds all you need and more. Great size, good quality and versatile. Worth the money if you are looking for something to keep diapers in on a crib or play yard.",5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"I have an Ikea changing station and this works great to help keep everything handy while changing the little guy.  It fits a Pampers wipe holder just fine.  There's not much more to say, if you're looking for something to organize the changing station and want a practical simple solution, this is a great product.",5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"I love this product, it has space for every diapering need.  My only complain is that the second picture shown for this product is NOT what you receive!  This diaper depot will not accommodate a wipes warmer!  That was the sole reason I purchased this product--to have a place (other than on the changing table itself) to put my warmer.  Because of the misleading picture, my wipes warmer is not being used!",3
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"Overall, we've been very pleased with the quality of this product.  It was very simple to put together and was very easy to attach to the front of our changing table.  The top caddy easily holds one of the wipes tubs. The diaper caddy holds a variety of sizes easily...we were able to double stack the newborn size diapers and easily hold several of our son's size 4 diapers as well. The containers on the side are not huge and not very deep, but they are large enough to hold a few essentials (i.e. diaper rash cream, tube of aquaphor, etc). It will not hold larger items (i.e. bottles of baby lotion that are bigger than a tube).  This isn't a dealbreaker for me, as it's just as easy to store those items in a bin on my changing table. The acrylic is pretty sturdy...it's withstood at least one drop and a few accidental bangs and hasn't cracked.My only one (very minor) complaint is that the clip at the top isn't wide enough to attach to the side of my changing table. It's a bit inconvenient to have it in the front, but the opening only fits on the front (which is presumably what keeps it secure).  It's not a huge issue, but it would be nice to be able to adjust it. Overall, we've been very please with this and plan to order another to use on our secondary changing area on the pack and play in our family room.",4
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,I got this for my changing table and it looks great. i might get another one to put downstairs on the pack and play.,5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"i searched high and low for an organizer that would fit on the side of my grand daughter's GRACO pack and play and i thought i had finally found it.  it's heavy and bulky which made it not sit straight up against the mesh on the sides of the pack and play, it kept caving in and stuff would fall off of it. i have the Prince Lionheart Wipes Warmer that was supose to fit in the slot on top of this Prince Lionheard Diaper Depot but it DID NOT! everytime i would pull a wipe out it would move the warmer out of the &#34;too tiny&#34; slot and it would fall on the ground. newborn and size one diapers didn't fit in it either because the opening is too big and two and three diapers would come out all at once, the hanging containers on the sides slide out too easily and only a small size bottle of lotion would fit it in (who even buys the small size products anymore ?) the plastic is very thin and cheaply made. it was worth it for me to pay shipping to return it. back to the drawing board!",1
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,This piece is sturdy and fits our changing table well. My husband was worried that it would look tacky but it looks fine and holds wipes in a convenient place for changing our newborn.,5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,I bought this organizer since I will use the pack and play in our living room for changes. I have the Graco basic pack n play and it does not have an attachment for diapers and supplies. This fit perfectly and holds everything I need.,5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"We are currently using a pop up and play packyard with a sleeper/changer in it for infants. This packyard grows with baby but does not have a place to store diapers, wipes, etc. This clips onto the packyard on the front and is so convenient for the storage of the supplies we need handy! Love this product!",5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,I have this attached to the pack & play in my first floor. It allows me to have a complete changing station without having to go upstairs to the nursery...very useful since I had a c-section and going up and down the stairs is not the most fun thing to do.,5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"This is a nice organizing product, but what I didn't know is that this will not work on changing tables that also act as furniture.  There is no place to hook on to.",3
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"I borrowed this item from a friend when I had my first child.  I loved it!  It stores a stack of diapers, a case of wipes, diaper cream, lotion, etc.- all within reach.  What I liked best was when friends and family came over to help out with the baby, they could clearly see where everything was to change baby's diaper.  Also, the plastic is clear, unlike a fabric diaper stacker, so you can clearly so how many diapers you have handy.Loved this item, will probably buy it for myself now that I'm pregnant once again!",5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,This does what I ordered it for. Unfortunately I had to order a replacement because it broke in shipping. Better plastic and a better mounting method and this would be 5 stars.,3
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"First--it does NOT accommodate cloth diapers well even though it says it does.  It also doesn't accommodate newborn size diapers well--I have pulled out 2-3 at a time (we used disposables for the first 2 weeks).  The Diaper Depot DOES fit on the non-dressertop unit, but it will only face the front of the Diaper Depot--so if you've mounted this on the side of your changing table it can be a real hassle (see review of the wipes warmer for details).  And the little bins on the side of the wipes holder don't hold much.  I had to wonder if they actually TRIED to fit a standard size of ANYthing in them... but the picture on their company website is accurate: the compartment holding the powder could only fit a washcloth in there with it.Now that we're exclusively cloth (and using prefolds, fitteds AND all-in-ones--none of which fit in the diaper holder) we really have little or no need for this except to hold the wipes warmer off of the changing area.  I'm guessing for someone with a bigger child who uses disposables, this would be of much more use.  And that's probably more people than not!  Thus the 3 stars.",3
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"This is the handiest device I have seen.  When we first brought our baby home, I have this attached to the pack'n'play.  Our pack-n-play had a bassinet and changing table attachment.  It fit nicely on the pack'n'play and held all the essentials.We have since moved the diaper depot to the upstairs changing table where we have the wipes warmer.  It is a very useful item and I recommend every new parent get one.",5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,Product was as described and works prefectly with my changing table.  This is a must have product.  Product shipped quickly,5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"I am a minimalist and do not like all the organizers that are insanely large.  This one holds a lot but is not large.  You can easily hold a day or two worth of diapers, wipes, creams, and lotions.  I have been using this for 9 months and I love it.",5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"My best friend recomended this to me and it was the best thing anyone could have ever done for me.  It fits nicely on the side of the changing table and holds everything I need, from all the diapers to the wipes and all the lotions and creams.  It is very easy to replace the diapers too.  Great Product!",5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"We were originally keeping the diapers and wipes on the shelf of the changing table, probably because we didn't think there was a better option. I am so glad we found this, it works and fits perfectly for our changing table.The only issue we have now is that the wipes are accessible by the child being changed, and sometimes she likes to sit up and try to grab the pack. But if this wasn't there, I'm sure she would just find something else to do that is just as inconvenient.",5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"In my last place I had the 3-way Pack 'n Play Portable Playard downstairs and the diaper deapot will attach to it very easily. So everytime I had to change her diaper I wouldn't have to go all the way upstairs to change it. In my new place I only have one floor so I though that I wasn't going to used but I found the perfect spot: It attaches to the hamper!! right next to the single bed that I used to change her diapers so I don't leave her by her own. And it keeps everything organize, the only problem is if I don't have too many dirty clothes in her hamper and the diaper deapot is full it starts going forward. But be creative and maybe you can find somewhere else to attach it too.",5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"The diaper depot is a life saver in our nursery.  It practically has become the most used item besides the diaper genie.  You cannot beat the convience of having everything all together, and especially for the price.  I highly recommend this item.",5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"I bought this to go on the changing table to hold the wiper warmer.  I already have a price lionheart ultimate wipe warmer from a previous baby  wanted to use it again.  Some reviews say that it does not fit some say it does....... well both are right let me explain.  If you want the wipe warmer to fit ALL the way down in the top part ment fro wipes it DOES NOT.  If you look at the bottom of your wipe warmer and it has little groves on it (Mine does and is about 3 years old) then the groves are mint for THIS holder.  it fits on top and the groves do hold it pretty well.  I have tried to move it by bumping it and rocking the changing table and it has stayed put.  When I first recived I was mad that it didn't fit when even on the prince lionheart website said it would then I saw the groves and tried it out.  You do have to have the wipe warmer backwards so that is alittle odd (the wipe warmer lid opens towards the changing pad not away, the plug of the warmer goes by where it hangs from hope that it makes since).  I do think it would be better if you could place it so it opens the other way.  My new baby is not born yet so I can't speak of how well the rest of it works but it seems like it will hold all the things you need and durable.  This is not my first baby so I have a good since of what will and wont work.  I will update my review if anything changes (baby is due feb 2014).",4
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"This is a cheap piece of plastic crap.  Small diapers don't fit, and only small stuff fits in the sides. Its very flimsy and so not worth $12.99.",1
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"This is a great item. Was perfect for storing diapers, wipes, brushes, balm, etc. right on the side of either a bassinet or pack-n-play. Keeps everything organized. Glad I found this!",5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"This is the perfect addition to our changing table! It has just enough space for diapers, wipes, ointment, brushes, lotion, or anything you may need at your hand's reach while changing your baby.  Would definitely recommend!",5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,This hooks right on the side of my pack and play! Everything I need for changes in one convenient place!,5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"I purchased this because it was the same brand as my diaper warmer. It is shown in the pictures with a diaper warmer. I assumed it would work....I assumed wrong. However, it does fit perfectly on my changing table and would be a nice little organizer.",3
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"When we got our changing table from a friend who no longer needed it... They gave us the Diaper Depot as well. I love how it puts everything at an arms reach without clutting the changing table. It has lasted two kids before the one it's on now, so a total of three babies. I guess like anything if it's taken care of properly it won't break.",5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"I got this item for my son.  It is wonderful,and it hung right on the end of my changing table.  I still use it and my son is 3y/o.  It has never broken on me.  I use it know for lotions and storage of odds and ends.  Definitly recommend this product.",4
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"I bought mine about 4 years ago and I do like it. It has held up well, even with constant use. It holds quite a few diapers and as long as you don't let it get down to only one left, they don't fall out.The place for wipes will hold any size container and does accomodate warmers.I have a standard changing table and it hangs nicely on the side, keeping my little guy from playing with it and keeping it out of the way.My only complaint about it is that the accessory compartments need to be bigger. They can hold the basics, but not much else. (I could only fit a sample size baby powder in it. The bigger size? Forget it.)Would I buy it again? Yes, I would, but it is so well made that I won't have to.",4
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,pFits perfectly on our changing table and keeps everything nearby. I assumed it would also fit the same brand wipe warmer but it does not.,5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"I love my diaper depot.  My daughter is 18 months and in size 3 diapers.  The diapers fit in the holder just fine and it makes changing time so convenient even with a squirming toddler.  I have a full-size powder in one side (I don't know how some people said only a trial size will fit) and diaper cream, brush, etc. in the other.  The wipes tray holds a full-container of wipes no problem (no bending or breaking).  I have it hooked over the changing table above my daughter's head so she can't kick anything off.  She gets into the shelves of the changing table and pulls everything out, but the stuff in the diaper depot stays put.If you have a changing table that will accommodate the diaper depot, I highly recommend it!!  A+++!!!",5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"I was looking for a diaper organizer/caddy for my changing station. I have an Ikea baby changing station and I needed an organizer that would hang from it, because I can't velcro something through it. That is exactly why I bought this diaper depot and I love it! Do pay attention to how wide your changing station's side is, it needs to be equal to or less than ~1.25 inches; otherwise, this diaper depot won't fit.I am able to fit some diapers in the middle compartment, place my wipes on top, and keep a few handy things in the side compartments. This allows me to use the entire space of the changing pad for my baby. Otherwise, I'd use some of the space to keep my wipes and diaper on the pad while I'm changing my baby. As she's growing, I need to be able to use the entire space for her and diaper depot helps me do just that. Love it.",5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,I think this prodict is wonderful because it saves time with everything right there at hand and gives you an easy reach for all essentials needed for changing a baby's diaper.,5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"As a new mother, I have often felt disorganized, but this product has made diaper changes quick and easy. For the first three months my daughter slept in our bedroom in her pack n play. We also used the changing table on the pack n play.  The Diaper Depot fit nicely on the side of the pnp. I keep her diapers, balmex, wipes and burp rags in the side containers.  These are the things that I needed to be easily acccessible night and day.  The Diaper Depot keeps these items neat and organized so that you can get those diaper changes done quick!!",5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"I'm sure this normally works well, but was broken on arrival.  The hard plastic makes it harder to ship.  Overall, may work well, but I'll never know.",1
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"~*My wipes warmer fits perfectly with this product. i also like that my diapers aren't exposed to dust while sitting inside the diaper depot. but it doesnt fit my graco pack n play straight, it leans.*~",4
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,We had one of these for our first child and it has held up over the last 2 years. It's the perfect companion to any changing table. Snaps right on and holds plenty of diapers and wipes and creams. Perfect price.,5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"I love this item. I bought this as well as other items for my granddaughters travel crib. There was no place to put her diapers, wipes, creams, etc. The diaper depot fits over the the side very nicely, keeps everything in reach.This will also fit a crib.",5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"We use the diaper depot for our Pack and Play playard. It's not a perfect fit, but it works, and it sure beats running around to get diapers, wipes, etc. I gave the diaper depot 5 stars despite two things:1) The opening for the diaper stacker is a little big, so sometimes an extra diaper slides out. In Prince Lionheart's defense, this may be necessary to accomodate larger sized diapers.2) The side containers could have been a little deeper.Besides these minor nuiances, it's a great product.",5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"We got this becase we were running out of space on our chnaging table. It's a great product. I can fit diapers, box of wipes, vaseline, diaper rash cream, lotion and still have some space left over.",5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"I have used this for almost 8 months now &amp; wouldn't be without it. Very convenient to have the diapers, wipes, ointment &amp; lotion all right there. Safer for baby too because everything is right within my reach &amp; I can just focus 100% on him instead of having to search for things.",5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"There is one by this same company made specifically for dresser type changing tables. I have it and love it. It is almost a necessity. Holds wipe warmer, diapers, diaper creme, hair brush/comb, some q-tips, powder, small bottle of lotion...you get it. It holds the essentials, not everything you bought for baby. Both are great, but it depends on the type of changing table you have. Or if you choose to use the top of a dresser like I did, you'll love the ""Dresser Depot"".",5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,This fits perfectly over the side of our Babyletto crib and saves a lot of space. There's more than enough room for disposable diapers and they are very easy to take out and refill.,5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"After purchasing the depot, I found it does not work well on my changing table (dresser style with fold out top). I had to put it on the side and was not pleased to find out that it is not possible to use unless it is hung. More bad news... I purchased the Ultimate Wipes Warmer, which will not fit on top of the depot while it is hanging on the side of the changing table. Perhaps these products work fine with a typical changing table, but keep in mind they do not work with a folding top dresser type.",2
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I have 2 sets of twins. With my older twins I just bathed them in the tub, but after some very close calls, (bathing 2 at a time is TOUGH and sometimes I just didnt have the patience, energy or time to bath one and than another). My husband went out to buy a tub when we found out we were having another set of twins! He came back with two of the biggest, most expensive tubs on the market! Okay they are ""pretty"" they fit baby VERY comfortably, infant or toddler. The design is spectacular, but I did give it a meer 3 stars for a reason.1. It is HUGE. I mean its really a monstrosity. It practically takes up the entire tub! So I cant even bathe them both at the same time unless they are on the floor!2.Way too expensive, I mean yes if you have one child this may be the PERFECT tub out there, but baby tubs arent a NECCESITY if you have one (or 2) kids. get a little imperfection and save the 10-15 bucks.So in my situation this tub is just not worth the hassle, and it fits in the big tub anyway so its not even that small. ANd I forewarn you, if you want a sink tub, this is NOT the one for you.",3
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I bought this for my sister for her baby shower and it's a good product. You can find babies on one end where it's smaller and toddlers on the other end, which is larger. The only drawback is that it is quite large, so unless you have alot of storage space in your bathroom or nearby, it may be a bit of a hindrance. Needless to say, my sis has a very small bathroom so not sure how much use it will get.",3
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This tub is huge!  I love it.  Only thing I would reccomend is making sure there is a small pad inside of it so that the baby isn't sitting directly on the tub itself.  Other than that, absolutely no complaints, and I'm pretty picky. :)",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","We registered for the Eurobath AFTER talking to doctors and parents, reading the reviews here and actually seeing one on display at a local baby boutique.Granted, it does cost a few dollars more than most of the other baby tubs, but you get your money's worth from the first time you use it, because you can use the same tub all the way until your baby is almost through his/her terrible twos.We also gave my cousin this Eurobath for her baby's first Christmas (born April 2005 but is the size of a 12 month old at Chrismas and probably be 18-month size at her first birthday) and she told us she either returned her other baby tubs or donated them to Salvation Army/local church, AFTER ONE USE of the Eurobath because:(1) The Eurobath is larger, it holds more water and ""cocoons"" your baby so you can actually bathe your baby without freezing your child by accident.  California can get pretty cold even with all the sunshine.  And bath time actually becomes FUN TIME for both the parent/caregiver and the baby.(2) The Eurobath is more convenient and USER-Friendly in its design and overall product feel.  And what parent doesn't like convenience?  One side of the Eurobath is meant for babies and the other side is for infants over 12 months old and/or can sit up.  Comes in ""standard color (IVORY)""  that complements whatever color theme you may have for your bathroom.  And it looks like the regular bathtub (and we all know that babies/children like to imitate adults) instead of some blue plastic container.(3) She hangs her Eurobath on the back-wall of her bath tub/shower to air-dry and store so she and her fiance can take showers - she is 6'1"" and Rod is 6'6"".  There is a hole at one end of the tub that fits most household hooks.(4) She (and we) plan to use the Eurobath as a ""baby pool"" during the summer time too.(5) The Eurobath may be large, but it is still a good size and lightweight to take on the road to Grandma's house or during weekend-getaways to hotels, etc.  But not on a plane - you will have to check it in as it won't fit an overhead bin.  Plus the airport screeners and fellow passengers will probably look at you funny.I'm glad we have more time than other folks to research and actually ""demo"" stuff that catches our eye, since our baby isn't due until March 1, 2006.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I've found the manufacturer's claims this item is ""durable"" to be untrue.  The tub literally cracked under my son's foot when he stood in it (yes, he was within the recommended age range). Fortunately, my son was not injured but he could have very easily been pinched or severely cut by the hard cracked plastic jutting out of the tub. The tub did not experience any excessive wear, other than daily baths, and was stored hanging in a closet.  I contacted Primo by email to report the incident and provided them with pix of the defective tub.  They wanted me to destroy the tub and then pay freight shipping charges based on a 30 lb. item for a replacement.  I told them I wasn't interested in a replacement if the defects in the manufacturing process hadn't been changed or improved and I definitely was not paying for a 30 lb. shipping charge when the EuroBath couldn't even weigh 10 lbs.  Here's where it gets unbelievable - after that I still am continuing to receive rude and harassing emails from some anonymous person at Primo.  Primo and the EuroBath have been reported are now being investigated by the Better Business Bureau and the Consumer Product Safety Commision.",1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",My daughter loved taking baths from the moment we put her in this tub at 6 weeks old.  (She hated all sponge baths!)  She is now 8 months old and it's still her favorite time of the day.  This tub makes bathing baby a stress-free experience -- especially for new nervous parents!  Highly recommended!,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","The item came as advertised and I really like how our newborn. It just cradles him well and I don't worry about him slipping out of the seat. I do put a towel to pad it, but that's just a precaution I take.It is a well made product, but it did have a few cosmetic blemishes (white stress marks on the plastic). Not sure what caused these but they were there when it arrived. Not a deal breaker, as it's still an awesome tub.",4
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This thing is awesome.  We've used it since my son's first bath.  (He is now 3.5 months old.)  He loves bathtime, probably because this braces him securely and keeps him in the water so he doesn't get cold.  Don't bother with those too-complicated contraptions, this streamlined bathtub is the best out there.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",We bought this tub after our son outgrew his standard baby tub because we were nervous about putting him in our deep jetted bathtub. It's been a great item and our son LOVES his baths more than ever. The way the tub is designed works out perfectly for our wiggly toddler - it ""holds"" him in place so that he doesn't slip under. The drain is my only complaint - we use this tub by placing it in our ""adult"" tub and the way the drain is situated we have to lift the Eurotub slightly to get it to drain (or place something under it to prop it up) -also: the drain cap should've been designed to open in the other direction so the natural water flow when draining wouldn't close the cap so easily. Two tiny prices to pay for a great tub - I would definitely recommend it and I would purchase it again.,4
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","We had a smaller tub when we brought our baby home from the hospital.  It worked well for a few months, but she quickly outgrew it and bathtime came with many crying fits.  The first time we bathed her in this tub she loved it.  Ever since bathtime has been enjoyable for her and us!  I highly recommend this tub!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",This is a great bathtub because it works very well for a five pound baby up to a 4 year old.  Avoid buying different bathtabs for different stages of early childhood with this truly one size fits all tub.,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I bought this tub like 2 months ago when my daughter was 5 months old.  She was getting too big for her infant tub, but I didn't want to wash her in the regular bath tub.  She loves it!  The first time I put her in she was a bit scared, I guess because it was her first time being in the water with a lot of room to play, but after that first time she got used to it.  I never realized how much she loves the water until I got this tub!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I really like the design of this tub but my 2 month old gets scared in it currently because he slips around where he's sitting. He can't slide down into the water but the sliding he does do scares him. So, a little bit of a non-slip surface for their little bottoms would make this tub pretty perfect. I plan on buying some of those little stick on non-slip fishies to remedy the problem.",3
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","As a first time mom I was very nervous about bathing my newborn,but this tub allowed me to bathe my son with both hands because the tub held him in place. He is now 6 months old and has not outgrown this tub, even though he is 23 1/2 inches long.. I had another tub and I gave it away after I received this one as a gift. Take  my advice and get this bathtub! It provides security for your child during the bath!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","someone must have REALLY known babies and mothers while designing this tub. Its so safe and secure, my son loves it!Hes 12 weeks old (Very small though, around the 29th percentile) but he loves it! We do keep a little washcloth to keep him from slipping too much, but the infant side really holds him! I bathe him on our counter (with a towel folded underneath!) and its amazing. I always wash my son holding onto him and lifting him a bit, but its really easy to get to him in this tub. like the previous reviewer, our son LOVES bathtime so we give him a little while to splash around (all while we are watching!! I usually wipe up the counter area and dry off his soap bottle and stuff!) Hes so content in this tub and I know it will last forever! My 18 month old niece is in the 89th percentile for height and she LOVED the toddler side. She had never liked the big tub (was intimidated) so her mother really washed her in a very large plastic bin (infant tubs were too small!) but once she tried this she was amazed! It is shaped so baby can sit up and splash and have a grand old time, AND they have their back to the little edge for soaps! She was so happy and nice and comfy!As for the size, we dont mind it at all. We just dump it outside, or slowly dump it in the sink, than rinse it out a little bit, dry it and put it in our laundry room (adjacent from the kitchen) I still cant see how a small apartment couldnt find room for this, put it under the sink, in a pantry/closet, under a bed or the couch, but its really not as big as many baby items out there!Its never gonna break beacause its all durable plastic. I am shocked in the ingenious design of this tub and GRACIOUSLY thank the person/people who took into consideration all the toils of bathtime with a baby/toddler!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I bought the standard First Years tub for infant, and outgrew it pretty quickly.  The Euro is large, but very clever in that it fits small baby in one direction and larger baby/toddler sitting in the opposite direction when he outgrows the laying down baby mold.  The only one I've seen that will accomodate a larger baby.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","We received a sling-style bathtub for our baby shower and our 5 wk old daughter HATED it! Before her umbilical cord stump fell off, we had to have her in the sling. Even when you are pouring warm water over them, they can never stay warm enough. Once the stump fell and we had her in the tub, she was SO squirmy and I was afraid of her slipping as I tried to hold her with one hand and wash her with the other hand - she was uncomfortable and screamed at every bath.The EuroBath is COMPLETELY different! It holds her in there so nicely, she LOVES tubby time now! I had this since before she was born but was afraid of using it because it looked so big and she is so tiny. I wish I would have used from the beginning! Since it is plastic, I keep a small towel behind her back while she is still unable to hold her head up completely just to make sure she is comfortable. I can tell this will work wonderfully for many months to come.It is large, so I don't know how well it would work if you are tight on space. She has her own bathroom, so we just keep it in her bathtub for now. I will be purchasing this for any baby shower I attend from now on! It's amazing how much my baby girl is enjoying her baths now!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",I purchased the EuroBath in Pearl White for my 10 month old niece on Amazon after reading many reviews for this and other infant bathing options. It's very pretty and sturdy and hangs up nicely on the wall with a small ribbon I attached to the handle. It fit snugly (width-ways) in my narrow 4' long guest bath. I didn't try it in my deep soaker tub in the master though (I will update in the future if we do). It's easy to clean and a great price especially considering it's good for infants up to two year olds (you just use the other end at 6 months once baby can sit up and is big enough to not slide around). My niece loved sitting and splashing and playing with her floating Duncks by Skip Hop (also purchased from amazon). My sister-in-law enjoyed having her hands free to bathe and care for her in the tub and liked the fact that baby was ""contained"" but didn't feel contained. My SIL actually commented how much she liked the drain plug too. We were able to get some great PG-Rated splashing photos that she'll have for her scrap book since the way the non-slip piece in the center hides her baby parts while she's sitting.,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","My Eurobath is the only bathtub I have purchased for my daughter.  We've been using it since she was 2 weeks old, and she is now 15 months old.  The infant side provides good support and I never worried about her slipping.  The toddler side is just big enough for her to play with toys, but not so big that she is slipping and sliding.  My only warning is that it is large.  We store it the children's bathroom tub.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This is the best tub that no one knows about.  I have struggled with washing all of my babies in the other tubs.  They are slippery and squirm right out of my hands.  The picture is hard to see, but the tub holds an infant on his/her sides and bottom.  You can turn the tub around and it will hold your baby when he/she can sit up.  I buy this tub for every baby shower that I am invited.  It is a must have for first (or fourth in my case) time moms.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Just returned home from a 2 week holiday at my brother's home in Phoenix. They had this tub and my 3 1/2 month old loved it. She kicked and laughed and enjoyed it thoroughly. We knew we would probably purchase one when we got home even though she liked the tub we had for her already. And guess what happened - our first day back home, she fussed and protested for most of her bath today in her current tub, basically telling me it doesn't cut it anymore after ""tasting the good life"". So I'm off to buy the Primo, which by the way, is much more eye appealing in our master bathroom than the bright blue one we have now.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I recieved 2 bathtubs and 1 bath sponge at my baby shower.  Not having any experiece with bathing an infant, I tried the other two first.  I tried laying her on the sponge in the kitchen sink, and she cried through every bathtime experience. I decided to try the smaller of the two bathtubs and she wobbled around, wasn't comfortable, and hated her bath.  We have to bath our children, right?  Well, this tub is amazingly perfect!  She feels so secure and LOVES her bath now.  She kicks and coos and it is her favorite time of the day.  This tub is a must!!!!  Your life will be easier and your baby will be happier!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",I had high hopes for this product after reading all the glowing reviews.This is why it does not work for us -1) Our tall (86 percentile) 7 month old fits rather uncomfortably on the side for babies 6 month and older. The protrusion to keep the baby slipping is real close to her body and she has to sit really upright and in no other position. A bit more recline is needed and the protrusion needs to be less wide.2) Our baby is always trying to stand up - and the shiny and highly slippery surface means she falls down hard. A well designed product would have a non-slip surface!3) The drain hole is tiny - takes a long time for water to drain out.Cheap - and highly over-rated. I'm looking for alternatives.,2
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","We were using a 4 in 1 tub that was a shower gift.  Well, our son out grew that in about 3 months and bathing him became a chore!  While visiting my brother's, I had the chance to use the EuroTub and was amazed at how much more comfortable my son was in it.  I had no idea how much my son loved the water until he was able to splash and play in this tub.  He's able to lie comfortably while I wash his hair (having both hand free to do so) and sit up and play in the 'pool' area in front.  It's a great design and I highly recommend it.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",We love this bath tub!  We had the First Year convertible bath tub first...horrible.  Our son slipped all over the place and you could not get all areas cleaned because of the set up of the tub.  We love the Euro Bath!  It is large enough for baby to have splash and play time without worrying about them slipping.  I love the fact that our son can continue to grow with this tub!  Don't worry about buying anything else!!!!,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",I got the PRIMO EuroBath over 2 months ago.  This is the third tub that I got. The previous two are too small for my son(he's 5 1/2month).  This Eurobath is roomy and my son loves to splash water while he's in there.This is the only tub you ever need.,4
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",Keeps our son in place much better than the other bathtub we had. No worries about him falling down into the water.,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I brought the euro-tub for my son,I read the reviews and was impressed. I had it shipped all the way to Bermuda! My son has used it since day one he is now 5 months old and he enjoys splashing in the tub. I like the no fuss clean up, and no silly sponges to ring out! It is a big tub to store, but I stand it up in the main bath tub out of sight! This was a great investment!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I really wanted to love this bath, but I don't.It is just too big even in my rather big bathroom.My baby wasn't really into this tub either.I'm still keeping it in case if we have another baby.If you are having a first baby, I would recommend using Infant Bath Seat from primo.It is easy to use, clean and store. My baby liked it better.",2
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",I love this thing. Makes the bed time routine easier for me. Baby loves taking a bath on this :),5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",Like others said the tub is very big (will not fit on your average counter top) but it is so much better than a bath seat or small tub as long as you have a sink with a pull out nozzle to fill it.  The side for young ones really does work at giving support for little ones who can not sit up. The bigger side easily holds an older child. My 2.5 year old son who is 38 inches fits in it too and loves playing in the ""boat"".  It is nice to have a tub big enough to be used for more than a year without having to waste water filling your regular bath tub!,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This is the best baby bath tub.  Our son hated the first tub he had, so I resorted to using the kitchen sink, which he enjoyed, but soon outgrew.  I read some of the reviews on here about the Eurobath and decided to try it.  Our son is 4 months old now and has been using the Eurobath for about a month - he loves it!!  He hates when bathtime is over now :)",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This is the best infant bathtub.  We had a different tub that we used when our baby was smaller-- but we outgrew it within 4 months.  This tub works great, plenty of room (allowing baby to stretch out and still be ""in"" the water, unlike the other tub we used) and has support now that our baby can sit up.  The only problem we encountered was the valve leaked the 1st times we used it.  This was a problem since we were using the tub on a counter.  After using it several times the valve does not leak anymore??  Overall I would highly recommend this product.",4
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","At first I was registered for one of the 4 in 1, transformer bathtubs until a friend pointed me to a few negative reviews I hadn't read. The one about the baby boy's private parts getting pinched and STUCK, requiring medical attention, scared me in to finding a bath that didn't have any seams or grooves or moving pinchable parts.This bath is large and doesn't fold at all, but I loved it nonetheless. I gave up the bottom portion of a hallway closet for storage, removing a shelf, and it was totally worth it. It's useful for infants who can't sit up unsupported if you use the reclining direction. Then when they're older, you put them in facing the other way and they can safely and comfortably sit up without slipping or tipping. I think its size contributes to its sturdiness and safety.Our first HATED baths of any kind for almost the first year, but even so, this bath kept her safe and supported so it made the not-so-fun task of giving a bath a little more tolerable.We loaned it out to a friend in between kids and now have it back only we're missing one of the tubes for the drain. I was going to just go to the hardware store and rig something up, but instead called the company today (PrimoBaby) and they're sending me one out, free of charge. Can you even believe it? Who (other than Medela) has customer service that good nowadays? I know it's a cheap part that probably costs them 5 cents, but it'll cost me more than that in gas for me to drive the 1/2 mile to the store to find something similar that may or may not work.In conclusion: Yes, it's large, but other than that, I have zero complaints which is more than I can say for just about any other product I currently own.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","After reading such great reviews I registered for this tub.  It never worked for my daughter.  Everytime I put her in it, she wiggled right out of the holding seat.  She was a big baby, so it's not like she was too small for it.  I just used the safer bather mat in the regular tub and she loved it.  When she was old enough to sit up I tried again, but by this time she preferred splashing in the big tub so I gave mine away.",1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Wonderful product!  Makes bath time enjoyable and fun for both of us.  Most of my friends have other tubs and prefer the sink--not me!  With a hand towel under her for cushion, she has loved this tub since she was born and now, at 3 months, is starting to kick the water and smile (so cute!)Definately a must-have!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",I bought this tub to use with my second son.  I loved it!  He did not move around like other tubs you see at the major stores.  It was comfortable for him and me.  I did put a towel on it when he was little to give him a little fabric instead of just the tub wall.  I would highly highly recommend this tub.  My son is bigger now and I was sad to let this tub go because it was wonderful.  I wish I had it with my first tub.,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","After buying several tubs for my 5 month-old daughter this one is finally a hit!  I have tried almost everything.  This bathtub works great, the only drawback is it's large size.  The best part about the tub is that I can give my daughter a bath by myself with little or no help.  It makes it easier when my husband isn't home. My daughter loved kicking her feet in the tub, whereas a lot of other tubs do not give baby any room to ""play"".  I strongly recommend this tub to any new parent.  It is very comfortable for baby.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",My son has cerebral palsy and was not safe to sit up in a regular bath tub for a long time. This tub is really large so he fit in it long past the smaller infant tubs.,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","My little boy is 3 months old and has already grown out of two other tubs.  FINALLY, I think I've found one that will last more than 6 weeks!  This tub is big enough for him to stretch out and kick his legs but the countouring doesn't leave me holding him with one hand while I'm bathing him with the other.  He loves his new ""spa tub"" and will stay in it as long as I will let him -- my husband and I are a little jealous!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I love this tub!  It has been the best item I have for my baby.  It's roomy which gives plenty of space to splash around.  The mold and shape of the tub keeps the baby secure.  Great even for a newborn.  My baby girl is now 5 months and loves to play and splash around in it.  I wish I had it from the begining, she out grew her infant tub in now time.  This item is really a must have.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","makes bath time so much easier! baby fits comfortably and safely.  My son is six months and not quite sitting up yet, but way too big for his infant tub.  He fits great in this tub- he doesn't slide around and I can easily access everything to get him clean.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",We got this tub with our second child and loved it.  I debated getting it the first time and should have.  My son was 9-2 at birth and 22 1/2"" long so I can't speak for small babies.  But I always placed a cloth diaper in the seat until he was about 4 mos old and that made it a little comfier.  I find this tub to be the easiest to clean and it never molds or mildews like the ones with pads can.  It held him in place much better than the Evenflo tub we had for our daughter.  Worth the money!,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This is a great bath, because once the baby can hold up his/her head, you do not need to support your baby in it at all. The bath is shaped to perfectly support the baby's body in a very comfortable angle for baby to relax and for you to wash their body and hair. It is a light bath, so cleaning and moving it is very easy. I had another bath before, and once I switched to the Euro Bath, bathtime became more fun for me and my son.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Our 6 month old twin boys LOVE this tub!! Finally a bath tub that fits all size babies &amp; can grow with them (unlike other brands). This is a smart design. This tub is dynamic with it's soft contoured mold design that fits perfectly under babies arms &amp; legs. It supports baby in all the right places. It's easy to fill, we simply set it on our kitchen counter and extend the sprayer hose from the faucet to fill it up. There is plenty of room for babies toys and lots of room to splash..... which for the twins creates alot of smiles &amp; squeals of delight. In fact our babies splash so much that we have to put full size bath towels on the floor just to absorb the water!!!! I've read that other parent think this is too big...we also did at first until we used  &amp; realized that it really isn't all that bad &amp; it is definitely worth it.....STILL UNDECIDED?? Here's a helpful hint ....  The tub stores PERFECTLY on the bottom shelf of the changing table. Voila Storage problem solved:)",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This is definitely the best tub.  One side for infants and switch to the other side for older kids.  I had the 4-stage bath first and got rid of it in exchange for this one.  Big enough for babies to splash around, but snug around their bodies to keep them supported.  I can never pull my 3-month old out of the tub!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I have had this tub since my first daughter was born and we used it until she was 3!!! The tub is indeed big (as others have mentioned) but that's actually great feature and you just need to get used to it. We live in apartment so it's not a big space or anything, and we keep the tub in the bathtub. Now when we have 2nd daughter (2 month old) we use the same tub. I have only once bath my baby in the kitchen on the counter (so to say to make it easier - but it was just harder). I put this baby tub in regular tub and basically fill the little tub completely (I leave the shower handle on and in the tub). So now when this tub is completely 100% full I keep my newborn under the neck and she basically floats! I don't feel her weight or anything and she can still splish and splash! My older one was sitting in this tub until she was 3 and she always had so much fun. (I would always have a LOT of water in). As soon as baby can sit put him on the other side (sitting side) and enjoy!Excellent buy, and I always recommend it",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I have to say this is the best tub I've gotten. No matter how much she squirms she stays put in the molded side.  Everything said about this tub is absolutely true.  I didn't realize how large it was until I got it and I have trouble storing it as it's so big.  But I still gave it 5 stars as it's very safe, it keeps the baby put and she enjoys it as she's actually &quot;in&quot; water as opposed to only being &quot;dipped&quot; in water.  This is a definite must have.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",This bath tub is the mother of all bath tubs. I am still using it with my third child. I've had this bath tub since 1997 and I swear by this product. It may cost a bundle but I assure you it is worth every penny.,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",I can't rave enough about this tub.  Yes it may be big but if you have the room for it definitely look no further.  My 6 month old loves bathtime and is able to play comfortably in this tub as it contours her body and allows her to move her arms around freely.  I anticipate using this for a couple of years with proper care as it seems to be very sturdy and well made.  I am very glad we transitioned into this tub.,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This is by far the best purchase we've made for our son - at 2 months old he was 16 lbs, and too big for most tubs.  This one is perfect.  He absolutely LOVES it - he kicks and splashes and has so much fun in the bath!  It's very supportive, but at the same time, he has a lot of freedom to play.  Our 7 month old nephew took a bath in it the other night, and he loved it as well.  He sat up where my son lies, and also had support and freedom at the same time.  It's too large for our kitchen cabinet, but it works well inside a bathtub.  I would absolutely recommend it to any and every parent and/or grandparent.  Just be ready with your video camera the first time you put your child in it!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Our son weighed 19 pounds at 4 months and had long outgrown his fold-up baby tub.  We were bathing him in the kitchen sink, but he slid all over.  I went searching for another tub and found the EuroBath, the biggest tub at the store.  My first thought was where to store it, but that isn't even a concern now, since we love this tub!  We just store it under his crib. Our son is secure between the three supports, we can add plenty of water to cover him just past his armpits, and there is plenty of growing room.  Take our word and spend the extra bucks; you will not regret it!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",This bathtub is perfect.  We have kids 1 and 2 years old and this tub works really well for any age from 0 till at least 3.,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",Your baby will have support with this and can lay in it alone. This means your hands will be free which is great for a quick bath if your baby is like mine and cries during the whole time.,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Wow -- where do I begin? This tub is, hands down, the very best bathtub on the market. We bought this tub before our daughter (first child) was born. We chose it based on the rave reviews of a trusted friend and the advice of NICU nurses in a baby preparation class we took. After 22 months of use, this tub is still in perfect condition and our daughter still fits in it with room to spare. This tub allows you to wash your child with at least one, if not both, hands free. The baby sits in what reminds me of a western-style saddle with the piece in front that won't let baby slip down -- even as a newborn. Our daughter's very first bath was in this tub just the way it's pictured here (no infant insert needed). She'll be 22 months-old next week and still fits in this tub. We expect she'll fit in this tub well past her 2nd birthday. Now THAT'S what I call bang for your buck.We got one of those inflatable duck tubs for our daughter's first birthday as a gift. We blew it up tonight thinking maybe we'd start putting her in the adult tub with the duck since she splashes us a lot now and soaks the walls when we use the eurobath on the bathroom counter top. To our dismay, we found that the duck inflatable tub was way too small. We assume other inflatable tubs will be too per their dimensions. In addition, the duck tub was so narrow that our daughter's bath toys would have been piled up on her lap. In the eurobath, even at nearly two, she still has plenty of room to sit and play with all manner of bath toys. She sits confidently in the eurobath because she's supported so there's no slipping and scaring her, and there's no worry for us. I can wash her hair and her body without holding onto her or worrying she'll slide and bump her head, etc. We'll probably just start putting the eurobath in the adult tub for a while now until she outgrows it.I cannot say enough good about this tub. You WILL NOT find a better tub out there because it just doesn't exist. Other tubs may have ""spa"" features or temperature devices but they don't hold a candle to this tub. You can buy a cheap rubber duckie bath water thermometer at any baby store and they work fine. This is just the best design on the market and you will thank yourself time again, probably for two years or more, for buying this tub. We do, that's for certain.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Here is what we were working with....My son is 4 months old, he does not yet sit on his own.  He loves to splash around and had begun doing this weird stretching thing that would send him slipping dangerously into the water in our Fisher Price Ocean Wonders Tub.  I was looking for something in between because he is too small to transition into the big tub.  I found the PRI Eurobath and decided to give it a try!  I love it and it was exactly what we were looking for.  More importantly my son loves it.  He still uses the infant side and he loves wiggling around and splashing, the center support provides the right amount of support for him.  I would recommend this tub to anyone that is in this transition phase, babies 3 months and up.  I have to be honest and I don't think this tub would have worked for our son any earlier.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","The ratings don't lie - this is without a doubt the BEST baby tub on the market!When our son was born, we were given the 4 in 1 tub as a gift.  Based on the poor ratings it got, I didn't even open the box.  We tried using a giant 'tub sponge' and then graduated to a mesh sling that the baby sits in in the tub.  I don't reccomend this type of product because my back was a mess, and when the baby learned to roll over, he nearly fell off into the bathwater!By then he was too big for any of the small infant tubs.  The Eurobath has been the best solution we could have imagined!  It is contoured so that my now unruly 6 month old cannot squirm his way out no matter how hard he plays during bathtime.  And it's deep enough that he's covered with water and doesn't freeze (a godsend in cold New England winters).The only design modification I'd make is a better drain.  The current drain takes way too long, and the baby is cold by the time the water level goes down enough so that I can rinse him off with clean water.  I usually end up bailing the tub out with a big cup.If you're worried about it's size or where you're going to store it, don't let that dissuade you.  I was concerned about the same thing, because we have a very small bathtub (circa 1972).  It's snug, but it fits!  As for storage, we just keep it in the big tub and remove it when we need the shower - it really isn't a problem at all.Other than the drain issue,  this tub has every feature a parent could  want!  Don't waste money or time trying anything else - this is exactly what you need to keep your baby safe and happy during bathtime!",4
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This is the only tub I've seen that will really grow with my son. He has been using it since he was three weeks old and he really loves bath time. The molded seat keeps him in place but still allows him to kick and splash with his arms. We love it so much, we bought one for him to have at grammy's, too!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","My baby is one month old and we love the eurobath!  It's spacious and comfortable, he likes being in the water, other bathtubs have a seat out of the water.  It also has a plug on the bottom which makes it easy to empty.  I love that it holds an older baby too.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",This was too big for our two month old and he was very uncomfortable. His neck is still unstable so I had to hold his neck the entire time while taking a bath rather than it whacking on the hard plastic. Also the protruding centerpiece is a good place to crush a baby's balls so watch out especially if he's too small to fit in the tub properly! I think this tub would be good for older infants or toddlers but not for our two month old. Hopefully in the future we can use it again.,2
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",I got this for my grandbaby because I only have a stall shower at my house.  This tub works very well set in the stall shower for an infant.  It would work fine in tub also I think.  Very sturdy - very nice and as baby gets bigger you turn it around.  Once they are really standing - it is not so good.  I then got the Stokke Flexi Bath Folding Baby Bath - and that works really well - she is now two and it still works well.,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Arrived caved in from shipping. If a plastic tub can't endure shipping, how can it handle a growing toddler? I had a nightmarish experience returning through Marketplace, horrible experience for a cheap overpriced tub. I ended up ordering the hoppop bath, which I love. The PRI tub certainly wasn't worth the $50 I spent. Go to Bed,Bath,& Beyond to see it in person and pay $24.99 if you really want it. I still prefer the hoppop that I purchased through Amazon.",1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",After much research I got this tub.  My baby kicked sideways from the get go.  It is quite large and takes up a lot of space.  For my newborn I simply prefer to roll up a towel and call it good.,3
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This tub is wonderful. I have a 2 month old who thinks that bath time is the best time of the day, thanks to this tub. It is big and I was afraid after reading the reviews that it might not fit in the tub of our 55 year old house...but it does.  He can sit in the tub and the infant part cradles him so perfectly, that I can have both of my hands free to bath him and play with him. I read that people said that it doesn't drain very well, usually after his bath I just pick up the tub and dump the water into our big tub and let it drain from there. Being a first time mom I didn't think that bath time would be this easy....but it is...Thanks to the Eurobath!!!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I used this bathtub from the day I brought my son home until he was old enough to climb out of it on his own. When he was really tiny we just put a rolled up waschloth at his groin to prop him up a bit more. But it was so nice that he could be supported but be deeper in the water. He stayed warmer and he was much more relaxed than when we bathed him in the standard baby tub at my parents house. As he got older we were able to let him splash and kick and explore so much more because the back is so supportive. Yes, it is a little large, but it has a drain in the bottom and we just stored it in the regular bathtub when we werent showering. Recommend it to all my moomy-to-be friends.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This tub is worth the extra money. Knowing what I know now I would have paid even more. My baby is 4 months and had outgrown the sink. I asked some fellow parents for recomendations and I got great ones for this tub so I bought it. It totally secures baby so I can use both hands to bathe her, which I feel is more safe. Plus, as an added bonus, she loved it! She kicked and splashed for half an hour. It makes the bath enjoyable for her because she can move around while being safe.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",My daughter receives services from our local infant child development program and they brought this tub over for us to try as my daughter is 12 1/2 months old (19lbs and 29"" long) and still can not sit up related to trauma at birth. Now that we are moving to a different town we will have to return the tub so I purchased our own. This tub allows her to be relaxed while fully supported and have FUN during bath time!!! I love that she is able to have a place big enough for her to be reclined in and yet a whole different side when she finally (and hopefully) can sit up! This tub truly is a wonderful product and inexpensive ESPECIALLY for how long you will be able to use it. I would recommend it to anyone!!,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","We didn't realize just how much our daughter loved the water before we had this tub.  It makes bathtime so much fun!  We especially love the freedom that this tub offers.  The unique molding cradles the baby safely, while allowing both of your hands free to bathe.  I had tried other tubs which were so much more difficult to manage.  One arm was always tied up with supporting the baby- very tiring as she sqirmed vigorously.  Also, I am amazed at the ingenious design.  No matter how our daughter splashes, she stays firmly, safely reclined.  The deeper section allows her the freedom to kick and truly enjoy the water.  At first, I had teased my husband for picking out the largest and most expensive tub.  He thought that it looked like a little baby spa.  And I thought where are we going to store it?  But this is only a minor drawback.  The advantages far outweigh any difficulty of size.  Actually, we will be able to use the tub longer since our daughter won't outgrow it for quite some time.  We think that it makes a great, indepensible gift for any parent.  A definite must for any Water Baby!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This is an excellent tub for new parents. It can be used for infants and does not need to be discarded after a few months since it can hold children up to 24 months. Although it seemed large when it came in the box, it is perfect even for use in a small apartment - it is sturdy andcan be put on a counter as needed then hung on a door or in a closet forstorage.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",Used it for 1st time today. My 5 month old seem comfortable in it. We just graduated from that 1st year tub (with sling) since he look too big for the other tub.1 less star for the scratches and dirt on the tub when it arrived. But it's good after washing. Well it's a molded plastic. Nothing fancy. Very well shaped though!,4
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Went through a couple of tubs before finding this one - our five month old loves it! It is extremely comfortable for him, and makes it so much easier to wash him - I don't need to support him, so he can just play while I scrub away!  Would be five stars were it not for the size; I can imagine it would present a storage challenge for anyone who is short on space. Otherwise, would recommend this to anyone.",4
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I absolutely LOVE this tub!  I started using this for my son when he was only 2 weeks old and weighed only 6lbs.  I just put less water in it and it held him nicely.  Now that he is 14lbs and 3 months old, I simply fill it up more.  My son loves taking a bath and I fully contribute that to this tub.  He likes to be covered with the water, something most tubs won't do considering their small size.  The only negative I would have is that there isn't a pad on the tub, so it would leave the infant's head and body on hard plastic.  What I do to take care of that problem is to put a cloth diaper underneath my son to give him a little padding and it has worked out well.  I definately recommend this tub!!!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I LOVE this tub. My husband loves the tub, and most importantly, my baby loves the tub. It's light, has a drain, contours fit the baby so she is snug and secure and it's very easy to bath her. We put it on a table to bath her and then when you're done, no lifting of tub with water, just pull out the drain hose and drain it into a bucket, then just empty the bucket. Voila! Easy! It's bulky, so store it under the crib. I've even taken it outside in the garden and let my baby have an outdoor 'swim'. Even though it's a secure tub, never leave baby unattended, even for a moment. Did I say how much I love this tub? Only complaint is with the manufacturer who for some reason won't deliver to Canada I had to send it to a friend in the States who then had to resend it to me. Annoying, that.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I like this bathtub-size better for babies because there is more room for them to lounge in, get bathed in, and feel the warmth all around them.  I prefer this to the others i.e. one that is almost as large but has a smaller insert that can be used for the infant.  More work and more surface area to keep clean.  This is practical.  It's the cat's meow!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I used this mostly in the siting up stage so it was a great size.  It's a big tub, which was fine for me because I didn't need to remove it from our xtra bathtub ever and just left it in.  It worked well into about age 1 1/2.  I kept using it because it was so great for my daughter to lean back and I'd rinse her hair perfectly.  It never molded or scratched.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This tub is fabulous!  You MUST get this!!!  I just purchased this for my 6-month old daughter, who was getting too big for the 4-in-one tub in the reclined position.  Also, for the entire time I used the 4-in-one tub, my daughter would keep slipping down and I would have to readjust her.  She did not look comfortable.  With the primo tub, all that is avoided.  I don't have to constantly readjust her and can wash her much easier.  She is definitely more comfortable now and can splash and move around safely.  I can't speak to how a newborn does in this tub, but she fits great.  And my 2-year old loves using the tub too.  This is really such a great value because you will get so much use out of it.  Highly recommended.  I wish I had this earlier.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","As the previous review stated, this is the perfect tub for a tall baby. Our 24 in tall 2 month old outgrew her 4Moms CleanWater tub and we wanted to find a tub she can continue to use as she grows. She loves this tub as she can kick her feet around with plenty of room. It seems to be made well and is super sturdy, we have been using it for a month and I can see using it until she grows out of it. Yes, it is big but we keep it in the bathtub of our spare bathroom all the time so it is not an issue. If you only have one bathroom and are low on storage space, you would probably want to look elsewhere but if you have the space, this is a must!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","It does get dirty very easy. after a week of use, you will find that the tub has black streaks on it and it's extrememly difficult to remove them. We've decided to ditch it and buy another brand instead.Also, it is just too huge....too many extra stuff in the tub. After using it, we figured out we just want something simple...just need a tub, no need to have anything inside!",1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I bought this tub because my baby was getting too big for her pink one.  Ths tub is big enough for kids up to 2 years old, has very well-placed leg braces for a one-year-old.  Before getting the tub, she would keep trying to crawl out of it.  Now, she happily plays with her floating toys in it.  Easy to clean.  My other pink SureComfort tub did not drain when I pulled the plug.  This one drains fast.  Awesome big white tub.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This tub works very well for our 5-month-old daughter. She loves to kick and splash and is very squirmy and this tub accommodates her. We tried 2 tubs before this one (including the Fisher Price tub, which is so poorly designed it's almost funny -- Baby either has to lie in that tub with a hump in her back, or if she's positioned the way I think she is supposed to be -- with her bottom resting on the hump-- her head is all the way out of the tub with no support and only her legs are in the water).My only complaint is that it is slippery -- I would have given the tub 5 stars if it had some sort of nonslip or foam backing.Still it's by far the best tub we've tried.",4
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","After reading some of the 1-star reviews, I felt inclined to add yet another rave review for this great tub. Nothing is for everyone, but the design of this is just brilliant. The only ""negative"" thing I could ever say about it is that it is indeed huge (which I put in quotes because I can see where it would be a negative for some, but was never an issue for us); we keep it leaning against the back wall of our tub when not in use & it suits us just fine there and between children we have had enough space to store it away. Now on to the good:I purchased this tub over 10 years ago for my firstborn that I was at wit's end with in regards to bathing (& I still use the same one that has been moved to 3 new homes and stored in a space that gets extremely hot and extremely cold and is still every bit as durable as when I bought it); he screamed bloody murder any time I put him in any of the 4 tubs I tried before this one, no matter what I tried doing to sooth him or make him more comfortable. With this tub, he fussed for a little bit the first time and then stopped & never went back to making bathtime a nightmare for either of us. I believe that the level of support this tub provides made him feel comfortable in a way that I couldn't even rig any other tub I tried to come close to.To be fair, I have never tried using this tub on a baby younger than 4 months, so I can't say how well it works for the very young. I took my younger 2 in the shower with me for the first few moths as that worked better for time management (& I might have been a little scarred by how much my oldest hated the tub as a newborn)! ;) However, I also use this tub much longer than the up-to-2 recommendation as I found that it saves a lot on water to fill that little tub than to get a hip-high bath drawn for a toddler and none of my kids have minded being in it still as they are older (I've pushed it to 4 years old with one child, but she was small; my oldest was still over 3 when he switched to the regular tub. My youngest isn't 2 yet & has nowhere near outgrown it).Again, no product is perfect for everyone, but I have had nothing but good experiences with this tub and would recommend it to anyone in good conscience.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This is a GREAT bathtub.  My 6 month old son grew out of his infant tub very quickly.  This tub lets him stretch out and play in the water.  The indention for his head is really helpful when washing his hair.  I have no complaints about this tub, except that I wish I would have bought it alot sooner.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This is a great tub for older babies. I think it is way too large for infants, but great for toddlers. It is a little bulky, but I just store it in the shower and remove it when in use.",4
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","My son is 7 months old...we've been using it since he was approx. 1 month. We used one of those ""bear"" shaped bath sponges to support him a little when he was tiny, but we're still using this tub and we love it! He's now able to sit up and play in it. I can see we'll be using it for a while! It's a good investment. It is large....you'll need space to store it or in our case we just keep it in the tub in our extra bathroom! You and your baby will love it!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",My daighter thinks this is a pool just for her! And the ""booty rest"" makes bath time so much easier on me!,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","you'll ever need.  We've been using this bath tub since our son Max was born.  He's now 8 months old and is using the other side where he can sit up and have a lot of fun splashing around.  We've used it with the Safer Bather since day one and have not regretted it.  If you're going to buy a tub, buy this one.  Skip the skimpy little tubs that look great but are not functional and feel unsafe for the baby.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","After reading reviews, I found that placing a towel underneath the baby and rolling it at the bottom (for better support below the baby's bottom) worked out great until she was big enough to fit better.  I had received another tub as a gift that had all these spa features but that was way too much extra work when it came to bath time.  Will also work well for camping trips in the RV.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Make no mistake, this is a BIG tub and not something you can store under the sink when not in use.  However, we are super happy with it!!  My son is 2 years 9 months (and a tall kid!) and STILL likes bathing in it!  It definitely saves water (versus filling up the big tub) and if he's happy, who am I to complain?  Highly recommended--just be sure to clean the tube that runs from the top to the tub.  I wasn't careful at first and it got mildew/mold!  Yuck!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I got this tub based on the online reviews and have not been disappointed.  My daughter started using it as soon as as her cord fell off (1 1/2 weeks).  I from the very beginning have relied on the tub to hold her in place while I wash.  Not once has she slipped out of the positioner.  The design keeps her head out of the water.  She is 3 months and has really begun to experiment with splashing.  I think the hands-free design allows her more independence to explore her bathtime, without the fear of water in her face or frustration of being gripped all the time.  Another great thing is the tub is deep, so she stays warm , which means longer playtime.  The larger size is not that cumbersome, it still fits on the counter, although by using it in the tub I can bypass the rather slow draining tube and just dump it.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",I have used this tub for my two kids and it is perfect for our needs.  We use it inside our full sized tub.  My son who is almost 3 still fits in it and I used it for my newnorn daughter as well.  The design really helps little ones stay upright when they are starting to sit.,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This is a great bath tub, I don't think their is another tub that compares to it. The only draw back is that it is hard to store because of the size, but the size is one of my favorite things about this tub. I gave it only 3 stars because you need to be aware that the shipping and handeling charge on this item is as much as the tub itself, so it ends up being very costly. There is also no Customer Service phone number only an e-mail address, so i feel the Customer Service could be much better. BEWARE!",3
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I wanted something comfortable, safe, and high quality for our 4 month old.  This is a great tub for her getting ready to sit up on her own.  It is big, and takes up almost the whole bathtub, but it beats the others since it creates her own bathtub.  There is plenty of space for her to kick and play. It drains easily and easy to clean.  For the price you will get your deal, especially the end result is a happy baby :)",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",Great tub for a new baby. Super easy to clean baby and keeps them in place. I would recommend buying a big sponge for the to lay on because the tub is hard plastic. It just makes baby more comfortable,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I had the previous version of this same tub with my older children (a hand me down). I LOVED it. Thinking I was done having children, I gave it to a friend. Several years later, chose to have another child and ordered a new tub.Improvement: This one has a plug you can pull out, rather than a tube. HUGE improvement, as the previous version was prone to mildew in the tubing, and yanking the tube to help with drainage was problematic.This tub can hold a brand-new baby. One side has what looks like a slide with sides. It actually supports the baby, and holds it to keep it from slipping. It also has a support between the legs, again to prevent the infant from slipping. Reclines a newborn slightly, since htey obviously cannot sit upright.When baby is older, seat him on hte other end, where he can sit upright.This tub fits inside any standard bathtub. I love it, works great, and recommend to every new mom!!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","When I was pregnant and looking to buy a tub I went through every review on Amazon to see which one people liked most. The EuroBath got the best ratings by far. Now after using the tub for about 6 months I see why everyone is so pleased.I have never had to bathe a baby before so I was a little scared at first. This tub's contoured bottom made it so easy! There is a place designed specifically for your baby to rest comfortably without you having to hold them. Your baby may be a little small to fit snugly at first. If that is the case, use a towel underneath them to hold them in place.The only people that should maybe hesitate to buy this tub are those with very limited space. It is HUGE! My bathroom isn't exactly spa size so I store the baby tub inside my tub. There is also a way to hang it on the wall too but I'm not sure why you would need to go that far.I don't recommend trying to move the tub when it is filled with water due to it's size. I simply fill it in my bathtub, sit on the floor and bathe my son, then when I'm done I tip the tub up and let the water drain. There is tube that you can use to let the water drain from so you don't have to lift the tub, but I find it faster just to lift it up and dump the water out.Other than those with little storage space I see no reason why anyone shouldn't buy this tub. I think the reviews themselves show how much you and your baby will love it!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",This tub is perfect! We should have bought it from the beginning. We use this for our 18-month-old who is about 33 inches long. She loves her big girl tub because there's more room to splash and more room for her toys. And we love the fact that we don't have to fill our huge tub every time we bathe her.,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",I love this tub...and so does my baby.  We have been using since the first real bath and I love that it keeps my baby nice and safe and that I can use both my hands to wash her or to splash around with her (she is now 12 weeks).  No matter how exited she gets she does not slip and we can all enjoy bath time without worry.  Right now we keep it up on the bathroom sink so that mom does not have to bend over the tub; and it fits perfectly on the double vanity.,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",i used a safety first bath system with my first born.but it wasn't the most comfortable tub.then for my second born i really did research and knew what i was looking for in a tub.it's perfect.you can use both your hand to bathe the baby without worrying that the baby would slip down.the only down side would be the size.it will not fit in the kitchen sink.but otherwise my baby and me ;we are really happy with it,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I have found this tub to be super from my baby's first bath on.  She used the reclining side until about 6 months or so, and then, when she was more comfortable sitting up we switched her to the other side.  I have a standard size bathtub in my home and this tub fits in it just fine.  The drain is a little silly, (being too slow and small for the tub)but that is the only complaint.  (If it can be called a complaint!)  I find that I can easily dump the tub out by flipping it over in my bathtub.  The only other comment is that the drain needs to be cleaned out and dried too - a pipe cleaner, cotton swab or rolled up paper towel does the trick.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","What a great gift, the baby is finally big enough to fit in the tub. The best tub around we love it",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","LOVE,LOVE,LOVE this tub. Yes, it is huge but that's the point. I live in a small apartment and my bathroom in tiny and yet the tub is still totally worth it taking up half of my bathroom space. I simply store it behind the door and just deal with not being able to open the door all the way. The first tub I used was one of those fold up tubs and I hated it. My poor baby's foot got stuck in the fold of the tub and her head would flop all over the place. I did some amazon research to find another tub and found this one.It has plenty of roomBaby's head is kept stable, doesn't flop aroundOnce baby can sit up you can put her in the other side of the tubBaby's butt doesn't slip and slide all overBuy it. You'll love it too.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This was the ONLY bathtub I purchased, based on all of the stellar reviews, and BOY was I disappointed!! My baby was only 6 pounds full-term, and this tub was HUGE!! Even with the so-called supports the tub has, she still slid all over the place, and I still had to lean over the side of the tub and hold her very carefully! She hated it and so did I, and to this day (18 months later!) she HATES the tub and we're still doing sink-side sponge baths!! If I had to do it again, I'd get one of the smaller tubs that has the sling-type support! IF YOUR BABY IS A PREEMIE OR IS JUST ON THE SMALLER SIDE, DO NOT BUY THIS TUB - IT IS JUST WAY TOO HUGE AND REALLY HAS NO SUPPORTS!!!!!!!!!!!!UPDATE: I RECENTLY PURCHASED THE MUNCHKIN DUCKY TUB FOR $15, AND I WAS ABLE TO GET HER TO CLIMB INTO THE TUB AND EVEN START PLAYING WITHIN THE FIRST 5-10 MINUTES OF HER LAYING EYES ON IT!! It's considerably smaller, has walls that go straight up (versus being slanted, like the Primo) all the way around, and I think it just makes her feel so much more secure and safe!! Should've gone with this from the beginning.....",1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I bought this tub based on all the reviews I read about it. I purchased it when my son was already a year old because he was getting to big for his smaller tub. My son loves to play in it and I feel that he is safe while bathing.  The only drawback to it is that it is enormous. It is hard to store away without taking up too much space. Otherwise, the bath tub does its job and it is easy to clean.",4
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This bath tub is humongous. It needs its own bath room.  Too big to put it on top of a kitchen sink.  Since the only place I found for it near water source is inside our bath tub, which places it practically at ground level, my back is killing me.Unless your are planning to remodel your bathroom to fit this monster, go for something else.  Definitely not for a 700 Sqr Foot apartment in the city.",2
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Great Product.Fully supported baby when small (baby was 5.6Ib) and still using it at 13 months old (two position).Grandma kept on buying different bath tubs (couldn't find this one) and got about 3 different kinds, all were too small or didn't have the baby in a good recline position, etc.At last, we got a second one online for grandma.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",My 18 month old daughter doesnt like being in the bathtub itself and she was growing out of her old tub so I bought this one and love it!! It is really big but she's a big girl. Very comfy and there a stopper that is between her legs that keeps her from slipping down. She loves it and I would recommend it most definitely. Easy to clean and durable plastic.,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I read lots of reviews before ordering this tub since mine was getting too small. I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!! My baby is 3 months old and the first time I bathed him in it he kicked like a champion swimmer. Then he went to bed and slept for about 9 hours straight!!! That is a rare occasion and a very welcome one. I am now going to bath him every night to see if it works the same :) This tub may not work well for tiny babies, but I could have used it when my baby was 2 months old for sure. It's a keeper.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","When my daugther  try to stand up she always felt and hurt her button because the plastic thing that are on the middle,tha t suppose tober there for security,last time she hurt herself really bad even that I was really close to her...",1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Ok, this is the tub you need, folks.  We started using it as soon as my son's cord stump fell off.  Alex *hated* sponge baths, but he loves his Primo tub.  The reclining position is pretty darn safe, and it gives the baby a lot of support while you wash, which is a Godsend.  Alex kicks his feet into the water, but I don't have to worry because he is held up by the raised center bumper and doesn't slip too far into the water.  The depth is perfect, too - the baby doesn't get too chilled.I agree with some of the other reviewers that the drain is very small for the product size, but really, it's not hard to just upend the tub and dump out the bath water once the baby's out.  I also like the indentions to hold the soap and bath products because keeping those in close reach is very handy.  The only real negative is the size of the Primo - it gets unwieldy when we have to take it out of the tub when company comes over, but otherwise we just leave it in the tub.I look forward to using this for many years!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",This tub was given to my mother to use when my son was about a year old.  He loved this tub.  It was big enough for him and sturdy enough to have outside baths in the summer.  We purchased this for my daughter when she was a few weeks old.  She loves it.  She enjoys splashing in it and always has a smile at bath time.  This tub makes handling a wet infant quite easy.  I highly recommend it.,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I did a lot of comparison shopping before purchasing the Euro, and I'm very happy with my choice...and so is my baby.  He's always liked taking baths, and now they can last a little longer as the molded tub holds him so I don't have to.  I can use both hands to wash him, so I'm more confident he's getting clean, and he feels safe and has fun.It's a huge tub, though - I live in Europe and have a tiny bathroom with a tub about 3/4 the size of an American one, and the Euro Bath just barely fits in the tub, and is too big to go anywhere else.  Also, because the molded area needs to be able to hold a larger baby as well, when the baby is small you still need to keep an eye or two on him and all times and adjust him in the saddle.  But because it's so big, it holds enough water to keep him warm and immersed.Great baby tub!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This tub is awesome!!  We have been using it since birth.  It's very roomy, so he'll have room to play more as he gets older.  Even though I would never leave him unattended in the tub, I love that I don't have to worry about him slipping down into the water because of the little stump in the center.  It's nice to be able to use my hands to actually wash and play with him instead of using one hand to constantly hold him up.  It's easy to empty too.  It has a drain at the bottom, but I've never messed with that. I just lift the side and dump it right into the regular bathtub.  I highly recommend this tub!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","We got this bathtub at our baby shower and still use it over a year later.  It was great when my son was a newborn - he just relaxed on the ""newborn"" side and it was really easy to give him a bath.  He is 22 months old (and tall for his age) and he STILL climbs into this thing.  Even at 22 months, I feel more comfortable having him in this tub than filling up the entire ""real"" tub and he can still kick around and play with all of his bath toys in it.  He'll outgrow it soon but this tub was excellent!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",I read reviews of EVERYTHING before I buy...and the reviews for this were right!  This bath has been wonderful for my son.  We have used this every day for ten months!,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",THIS THING IS BIG AND BULKY AND SLIPPERY WHEN WET. BEST ONE IS Summer Infant Mother's Touch Large Comfort Bather,1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This tub is perfect for the baby. My 4 month old fits in the tub so I can have my hands free to bath him. At first I thought it would be too big, but I am very happy to have it. I highly recommend it.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","we LOVE this bath.  We received a different baby bath during our baby shower and our daughter quickly great out of it.  This is great because when she learns to sit up all the time, we can switch her on the other side and keep using it she gets older!We stick this inside our jacuzzi and it fits perfectly.  It's wide enough to fit her and easy to clean.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This bath tub is large but it's fantastic.  It's so easy to give our son a bath in this tub and he seems comfortable.  We gave our son a bath in my niece's tub which is much smaller and this tub is so much better.  After using it, we don't want to use anything else!  I also love that we can use it for so long - a great value!  It will also save on water instead of filling up the whole tub.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I wish I had had this bath tub for my first child 7 years ago, and my second 5 years ago!  This is a tub that, if you are planning to have more than one child, is especially good because it doesn't have any pad to get moldy or time-worn.  We got it for our third baby, who is now 2 months old, and even if we don't have more children it has been well worth the money and extra space it takes up.  It really isn't enormous, just larger than the other tubs, which frankly I was frustrated with until the babies were at least 4 months old, only to have them outgrow it 2 months later!.  This one works well from day one, even for ""sponge baths"" when they're newly hatched.  The contours are great no matter what Baby's size, the tub is very easy to use and clean, and no great bother to store.  I am looking forward to using this bath when she's able to sit up - I won't have to put her in the regular tub and break my back & neck trying to reach her, wash her, and keep her slippery self from sliding around, while hoping she's enjoying her bath time!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Our son is now 15 months and he is not even close to outgrowing this tub.  The infant side of the tub is great and was always very secure for our son when he was younger.  Who cares about padding; at least your baby is actually in the water, securely without getting cold. It's much better to fill this tub up with water rather than wasting water filling an entire tub with only a few inches of water. We will be using this tub for several more months.  We love it!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This bathtub was recommended by one of my best friends, a supermom, and I am so glad I bought this on her advice!We've been using this tub since the little girl was a little under a month, and at first I needed to be more supportive of her as she'd squirm and start to slip one way or another.  But already at just 3 months she lays and splashes and plays in the little molding and we can float a duck around at her and clean her so easily as it supports her.  I love that we'll be able to keep using this bath as she grows into this little baby spa.The material is durable, the molding perfect for a little baby and the features are practical.  There is a max fill line and a little drain, though I really just flip it over after we bath her in our tub.  The biggest issue is storage - it would never have fit in our old apartment.  We leave it in the tub, flipped up to dry.",4
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",I went through two other tubs before I bought this one.  I didn't buy it until my baby was 6 months old and could sit up on her own.  My daughter loves it and so I do.  There's lots of room for all of her toys and it's easy for her to sit up without being confined.,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I have to say that this tub is great.  Before this tub, I purchased a few of those smaller infant tubs only to realize that they could not grow with my baby.  I love this tub because it is large enough for my 18 month old to splash around and be comfortable, and also because I don't have to bathe her in my big bathtub which has sliding glass doors.  It is so roomy that I even put my other daughter, who is 7 months, in the tub and bathe both of them at once.  The only drawback is storing the tub, b/c it is large.  Definitely worth the price for all the use you will get out of it.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","After using a different tub and hating it, we bought this one. This tub is great, works for newborns and up! We love it and both our daughters have loved it! Thanks heavens I found it!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This tub is great!  Its totally huge.  My 3 month old loves to kick and splash in the bath.  I started using it at 1 month and bath time has never been better.  I used a smaller tub to begin with because this tub seemed alittle to big for a newborn.  It has a contoured seat that keeps him from sliding down in the tub.  My baby seems very comfortable in this tub, I highly recommend it.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I read reviews before I bought it. It has very good reviews. After I bought it, I agree with all of them. Excellent bath tub, only problem I have is that this is so big it cannot fit on small sinks. I don't think it is a huge problem.",4
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","After using a smaller plastic tub and a blow up tub, this one is the best!  I only wish I would've just bought this one to begin with.  My little guy is 6 months old, 24 pounds but can't sit up yet.  He still uses the side that lays him down in the water, and he loves it!  Don't waste your money on other tubs, this one is the best.  This one will grow with your child while saving water too!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","After dealing with a couple of unsatisfactory baby tubs, I found this tub for my infant twins. It is, hands down, among the best baby gear purchases I've ever made. Can't say enough good things about this product. The smart ergonomic design keeps your baby sturdy and safe, and allows you to have both hands free for washing and grabbing bath products and towels. YOU WILL LOVE THIS TUB!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Without question the most well-designed and well-functioning baby bath I have yet tried.  My daughter is 9 months now, and we have gone through four different baths during the past few months -- one doesn't keep her stable; another doesn't have enough room; yet another does not stay stable, etc...This tub is roomy, yet holds the child safely in both the reclining and sitting positions.  My daughter is 27 inches long, and can still fit in the reclining section, securely held in place, when she prefers to recline for her bath.  She can also sit upright at the other end, with good support around her torso and at the pommel between her legs with enough give to splash around.  Simply put a rubber bath mat under the tub to keep it firmly in place in your larger bath tub.  I highly recommend this product.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I would recommend this tub for those with the extra space to store since it is quite large, it can be left in the regular bathtub when not being used or hooked onto the wall.  Good for babies that are too big for the infant tub and too large for the big tub.  I have been using it for 4 mos+ and will continue until I can use the larger tub around 8 months, this can also fit into the large tub if you would rather fill this instead of the full tub at that time.  I have been happy with this.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Used the same one for 2 kids. It's a little bulky, but I tried several others, and this one is the best of all. My kids could sit in it until 3 years old! Great product!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","My little one is very tall (just outgrew a 6-month one-zy at 3 months) and this bath is great: he can lean back as he can't sit yet, and there is plenty of room for when he can.  If you find other tubs are just too small give this one a try.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Everyone thought I was nuts registering for this tub but once they observed how comfortable my daughter was just a few weeks old until now (7 months) they realize it was one of the best investments I made.  The arm rest held my lil newborn in place just right and allowed a nervous new mommy to awww and ohhh as I bathed my daughter with BOTH hands.  Now that she's sitting up the tub is great...large enough for her to play but not so big I have to worry about her harming herself.  It is a bit bulky and won't fit in my regular tub, however, I sit it on top my kitchen table and allow her to enjoy her bathtime.  (its alot easier on the back as well).",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I first saw this item in a popular baby catalog, and asked my friend to give it to me as a shower gift while pregnant with my first baby, back in 1996.  8 years and 4 kids later, I still have the tub, and love it!  Now that my youngest has finally grown out of it, I hate to give it up after so long.  This is the best tub on the market - it grows with your baby, and it's very durable.  The only downside was not being able to use it while newborn, as the baby was too small and he was able to slide downward.  I used it after the first month (once I was no longer sponge bathing), and placed a folded towel inside it for padding.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","If you're looking for a tiny bathtub for your itty-bitty newborn baby, this might not be what you had in mind.  It's big.  It's not the sort of bathtub you plop in or on top of your kitchen sink (unless you've got a pretty big sink and you're very tall).  I actually use this inside our regular bathtub when bathing my daughter.  I used a bath cushion to give her extra support and comfort on her back/head when she was unable to sit up on her own.  And though she's able to sit up now, using this bath makes so much more sense than filling up the regular bathtub (which would require way more water).  I definitely foresee myself using this bath for my 7 month-old for several more months, and possibly a couple more years.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","My little one has plenty of room to kick & splash.  Design also helps to keep her from slipping to far in the water while keeping her head above the water line.  Only downfall is the arm rest are a little to high, but overall we love it!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Before my son was born I bought him fisher price bath tub. I liked to look at it, and imagined how I would bathe my baby in it. So the time came, and Nick was born 9 lb 4 oz. Huge?! Oh yeah - he was too big for his tub. And bathing him was such a disaster :( especially when he started to jump out of it. I couldn't bathe him alone, my first hand was busy with holding him and the other one was shampooing. And my husband was showering. We tried to switch to an adult tub, but as he can't sit yet it was even more uncomfortable: my back ached, the baby was scared, and I was nervous.When my son turned 4 months, he weighed about 20 lb I couldn't wait anymore, and again searched net for bath tubs. All I saw was about same size as fisher price. Finally after googling ""my baby doesn't fit his bath tub"", I found an advice from woman who recommended trying primo eurobath, date of her advice was 2001, but anyway I tried to amazon it and found it to my great surprise. After looking at customer photos I understood this is exactly what I need.So it came, I cleaned it and we tried it same evening: Nick was so happy. He was sitting like a king on his throne in it. Primo is designed so well, like it was created just for the shape of my baby. It has space for his hands, bump doesn't let him to jump out, it's pretty high, and it also holds well.Our bathing time became much longer. The baby was very happy, smiling all the time, and kicking the water. Mommy was relaxed for the first time, and really had fun :)))",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I was looking for a bigger tub since my 6 month old son had already outgrown his infant tub and I wanted something that was versatile enough to support him leaving my hands free since he has not yet mastered sitting up by himself. We tested it out and he seemed to really enjoy it since his feet were immersed and on the same level as the rest of his body unlike his previous tub. Also, the molding was great as it allowed him to lay back without letting him slip under water. The tub seems big enough to hold him until he hits toddlerhood and the size is great as it still lets us use enough water to immerse him, yet less water than filling the whole bath tub. The only thing I would have liked is for this to have a non-slip mat or foam pad like the infant baths do. Although he doesn't slip around, I would like to have his head cushioned as sometimes he tries to get up and does not have enough control to lay his head back down gently, so he sort of bangs it against the tub. Also, I think the draining process could be improved upon as it's quite a pain to have to assemble the clear plastic tube between the drain from the soap dish and the drain from the tub - drains very slowly as well and does not drain completely unless you just tip the tub to let the water out. They could have just put in a tradition plug on the tub floor that changes color when the temperature gets too hot; along with a foam pad for the baby's head - then it would be a five-star product.",4
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","We bought this because of all the positive reviews, but clearly we should have spent more time looking at the less than stellar reviews. I just opened this and it's a behemoth. On what planet can you hang this on the back of a door? If you have ANY STORAGE space issues at all, this is not the tub for you. You couldn't hang this anywhere in your living space without it being on the way somehow. It's very deep so I just can't see how you could put it behind a door (except perhaps a door to a basement). We've to return it because there is just no room in our condo to store it.",3
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I love this bathtub. I bought it for my daughter and used it until she was 18 months old. It is a great size and fits nicely in the tub. I bought a soft insert for the short amount of time she was very small, but otherwise it was great without an insert. And with the molded upright side, when she got big I could sit her in it safely and not worry about her slipping under the water, but she still had plenty of room and water to play. I wish I had had one with my first two. Must have!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I received the sure deluxe newborn to toddler tub at my shower, But my little girl outgrew the newborn side at 3 months, but was to small for the toddler side. Here bum would pop up over the plastic part that is suppose to keep her from going under. I  bought this tub and it is great! It is the only tub where she has been able to kick her feet and it holds her so i can bathe her with two hands. It is big, but fits perfectly in our tub and gives her so much room to play around. It has made the both of us so happy i only wish it was padded, but other then that it has been great!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",We bought this tub for my son after buying 2 other bathtubs & we absolutely love this one. This bathtub is a lifesaver. We never had to worry about him slipping into the water. He is safely cradled in the tub's unique design and form. The molding on the infant side allows him to lay back & relax during his baths. We also like the easy draining tube. Bath time is now a joy. Storage isn't a problem at all as the tub has grooves on the backside where you can hook the tub on your bathroom wall or onto the towel bar. A definite must-have product for your baby!!!,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",we have had two other tubs and disliked them for size or function. This one is great. It is huge!!! He will not out grow this one. I did find the tub slippery for a newborn. but I have a foam bath mat for him and cut it to fit. I feel more comfortable now. It was a $3 fix. I already had the mat from his last tub. I think you will be really happy with this tub. I love the green too.,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",Great product!Ive only used it a few times with my 4 3/4 month old daughter and It's wonderful compared to all the other baby tubs I've tried!Totally recommended!Nice looking too!,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I got this for my baby shower and I LOVE-Love-Love it.  I put it on my kitchen table after filling under sink, and drain it from the easy-drain spout right into the sink when I am done.  My baby Amelia has been in it since week 1 and she is 3 months and still loves it.  She fits perfectly in the newborn side, and I feel safe she won't slip down.  I can easily bathe her alone without problems.  Highly recommended, especially since the tub grows with you and your baby.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I'm convinced this is the best tub out there for young children. My daughter is small for her age, but she still uses this tub. She hates having water in her face, so the reclining side is perfect for shampooing and rinsing. Then she moves to the other side and sits up for the rest of her bath. It's only now getting a bit snug for her. I would never buy any other tub. It took me four tries to find a good one and this is it.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I saw a lot of reviews about this product on amazon and decided to get it.  My baby is now 14 months old, I have used it since day one I brought her home from hospital.  I feel so safe when I put her in and hold on to one of her arm when I turned to side to get her toy or shampoo.  I know she won't slip because of the design, just never leave your baby in the bath tub alone. I am glad I bought it and since it is big enough, I don't have to worry her out grow it.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Before I gave birth I received a smaller blue infant tub that is generally pretty popular and widely available. I loved it for my newborn, it was small and compact and easy to place over the sink.  However by months 3 it was clear the tub was far too small for my son, even though it claimed to be for toddlers as well.  So we decided to get this one, it is far superior to the previous one.  Though this one does not come with an newborn insert I find the tub itself is so much smoother, softer and more comfortable for the baby then the previous one.  The laying down part is still being used at 7.5 months.  I think it will probably be used for quite a while, since it is easier to lather him up in that position.  The tub itself is large but the bottom is proportioned enough to fit over a nice size sink.  I should have purchased it first.  I am very happy with it and highly recommend it for your newborn, infant or toddler.",4
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",Have enjoyed it for the last 9 and half months. Need to make sure not to fill it too much but there is a line to show you.,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",This is an awesome tub. It's huge so Lo can stay in for a lot longer than most tubs. My daughter loves her bath time and her tub. The seat thing is great and does a good job at keeping her from slipping when I lay her back.,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",I thought this would be better than it was. This thing is huge. And I thought that the area for the smaller babies would be great but it wasn't. It made it hard for me to hold my son and clean his lower body.  He slides around even with a towel under him.  I later bought a bath pillow for him to lay on in our regular tub(safer bather) for less and he is happier in it. Not to mention the clean up is so much easier in a regular tub than this thing.,3
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I bought this bathtub before my son was born because the reviews were excellent and the price was right.  We have absolutely lovedthis tub and wouldn't dream of using anything else!!  It safely held my son and he loved every minute of bathtime! I have recommended this tub to all of my friends and family, it is a must have!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Love this tub for my 8 month old. She had outgrown her washpod tub (which she also loved) but I wasn't comfortable putting her in the regular bath tub yet since she is such a squirmer. This tub was a hit right off. She loves it, there is plenty of room for her to splash around and it is really easy ton wash her.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","We love love love ours. We have used for two years, and it is in as perfect condition as when we bought it. No sharp edges a fabulous size, and easy to clean. It is also more attractive than many others we looked at. Could not be happier.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Once baby had outgrown the sink, we were stuck using the one I originally registered for - a ""space saving"" model. HATED that one. Too much work. Read reviews and bought this one - baby is now 15mos and we are still using it. LOVE it. One tip - for small infants, use one of those big sponge things to keep baby from sliding around, or put a wet handtowel behind them. Oh, and I use to store it on the back of a door. Used one of those stick-on-hooks to hold it up. Worked great, out of the way & able to dry out. Buying this for all of my girlfriends for their baby showers.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This is a great tub for baby! I didn't use it for my infant, I think my baby was 5 or 6 months old when I started using this but I really liked it!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I love this tub and so does my son!  Up until I got this tub, he ""tolerated"" bath time.  The first time he bathed in this tub he actually laughed!  It is nice and deep, so he can splash & play.  The saddle-like horn in the middle kept him from sliding even before he could sit up.  He is now 10 months old, and we both still love it.  I only wish I had gotten it earlier.  Note: it is very big- but I use it in our master bath so I don't have any problems with the size.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I love this tub!  My one month old loves it too.  I purchased this tub based on several reviews about babies loving it.  I think my baby loves his bath time because he is able to sit in a good portion of water, so he doesn't get cold.  The only thing I don't like about it is that there is no cushion/padding for him.  He's so small that he somewhat falls to the side, but I have been putting a towel down first for him to sit on, which helps a great deal.  Regardless, it is a great tub, and worth it.",4
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I love this tub! It is great! My daughter moves around a lot and it has kept her in place! The only reason why I didnt give this a 5 is because it lacks something soft for her head.  I now put a washcloth behind her head but it would have been great if it came with a detachable soft pillow type object.  The plastic is just very hard and left her head red after the bath.  Other than that, its great!",4
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This is my 2 month old daughter's jacuzzi. I am a first time mother and I was so afraid that while bathing my newborn she would slip out of my hands, but with this tub, I just place her in the infant side of the tub and both of my hands are free! She also loves it! The best thing about it is that the other end of the tub can be used for toddlers, so I really get my moneys worth. I did a lot of research and this is the best tub out there. I strongly recommend it!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I've been really pleased with this bathtub. My large (20 lbs.) six-month-old son still fits really well in the side that reclines, and he loves to lean back and splash his feet in the water. The tub supports him well enough that I'm able to free up my hands for washing and playing, instead of just trying to support him. He would have outgrown other tubs months ago, but I expect that we'll be able to get several more months of use out of the Eurobath once he's able to sit up well enough to use the other end.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Dunno, I had this tub, and it was monstrous.  I hated it for my newborn, probably used it twice, then put it away till she was around a year and could use the situp side.  I could see getting excited about it for older infant/toddler.  I felt secure turning my back on her because she was well supported.  There is no easy storage solution for this behemoth; the thing basically lived in one of our bathtubs.  It didnt't survive for my second, not that I would have really used it if it had.  I think it fell from a shelf and the bottom cracked.  So not that durable in the end either.  There are better ways to bathe an infant.  I loved the leachco safer batherLeachco Safer Bather - Infant Bath Pad - Blue Fish.  Euro tub was not for me.",3
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","It is easy to give your baby a bath in this one!  Baby stays nice and warm. After all, in a bath the baby should be IN the warm water, not above it. I tried the fold-up model from safety 1st (shower gift)--what a loser. The bend in it put baby in a contorted position (infants can't straighten  themselves). AND IF YOUR BABY HAS REFLUX, try to choose one with no bends. This one is perfect, and it's impossible for baby to slip.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","product is good, but it look like already been used..., so better watch out it's real new or not....so PS",3
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I love this tub and have bought 2 extra to keep at each set of grandparents' houses.When my son was an infant, we used one of the sink tubs.  The sink tub was great because I did not need to bend over and break my back, but he quickly outgrew it. At 6 months old, we transferred to a bath seat.  We used it for several months with no problems, but then we moved to a new house.  The bottom of the tub was bumpy and the suction cups did not stick well.  One of the first nights in the new house, my son flipped the bath seat over, and then the suction cups stuck to the smooth surface of the tub's side wall, pinning him under the water.  I was in a panic, but luckily I was able to release the suction and pull him out.  I was never so happy to hear him gasp for air and cry.  We immediately threw out the bath seat, and began looking for an alternate solution.  Then, we found the Primo bath tub. My son still is using it a 24 months and has a great time splashing around.  It is the perfect transition from a small sink tub, to the big tub!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",easy to use and store.  make all bath experience comfortable for both: mom and baby.,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This is a wonderful bathtub for baby!  I have been using it with the Safer Bather since my son was first able to have baths.  The only suggestion that I have for this tub is that they should put a rubber or sponge padding in it.  When I put my son in it for the first time without the Safer Bather, he slipped all over the place and didn't like it (he was 3 months old at the time).  There's just no traction in it once you put the water in it.  So I ""downsized"" from the Safer Bather and bought a sponge pad. that I now use in it and he doesn't slide around anymore and can enjoy splashing around a bit (which he couldn't do with the Safer Bather).  He has always enjoyed his bathtime, but I know I would enjoy it more too if I didn't have to worry that he was going to slide around in it so much!",4
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",nice and big better than expected. . . . . . . . . . . . . .. .,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I like how the product got here on time and its exactly like the picture, I thought it would be nice for it to have a mattress or cushin material and its lacking that,,,I guess I have to get that separately to make it comfortable for the baby.",4
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I bought this tub for my daughter's twins.  She loves the tub and the way the children sit in it.  However, her twins are still very small, 5 to 6 pounds and she says it is a little big for them.  It would probably work  better for babies weighing 8 pounds and over.  Other than that she says she plans to get lots of use out of this tub!  Very sturdy!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I will not waste your time echoing all of the fabulous things that have been said about this tub by others before me.  I give it 5 stars - enough said.  Many of the reviews are from parents with very young babies.  I'd like to give a perspective from a Mom with an older baby:I have used this tub since my son's very first bath.  He is now 18 months old and this is still the only tub that I've had to buy.  He still fits in it just fine, and I still use the lay back side to wash his hair.  Then we simply turn around to sit on the larger side to splash and play.If you're looking for a tub that will last you for the long haul, this is the tub for you. I'm not looking forward to giving up the security aspects of this tub when my son outgrows it.  I'll try to keep using it as long as I possibly can.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","We are about to get rid of ours after 3.5 years and 2 kids.  It was great from the time they were tiny brand new babies to about six-months-old(which is when both of our kids sat up well enough to move into the regular bathtub). The formed curves and rests are perfect for various ages and even sitting directions. I always loved that there were no parts other than the plug.  So simple, smart, and affordable.  Oh, and in-between kids it just sat outside on our patio except for when we used it to hold beer and ice for parties.  Even after all that it was still in great enough shape for the next baby and, now, to be passed on to others.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I used the safer bather (and liked it) one time before going to the EuroBath. I used the safer bather in the EuroBath when my sons was very small, and within a month or two just used the EuroBath. I love this tub. The main reasons:1. Uses alot less water than the bath tub2. Has a position for all age babies and toddlers, which will save money because you don't have to keep buying bath products and again it save with the water bill (My son still used the lay down position)3. Has spots to hold things while I am re-adjusting my son4. Has easy drain plug5. plastic so you can dry it quickly and put up elsewhere if other members of the family use the tub.6. White color so you can remove things floating around in the bath water, and you can easily notice things such as bug bites and such that need your attention on babies skin. (i am a paranoid mother! :))7. Once you get your hands on it you will see that it is built to last. There are no plastic cheap parts to break or wear out. It is one solid thick mold. That means a whole lot to me.The only bad thing about this tub is that it is large. I like large because I know I will get my 25.00 out of it since I will be able to use it for several years but again it is a pretty large item.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I normally don't have time to write these reviews, but I am making the time for this one.  This tub is awesome.  My son was bigger from day one.  He had another infant tub that only lasted about two months.  Now at 9 months old and weighing in at 26 pounds and very long as well, this tub is still great.  Owen didn't really care for bath time until we started using this one.  The first time we put him in he laughed and splashed around.  Also, because the tub is bigger, he stays warm in the water and bath time can be a little longer for play time.  Owen gets his bath at the same time everyday now and if he doesn't he gets fussy, but as soon as he sees the tub, he gets excited!  This is worth the little extra.  I will be keeping it for baby number two and recommending it to all of my friends!  Its super sturdy too.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This tub is great!!!! I only discovered it when my little guy was 3.5 months old and we bought one in Italy for our second home there. It holds the babies snugly and securely on their backs and when ready to sit up  even better. My boy is now 14 months old and he still has plenty of room to play in. I also use on the bathroom counter and fill it w/the spray nozzle from the shower and then unplug the drain tube into the sink, therefore no HEAVY lifting. We are expecting another baby boy in 3 months so I will be donating my other tub to charity....",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",There is no better tub than this!  I love the fact that it is molded to prevent slipping.  Now I can use both hands to wash my daughter without fear of slipping.  This tub holds so much more water too. Bath time is now an enjoyable experience rather than something to be dreaded.  I HIGHLY recommend this tub!,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",This is a wonderful tup for my little guy to bathe in.  It is quite large so that is my only negative.  It's almost too big to put into a bathtub but it does work great on a kitchen counter if you have the space. I can tell my little one loves it and is very secure in it.  I have had since he was a newborn and he is now almost six months.,4
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I recently purchased the Primo Eurobath and it is wonderful.  I was a bit concerned after reading multiple reviews stating the bath was too large.  Although it is larger than most baby baths on the market, I wouldn't say that it is too large.  I have 8 month old twins and wish I would have purchased this sooner.  The tub is large enough for them to splash in and I am still able to use the 0-6 month side of the tub which gives me more flexibility to use my hands (wash hair, etc.) than a standard baby bath.  If you are on the fence about this product I highly recommend purchasing it.  I'd rate it one of the top five baby products to have!",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","We just bought this bath when our son turned about 5 months because he was outgrowing his 'conventional' baby bath.  We're also in a unique situation in that we have a very large tub that we bought as part of a top to bottom bathroom remodel.  I don't like having to buy new gear every few months just because our son outgrows it.  This tub will clearly last our boy until he's at least 2.  I wish we had gotten this when he was born because it would have made all the early bath-time struggles disappear.  The tub is very large and I can see how people would struggle in a standard tub.  For now, this works for us.The one piece of feedback/improvement I have, is that our son hasn't mastered sitting balance and when he gets excited, he'll fall back and bonk his head.  We bought one of those foam baby tub inserts and it sits right about where the baby's armpits would fit.  So, now when baby falls back, his head hits the foam before the hard plastic.  We could probably cut the foam so that it would sit more snuggly, but we haven't gotten that creative.  The makes of the Primo baby might want to consider selling something like this as an accessory, too.",4
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",After I read the reviews here I bought this tub and was so glad I did.  My son is 9 months old now and is in the ""sitting"" end of the tub.  It cradled him perfectly from his first bath and I expect it to last until he's big enough to handle the full size bath.  My friends who got other baby tubs have all had to buy another larger one or one of the baby seats (which they say don't work).  I'm giving this tub to all my friends who are having babies this fall - I'm certain they'll love it as much as I do.,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","Absolutely loved this tub; it was first purchased when my son was 5 months old - Summer 2007.He used it for approximately 4 years before giving it up...he loved this tub - he just grew out of it.He had countless hours of bathroom fun.Tub was extremely durable - we moved from Massachusetts to Virginia and it survived the trip and the nmovers.  Them stopper still works and the tub endured a 40(+) pound active child using it on a daily basis.Relatively easy to clean with bleach or cleaning solution.Due to large size the tub was stored in regular bathtub.PROS: Endurance, minimizes slipping risk and less overall water usage.CONS: Bulky - will not work well for someone with limited storage.  This tub is ideal for family with an additinal bathroom.I would and have definitely recommended to a friend.",5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",We had tried two different tubs until we finally got this one.  Our baby is very much a squirmer and would always slide past the little hump on the other two tubs we had (one was a Babies-r-us brand and the other was the First Years infant tub)  While the sling worked well until he was around a month old from there on out we constantly had to hold onto him so he wouldn't slide down the incline past the hump.  This one we don't have that problem and he still splash around like a mad man.  I don't know if the sitting up portion will be quite as comfortable but the couple times we've had him there he seems to be fine as well.,5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"Take the time to figure out this gadget - its worth it.  But a word of advice - regardless of what pail you buy, wrap up your diapers - with the wipe inside - using the velcro tabs.  They smell less and are easier to dispose of.  Not to mention that an open diaper is difficult to manage and unsanitary.  Wrapping them up might also prevent &quot;getting poop on your hands&quot;, as one reviewer bemoaned.  Lastly it keeps the pail clean and odor free.We've used our genie for three years (2 kids) and it never occurred to me to wash it.  When used properly the diaper never touches the pail, only the plastic.",4
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I tried the diaper champ at a friends house and HATED it, the diapers kept getting stuck in the flipping thingy. So, when it was time for me to get a diaper pail I chose the Genie. Honestly, it is very easy to use and it does control oder. However, my biggest problem with this is the first few diapers I put in always come untwisted. It really bothers me, I have to keep cutting and retying the bag. The only way I have found to reslove this is to make sure the first three or four diapers are very light and then to twist the Genie four or five times. Other then that it has done everything it is promised to do. Despite the problem I have with mine I would still buy it all over again if I had to.",4
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I don't know how I should review the Diaper Genie.  It beats throwing diapers away in the trash can, but I've never used another brand of diaper pail.  I registered for the Diaper Genie because it's such a name brand.  But 4 months into this, I've run into a few problems.  It's easy enough to use, but the first 2-3 diapers you drop in untwist and fall into one bag.  That bottom bag can get so heavy, that you lose the ability to twist future sections.  I've actually had to reach down and pull diapers out and start again.  Also, while replacing a refill, a little plastic tab that secured the ""child proof"" lid broke, and now the entire top pops off with little effort.  And, a plastic tab holding the bag cutter onto the lid broke off, so we lost the convenience of hanging the cutter where you can find it.  I know nothing's perfect, but I think I'll go with another brand next time.",3
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I love the Diaper Genie, it has worked wonders! Before we used it the nursery would REEK with messy diapers!Yikes! but after we started using the Genie...the room was delightful and it's soooooo easy to use! I highly reccomend this to mommies and daddies everywhere!",5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"Be wary of any diaper pail that requires instructions and a demo by your next-door-neighbor in order to use it!  After I figured it all out I found that it was a pain to fool with.  Also the refills are expensive and it doesn't hold enough diapers IMO. It doesn't lock out odors either.  It may have for the first week or two, but now at 3 1/2 months it SMELLS BAD.  I guess the diapers have gotten stinkier.  What can I say?The other thing that drives me nuts is that the first few diapers I put in after a refill change never go in correctly.  No matter how many times I twist after the first diaper, the second one always pushes right through the first twist and ends up hanging in the bottom - un-sausage-linked.  The only positive thing I can say is that when you do cut the links loose they are easy to dispose of in the outside garbage.You may want to save your money on this one and go with something less fru-fru.",2
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I got one for my baby shower and I figured I'd give it a try. It worked fine until we had to change the bag for the first time then my husband, who can manage to put together computers and Playstation 2s, couldn't figure out how to get the dang thing to work again. We now just use it as a garage can... don't waste your money, just buy the Diaper Champ.",1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"SAVE your Money!!!!  It's a good idea but truly not worth it. You are better off just buying a small-medium size garbage pail with a lid.Pro:  It does keep the odor from escaping and has a clean appearance.Con:  Doesn't hold too many diapers, hard to assemble and hard to change the refills.",1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I thought that this would be the greatest addition to my nursery.  I was completely wrong.  If you don't put the diaper into the unit correctly, you can forget it working properly.  Sticking your hand half way down and trying to get it to seal was completely fustrating. After three months, I threw it in the trash.  I found the Diaper Champ to be a great addition and an end to my fustration.",1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"The diaper geenie would be wonderful if it actually worked like it is supposed to.  The refills smell good - THEY ARE SCENTED PEOPLE!Everytime I empty the thing the first few diapers don't stay sealed.  I put the first diaper in and twist the DG probably 3-4 times and every time the first 2-4 diapers come unraveled until they sit deep enough to touch the bottom.  The instructions say to twist extra for the first few but they always come unravelled no matter how many times I try to seal the diaper.  It drives me crazy.  If I could get that part fixed, the Diaper Geenie would be a dream come true.",3
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I will buy a diaper genie for every baby shower I ever go to again!  This is one of the best things that I was given.  I have a highly sensitive sniffer and I do not like bad smells.  My daughter is six months old and I have yet to smell an odor in her room.  The genie is easy to use if you follow the directions and the refills are not that expensive because they do last for several weeks.  Don't go for the cheaper model, it stinks!",5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I registered for the diaper Genie when my daughter was born.  I did not know of any other product out there. It is now been 6 mos and I am ready for a new product!!  The diaper Genie is very stinky esp when the baby starts solids. You can never get rid of the odor. The darn thing broke the first time we tried to use it!!  It has these clamps that hold the diaper in place so one can twist it. Well now I've got 2 missing (I think they fell out when it was being emptied). Needless to say mine doesn't make a poopie sausage anymore. Also, it really doesn't hold as many as I thought it would. I definately think there are better products out there.",2
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I do not know how we would be able to live without our Diaper Genie! We live in a townhouse, so there is not much room. Whenever we have had anyone over, they all have the same question: why can't we smell diapers? The answer-the Diaper Genie! Some people I have noticed have complained about it being ""complicated"", but if you READ the directions, it is quite simple. I would highly recommend this to anyone having a baby-and if you are having multiples, get multiple Genie's. It is probably one of the most practical things we got for our daughter.",5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"Anyone who says that this is too difficult to use is either too lazy to read the instructions or not too bright. This thing is awesome. We have used it for over 2 years and it has worked perfectly. You never smell anything, and the refills last a long time. I highly recommend this item. The diapers come out in a hot dog-type fashion, so they all stay together when you emptying it.",5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"As a 1st time Mom, I registered for a diaper genie because I thought it sounded wonderful. Well, it's not. Now that my son is 6 months old, it stinks. I have spent a fortune on refill bags. No more, I bought a Diaper Champ this past weekend. It is so much easier to use. You just flip the handle and the diaper drops into a regular trash bag. I do not have to bend over and twist anything. When the bag is full, you just take it out. No more cutting, pulling, twisting, or knotting bags. I have decided to trash my Diaper Genie. At least this way, I am only using a trash bag instead of a refill and a trash bag. My suggestion-Don't waste your money on a Diaper Genie.",1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I was a loyal Diaper Genie user for the first couple of months after my daughter (now 18 months old) was born.  With my first daughter (now 5) I used the trash can method, and never had any problems with it, but I wanted to go high-tech with the newest bunchkin.  In the beginning, after acquainting myself with the method of operation, which was admittedly not the most intuitive of methods, it was a pretty nifty gadget.  No smell, easy to use, didn't have to empty it daily.  The first snag I ran into had to do with the refill.  The bag had bunched up and was stuck in the case, and it was so tight that I couldn't twist the ring to seal in the diapers.  I wasted alot of that refill trying to unstick the bag.  I got it working again, with no problems.  However, when I slipped in my next refill, I had one heckuva time trying to get the lid back down (not the one you slip the diaper through, but the one you slip the refill into).  After many many unsuccessful tries, it finally popped right in without explanation.  Weird.  But after a couple of months, it stunk something awful everytime I lifted the lid to stick another diaper in.  And we change it pretty often along with regular spritzing with Lysol.  Finally, the twist ring has become so chewed up that it's now almost impossible to close when we insert a new refill.  I'm beginning to think that I had less stress and more money (refills are about $5 each and we go through at least a couple a month) when I used the low-tech and less lazy empty-the-trash-can-daily method.  My diaper genie is about to be fired.",2
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,I would recommend everyone with a baby to buy this diaper genie. I bought two. It really keeps the smell locked up. It is easy to use and easy to install a new refill. I keep mine next to my bed and believe me my head lies near it and I smell nothing. Our bedroom is as clean and odor free as can be. It is worth every penny and it is affordable.,5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"Oh how quickly those cute little baby poopies will take on an unearthly smell that will curl your eyebrows.  This is a great invention.  Locks in the diaper, but more importantly - locks in the odors. I can't imagine not having one.",5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I didn't use mine for the first two weeks of my daughter's life because it was waaaaaaaaaaaaay too complicated! I figured it out, sort of, but to this day when I push the diaper in the film rips. Then when it comes time to change the film, the top doesn't cut the film so I have to use scissors. My sister-in-law told me to register for it. Why did I listen to her!Don't buy it! Dont register for it! It's not worth it! I want a refund!",1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"The Diaper Genie is definitely a worthwhile investment.  It's quick and easy to use, and definitely cuts down on dirty diaper smell big time.  Yes, when it gets full, there is an odor when you open it to empty it, but after all it IS a diaper pail and I guarantee you that if you kept the same amount of diapers in a regular garbage can, the smell would be unbearable.  I was a bit skeptical getting it after reading a few of these reviews, but I've been using it for 3 1/2 months with my 4 month old daughter and I don't know why anyone would use a regular wastebasket when you can use this disposal system.  As far as the liners are concerned...they're not expensive, last a decent amount of time and are nicely scented.  I will definitely continue to use this with my daughter and all future children.",4
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I bought this because I was told how wonderful it was, but when I started looking at costs of refills etc... I returned it.  I am breastfeeding and BF soiled diapers don't really smell very strong so I saw no added value in this gadget.  PLus we use both cloth and disposables and this just simply wouldn't work for us.",1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I'm reading all the negative reviews and giggling as I do it!!  This is probably the easiest product I've ever used and I'm shocked at the amount of people who cannot figure it out. (O.k. I guess I'm really not too shocked.) Anyway, to make the directions quick and easy: DON'T TWIST THE VERY TOP OF THE DIAPER GENIE UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO CHANGE IT!!  THIS CAUSES IT TO CUT THE BAGS INSIDE AND IF YOU'RE NOT READY FOR THAT IT DOES BECOME A MESS.  Geez people, read the directions before jumping into something.This product is great and has kept away the odor in my daughter's room.",5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"This product may seem a little difficult at first, getting the hang of the re-fills n' all, but the instructions are pretty specific and once you have it down, this is a MUST HAVE for any parent!  I bought 2 of them, one for upstairs and one for downstairs, and we have 2 babies, and it made life so much easier.  The first one was a slightly older model with a separate razor thingy to cut the bag to empty it out.  The newer one (shown above) has it attached to the top and you just twist the top to cut the bag and that is very nice, though both ways were pretty easy for us.  I think it's definitely worth getting, the re-fills last a very long time, and so aren't so bad for the price you pay.  It saves a lot of time and worry about how to despose of those stinky diapers.  I don't know about anyone else, but if we were ever at Grandma's house who didn't havea diaper genie, I would put the dirty diaper in a small grocery bag and put it outside until they took their trash out, those things can really stink up  your home if they aren't outside or sealed in the diaper genie.  I think they're amazing that way and much more effective than sealing them in a garbage bag.HOpe this Helps!!MOmmie of 2 and one on the way!!",5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"We tried the genie for a week and were dissapointed in the small number of diapers you could put in before you had to change the bag (which are specially made for the Genie.)  If you are looking for a unit that uses standard kitchen trash bags, go with the Diaper Champ. It does not smell and it easily holds more than one days worth of diapers.",1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I don't know what I would do without the Diaper Genie.  I have twins, and I change about 15 diapers a day, with more than one *smelly* diaper a day!  No odor escapes this pail, and, contrary to other reviews I've read, the inside of my pail does not stink, but I remove the chain of diapers every couple of days.  The purpose of this pail is not to avoid having to take out a bag of dirty diapers, but to avoid the smell.  I have to agree that there is a problem with that first diaper to go in - but what I do is push the first diaper all the way down to the bottom of the pail, and then open up the bottom and tape it down with some masking tape to hold it in place so I can twist the wrapping.  You only have to do it for the first diaper to go in, and it works.  The plastic has a wonderful scent, and it's a piece of cake to empty and refill, IF you read the directions.  I would buy this again, and I even recommended it to my best friend when she became pregnant with her first child.  It may have a flaw, but it's still the best diaper pail available, and you will never smell a dirty diaper!",5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I registered for and received two Diaper Genies when my son was born 8 months ago. Both are now stored in my basement, awaiting my next garage sale. Emptying this thing takes some getting used to, and the diapers can not be left in the Genie for more than a day or two because it stinks too much. The Diaper Champ is much neater and easier to use. Spend your money on the Champ instead.",1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"My husband begged me to get this! I said 'no way'. I had heard horror stories about how difficult it is to use, and that it doesn't really work. I also thought it was pretty gross to leave dirty, soiled diapers sitting in a room, even if the smell is masked. But he got it anyway. He ran out and got one when the baby was one week old.Now I am glad we have it. It really does work. It is a little tricky to figure out (I kept twisting the wrong part and cutting off each bag), but it is worth it. You can empty it as often as you wish, and you don't have to use it for the really nasty diapers. You can always run those out to the trash outside. It is pretty inexpensive for what it does!",5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I recently bought my first diaper genie. I was a little reluctant to buy it due to the fact that my kids are 5,4 and 2. The youngest is still in diapers and the other 2 wear pull ups at night. We usually just throw the pull-ups and diapers in the trash in the bathroom. Well the stench was really bad, even though I would throw out the trash very often. My sister just had a baby and received the diaper genie at her baby shower. She loves hers and told me to get one. I read the reviews online and was reluctant like I said. I went to the store and looked at in person, compared it to other pails, ect... I decided to go ahead and buy it and bought the stage 2(toddler) refills to use with it since I would be putting pull-ups and size 6 diapers in it. I love the diaper genie! I wish I had bought it a lot sooner. I have not had any of the problems other people have written in their reviews and neither has my sister(who's baby is a month old). I know I will be using this genie until we are a diaper/pull-up free household.",5

Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"Gods gift to parents! I have 2, one for upstairs one for down. I take care of 1 kid and have 1, so the diapers pile up quick. Most people never know I keep the dirty diapers in the kitchen! You can't smell them!!! I LOVE THE GENIE!!!",5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"ALL Diaper contraptions smell.  Don't buy into the hype that this one prevents the diapers from smelling less.  When I empty the thing - most of the wrapped packages come undone, which can be irritating.  It took me a month to figure out how to change the darn bag also.  After 5 months I am still not doing it right each time.  (And I do computer coding...How is it this diaper pail has me searching for the badly written directions all the time?!)  My son's messy diapers are VERY messy and since you have to push the diaper or wipes WAY down in there - I'm usually getting muck on my hand.  I can see why some like this Genie and others don't but I'm headed back to the store.  ONE PLUS:  you can find the replacement bags all over the place because it's so popular.",3
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"Have you ever noticed that all first time parents have this, but seldom do you see it used with the second or third child?  It is for a good reason, it is a pain!  I found it very cumbersome to get the diaper in the container and make sure it was closed back up, while I had a crying, squirming baby in my arms.  The the worst part is when you have to open up the bottom, and take out the sausage like package of petrified diapers.  They still end up stinking up the baby's room!  I have found it is much cheaper, and more sanitary to simply put a diaper pail (or wastebasket with lid) right outside of my sliding glass door.  That way I can throw the diapers out, with no nasty smell in the house.  And then just take that bag out to the trash along with my kitchen trash.  No more carrying poopy diaper links out to the garbage.",1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"very welcome item in our baby nursery.i have seen different versions of this product but just a note of caution. the hard plastic lid on ours had some very sharp edges such that i cut my finger reaching into the &quot;finger hole&quot; to open the lid. happened twice, nasty bloody cuts. we finally ended up sanding down the edge. besides that, it is easy to learn how to change the refills.",4
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,We got this as a shower gift... we did register for it because we heard good things about it. But i have to say to operate it is a pain in the neck. You have buy special liners for it and then when it's full take out the sausage linked diapers and put it in ANOTHER garbage bag - so your double bagging. The manual wheel you had to turn to seal each bag didnt work properly half the time and wouldn't seal the diaper correctly. Eventually it got to be too much of a hassle to use so we have stopped using it and are going to to get a Diaper champ instead. It may not seal each diaper but at least we won't have to buy special liners for it and can use a regular garbage bag.,2
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"So far, the Diaper Genie is working like a dream for me. I have a &quot;hand-me-down&quot; with the original narrower opening. My baby is 5 weeks old, and the partly-used film that it came with is still going strong. There's probably not any smell because she's a newborn and strictly breastfed.  I can detect no odor whatsoever, even when I open it to remove the full sausage link.I recommend this method for saving the film:  Sealing each diaper in its own link is wasteful -- at the end of it all, the links unravel into a long sausage, so why not do this...I seal each one with a twist after i first shove it down past the tabs (you can feel them if you push deep enough.  On the NEXT diaper, I UNTWIST to expose the previous diapers and shove the diaper right in there, and then retwist.  It holds the odors in just fine and saves YARDS of that film. And you can get more diapers into the barrel of the genie. Marvelous results.I AM disappointed in the cutting mechanism, but find it works best if you twist the thing quite tight, and retwist as needed until the film is cut. Anyone have any tips on making that part work better?",4
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,We love the diaper genie.  Contains the odor well and is easy to use.,5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,We got a different diaper pail when my daughter was born and it broke and smelled within weeks. We then went out and bought the diaper genie and fell in love. No more poopie smell and it was so easy to empty and refill. I would recommend this to anyone.,4
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I have two major complaints about the Diaper Genie. First, it does not keep the stink out. Actually, that's not true. It does keep the stink out as long as you don't open the lid to put a diaper in, but once you open the lid you need to run out of the room. And what good is a diaper pail if you can't stand to open it to put diapers in? (Of course, you get a double-dose of the smell when you open the bottom to empty it!) The other complaint is the special liners. I knew when I got it that it needed the separate liners, but I had no idea how quickly they would need to be refilled. I am looking for a new diaper pail now and will certainly get one that uses normal trash bags.",2
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"we thoght this was great by the time our son was 4 months old we stopped using it.  Yes, there will always be a stink with all pails.. but this one seems to come more from the BAG refills then from the poop.  We stopped using it, not only because of the smell but it's not convient to bend so far down and &quot;PLAY&quot; around with making sure it is placed correctly and turned.. it's easier to use a plastic bag in a garbage can and remove it each night.",3
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"The Diaper Genie has gotten some bad reviews,but if you compare it to all the other Diaper Pails out there,it beats them all by far. If you take the extra minute to read the instructions(and never let Mr. Dad lay a finger on it)then you never have a problem with it. The only problem i had was the diapers didn't always twist right, so they were all wrapped together but it still wrapped them up and kept the smell out, and i kind of liked it b/c the refill lasted longer w/ less bag being used and the bag wasn't so long when i went to empty it.",5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I fell for all the hype too. Thought it would be a great idea. My husband and I sat down and messed with this thing over and over trying to get the twisting mechanism to work without squishing a diaper in our hand. Nasty. Not sure about the smell thing, we just tried it with plain diapers first to see if it worked ok. I returned it 2 days after I bought it. We went back to the store and bought a covered garbage can and keep it in the bathroom. Between the mechanism not twisting properly and the bags never sealing or cutting it was more time consuming than helpful.",1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"The diaper genie seems to be more work than it is worth.  It fills up so fast and sometimes the liners rip causing problems. I am sure a more ordinary diaper waste container would be easier.  It does keep out odor, which is good.",3
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I think the Diaper Genie works very well. I have no complaints. It is extremely easy to operate and change the bags. In my opinion, it is the best looking diaper pail and it contains the odor beautifullly. I highly recommend this product.",5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"Do not buy this piece of junk. You need a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering to use it.  And even if you can figure it out, it doesn't work all that well.Instead, buy a trash can with a lid.  Trust me, you'll be happy you did.",1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"LISTEN up new parents!  This one isn't worth the money.  It is smelly and difficult to change.  The refills are expensive.  I will soon be buying my third diaper pail and my daughter is 15 months old.  Hopefully, the next one, Diaper Champ, will be better!",1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"Prior to parenthood, I had heard several parents rave about this product, but even my tempered expectations were not prepared for the disappointments with this product. After using a Diaper Genie for a year I am shocked by the popularity of this product. Everything about it, including the design, the manufacturing, and the accessories, are a big disappointment. Furthermore, the product is clearly designed to ""give away the razor to sell you the razor blades."" The initial product seems moderately priced, but their profit really comes from the high-priced refills, which are little more than thin plastic bags which sell for [$$$] or more.DesignThe lid is not child-proof as advertised. My toddler has been able to flip it open since he was old enough to stand up (age 1). There is nothing even remotely child-proof about the lid. The top of the Genie is an over-complicated, somewhat fragile lid-within-a-lid, which my wife and all of our babysitters find confusing to use when replacing refills. It took me 15-20 minutes the first time I did it (I'm an engineer), so since I now have the expertise, the Genie goes unused until I can refill it.  From an engineering standpoint, the Genie appears designed to dispense the maximum amount of plastic wrap possible while allowing as much odor to escape the unit as possible, thereby encouraging you to refill the unit frequently.ManufacturingAs other users have reported, the plastic of which the Genie is made of ABSORBS odors, causing the unit to PERMANENTLY stink after about 6 months. I have washed it with everything I could think of, including bleach, to no avail. The thin plastic tab holding the bottom door tight broke off in the first few weeks, so I jury-rigged it.  The plastic lid does not even attempt to be air-tight, allowing odors to escape easily from inside the unit.AccessoriesThe fundamental purpose of the Genie is to seal dirty diapers in a plastic wrap, with twists in between each diaper. First, the Genie only holds 12-15 dirty diapers from a 1 yr old, not the ""up to 25"" advertised. Second, the plastic is so thin that ALL odors pass through it. While the plastic does seal the diapers from leaking, the odors pass right through. The plastic is of incredibly cheap quality and thickness, nowhere close to the quality of good outdoor plastic garbage bags. The plastic has been scented with a scent I find repulsive. The refills, which are only available from Playtex, are sold at a huge markup from their actual cost, and only 5 refills cost more than the entire unit itself.ConclusionIf I believed in conspiracy theories, I might think the Diaper Genie was a cynical attempt by Playtex to get parents to consume expensive refills as fast as possible.  At the very least, it is a horrible product which is a complete waste of money. You will be wise to save your money, just buy some thick outdoor garbage bags and an inexpensive metal garbage can with a lid, and you'll have a much more effective, inexpensive Diaper Genie of your own.",1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I love the Diaper Genie!  I received this as a shower gift nine years ago with my first child when it was a relatively new product.  I loved it so much that I have saved it all these years in hopes that one day we would have another baby.  Well, with baby number two due April 28 I am very glad I saved it.  If I had not I would certainly be buying another one.  The system is easy to use and odor free!  I would take it out to the big trash can to empty it cut the bag with the cutter and pop the bottom open over the trash can.  It couldn't be cleaner or easier.  I would recommend this product highly to any parents.",5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,For ME the diaper geine is great...is not smelly at all. Now if you leave it with dirty diapers for weeks of course is going to smell...is easy to take the diapers out and you just drop the refill every now and then. The refills are not expensive and if you think they are just use your normal waste basket and have a smelly house. I never had any problems with it.,5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"It stinks!!!  It definatly keeps the smell in, but then where does the smell go?  No where, it just sits there and gets worse and worse.  I've tried cleaning it, spraying disinfectant in it, anything, but it still stinks.  I love the concept but they need to work on it a little more.",3
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,I got this as a baby shower gift from a friend and we used it for a couple weeks.then I went to buy refills for it and they were expensive I would much rather do the sented bags you can get 100 of them at any dollar store.,2
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"The Diaper Genie is another one of those things that you feel you can live without until you have one.  I have read the instructions, set the thing up and used it three times and then it just bound up on me.  I thought I was doing something wrong, but the diapers that were in the bottom were sitting as directed.  I will admit that it took some time as Playtex does skimp on directions.  It is not worth the money!!!",1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"As the other reviews state, this product is a waste of time and money.  I used to babysit a little girl a number of years ago who's parents used one of these.  When I first started babysitting her, the mom told me not to bother with the Diaper Genie.  It wasn't until I had my own daughter (now 6 months old) that I found out WHY it was such a bother!  First, the pail does not hold many diapers, especially as the baby grows and gets bigger, so you're having to change it out all the time.  Second, refilling the contraption is just way too complicated (as well as refills can get expensive) is just a pain!  You have to cut the bag with the cutter attached in the lid, tie off the bag, pull up enough plastic to make a NEW bag (hoping and praying that there is enough), and then deal with the smell after you open the thing up.  Plus, I don't know how many other people have this problem, but I have a hard time getting the first few diapers to make ""capsels"", so there are usually 5-8 diapers at the bottom collecting the stinch!  Mine is still sitting in the corner of my daughter's room, now going unused, while I use a regular trash can.  My suggestion: DON'T BUY A DIAPER GENIE!  I, too, don't understand why these are still so popular when they are such a hassle instead.",1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"This is one of the worst things that I have ever bought. This diaper pail holds VERY few diapers. I find that I have to empty it out every two days. This is VERY ANNOYING as it is a bit of an ordeal to change the bag. Enough so that I end up just throwing the diapers in the normal trash becuase I am so sick of changing the diaper genie that is always full.As far as problems operating it, if you read the instructions, then it is not hard to figure out, but the bottom line is that this thing is more trouble than it is worth. If they made one 4 times the size, then maybe I would be interested.",1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I would not recommend this diaper pail.  The plastic latches on the top cover broke off after 2 months' use and we had problems fitting the refills into the container correctly.  Our Diaper Genie smelled and did not correctly twist or knot the dirty diapers like described.  I tossed it and used a regular trash can with a lid.  If emptied frequently, it's better than this product because there's no hassle.",1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"It was great in the beginning but after awhile i realized how much of a pain it was. First of all no one but you knows how to use it, when you change the bags and start new, the first few all fall in together. its hard to separate the diapers, when you twist the top it never seals until the 3rd or 4th diaper.  Plus ive yet to see it hold odor.  Its really more trouble than its worth.",2
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I got this as a gift and loved it for the first six months.  Then I discovered what a waste of money it was.  Once solid foods were introduced into my son's diet, this didn't even come close to holding in the stench.  I even used the different types of refills that were made for it...ie. infant, original and toddler.  Still didn't do the trick.  I even put air fresheners in and near it....  Eventually I gave up and took dirty diapers straight out to the garage and only used it for pee diapers.  Still a hassle to remove the ""diaper weenie"" so now I just use a normal trash can.  Much less hassle and same results.",1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"We are currently using the Diaper Genie for our 7 week old baby, and it is excellent so far.  If you follow the instructions that come with the package, you should not have any problems.  We haven't had any problems operating the product, with odor, or changing the refills.  Another thing, the refills last longer than I expected.  I am still using the refill that came with the Genie and I have been changing diapers constantly since my baby was born.  I definitely recommend it.",5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I have 2 Diaper Genies- and I am quite satisfied with them. (upstairs and downstairs units)1. Smells are contained- except when changing out the refill bag.  Then look out.  Pewww!  But, doesn't all trash stink when changing the bag? And like most trash cans- it will need washing or deodorizing at some point.2. Holds 3-5 days worth of my toddler diapers. (more if I ball up the diapers into smaller packages.) I remove the bag every week before trash day.3. Propriatary refill bags are a drag.  I hate to spend the money on them. I have tried using a regular plastic trash bag in the Genie- BIG MISTAKE. It smelled like I was using a open trash can.  I look forward to some company making a &quot;knock off&quot; refill that can save money someday. These refills do last a good while though- 1-2 months on my unit that gets the most use,even longer on the other unit.4. My daughter can't get into the unit- to play in the trash.5. Easy for me to refill- impossible for my husband.  Go figure. He is probably playing dumb to get out of a stinky job.There are so few options out there for diaper disposal- so, go for it.  Try the Diaper Genie-it is certainly better than going to the garage after each diaper change to dispose.  Good luck!",5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"We have a 6lb chihuahua that we love, but she uses puppy pads in a box and refuses to go out side.  Very easy for us but the smell was getting to me.  This Diaper Genie has seriously eliminated all of that horrible urine smell from my basement.  I threw out the old garbage can and this is all we use now.  This diaper genie is the best.",5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"Nothing personal against this particular diaper genie - it's the whole concept that's a waste of time.  My husband told me when I was shopping to just buy a metal tin can and put plastic bags in it but I wouldn't listen!  I had to have the DIAPER GENIE,so I rcv'd it as a baby shower gift.  Not even one month into using it, it broke.  It was stinky and complicated to place the trash bags in and out of.  Trust me, throw the diapers away in a trash can.  Or place the diaper immendiately in a small baggie and then throw AWAY in the trash can.  Don't waste your money or a registry item on this.",1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"My wife and I are considering getting a *second* diaper genie for downstairs, given how well this works for us!I have a lingering suspicion that many of the negative reviewers below aren't using the Diaper Genie properly.  Not that it's difficult to use: just put the diaper in the top until it reaches the clips about 5 inches down, and spin the opening a good 5-6 rotations.  You're sealed up and ready to go.While the cost of refills is up to you to judge, I should say that they're easy to get either here at Amazon or at warehouse shops and grocery stores.  Convenient!This thing has helped us after some *major* blowouts, and I'm impressed with just how many diapers it can hold.",5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,Stinky - The baby's room always smelled of dirty diapers. Expensive - Constantly replacing the bag cartridge. Too complicated - Changing the cartridge can only be done by someone who has read the instructions first.  Too small - Holds 25 diapers...HA! I have absolutely nothing good to say about this product. Don't waste your money.,1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I love the Diaper Genie and won't use anything else and I have used others. With my first baby I used the trash can and talk about smelling up the whole house. Unless you take the trash out right after a poppy diaper your house will stink!!!! Then I bought a no name diaper pail pretty much it was a trash can with a lid same problem it smelled. I am amazed at how Well the diaper genie holds back the smells.As for the complaints people listed all you need to do is READ the direction!!! My husband can empty and load new genies bags in minutes. He says it's as easy as changing a bag in a garbage can, if you just follow the direction. And for the complaints that as the baby gets older it doesn't hold the smell back anymore. The problem there is they probably never clean it!!!! Anytime you put smelly diapers in something after months of use it's going to soak up the smells and start to stink. So once a month when the genie is empty spray some Clorox or pine sole in and wipe and keep it fresh smelling as you would any trash can. Since the genie bags keep the pail Very clean, I can see why some would go years and never giving it a good wipe down, but to keep smells from building up spray something in it once and awhile. I will definitely use the genie again with our 3rd baby!!!!!!",5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,I wish I would have read some reviews before registering for the Diaper Genie.It fills up too quickly.  Dumping the diapers is a pain.  The refills are expensive.  It does not contain odors very well.  I'm thinking about using a garbage can with a lid instead of the Diaper Genie.,1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I have used this product quite a bit.  It IS cumbersome and it IS expensive...  This is an innescessary, wasteful product.",1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,I received this as a shower gift and was disappointed because I had heard bad things about it.  To my surprise I have not had any problems with it whatsoever.  Just follow the instructions that come with it and you should be fine.  It has kept our nursery odor free.  Great Product.,5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"We did alot of research on diaper pails before our first child was born. We knew a few couples with the Diaper Genie, and one couple with the Diaper Champ. The couple with the Diaper Champ has a baby that is 3 months older than our child. This couple liked their Champ just fine, saying they noticed no odors. We also read tons of reviews, mainly here on Amazon, of both products. And from the reviews, it seemed there were many happy customers of both products. So we decided, if they were about equal, we would go with the more convenient and cheaper solution, the Champ.Well, we were pretty happy for about 4 to 6 months. We very much liked that we could use our regular trash bags. And changing the Champ's bag is very easy. But after our child was well into eating solids, at about 7 months, the smell became unbearable. It really is true that babies' poops really start to stink much, much worse when they eat lots of solids. So we went out and bought a Diaper Genie.  We have been using the Genie now for 2 months and very happy with the Genie. The Genie has 2 big advantages over the Champ, in regards to smell control. 1) Each diaper is contained in its own litte pouch via the Genie's twisting mechanism. 2) The filler bags progress in thickness, so as your child gets older, and her poops get smellier, you can get thicker, better bags.After using the Genie for about 2 months now, we are very pleased. The Champ is essentially a simple waste pail with a fancy hood. The hood and ordinary trash bags don't do much for odor prevention. The drawbacks to the Genie though, are that you must buy their fillers, and the bag changing mechanism is much more complicated than the Champ's. We thought these were worth dealing with to prevent the odors.",5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I have been using the Diaper Genie from day one and it is an awesome product. I wish I had thought of it! My only complaint is that the first few diapers don't tend to stay separated, I have gotten it to work a few times but it's tricky. As long as there isn't a poopy in the first 3-5 you put in, odor isn't a problem. If I have a poopy after I've just changed it I just take it straight out to the dumpster. No problem! It also is easy to carry for travel when you go on vacation.",4
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,But my husband wanted it on the registry.  And we both love it.  It is very convenient.  Contains smells unlike a regular garbage could.,5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I am pretty happy with my daiper genie.  I haven't tried other diaper pails for comparison, but this one does the trick, and helps control odor.  Its roomy enough that I only need to empty it every two or three days with size 3 diapers.  To help with odor control I spray with lysol each time I empty it.  It is easy to change the refills, but there is one ring inside that is difficult to fit in place when changing the refill.",4
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"This was the greatest thing when I brought my son home from the hospital! No smell. It took us a while to figure out how to use it. I even loved the smell of the refills.Then my son started on solids. He is now 11 months old and the diaper genie hasn't been used in a month. I can't stand to even open the lid to put a diaper in it, much less empty it. A couple of months ago, I put a Wizard Stick up in the top and two in the bottom to help the horrible smell. This did the trick for a week! After buying 10 refills, now I have to spend that much more on the stick-ups? No way!We started using a trash can with the scented liner and it smells better than the diaper genie, and we have just finished a week of the stomach flu. (But this method doesn't work for the dog owner or the curious crawler!)Large capacity-NOT! I never did get more than 20 diapers in mine except for the newborn size. The snake would get balled up if you ""twisted"" the bag more than three times, which like someone else said uses the refills up to fast.We followed the directions and used it correctly. IT DID LIVE UPto it's claims. I was extremely satisfied with it until a couple of months ago-that is why I gave it 3 stars!1. This product is difficult to use until you get used to it. (My left handed mother kept turning it the other way from us!)2. Refills can get pricey (You can buy two CHAMPS in what you will spend on a year of refills!)3. Once the diapers get really stinky, so does the GENIE!Knowing what I know now, I would not recommend this to anyone who wants to use it past the 6 month point. Save your money and just use a trash can or check out the reviews on the competition!",3
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,Don't waste your money on a Diaper Genie. I had great expectations. I guess I should have had no expectations because we use it no more. It got stinky. And it's just a hassle to use. It's a lot easier to throw the dirty diaper in a plastic grocery bag and toss it in the garbage.,1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I received a diaper genie as a gift and it sounded great but we ended up not really needing it.  We used all the time at first, then only for ""stinkys"" then quit using it altogether.  For us it was just as easy to toss the diapers in the main house trash.  We live in the boonies and have to take our garbage to the dump so house trash goes to the barn pretty much daily.  Once your baby is mobile, you're probably not going to keep it in their room, my guys figured out how to knock it over and open it, not only gross but dangerous since there are some sharp cutting edges any averagely resourceful kid can get at.  The other thing to consider, if you are even remotely environmentally concious, this thing is an environmental nightmare, not only are you encasing the dirty diapers in extra plastic, you then need another bag for the diaper ""sausage"".  Essentially the diapers get wrapped in extra plastic twice.",3
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I thought this would be a great thing to have but after my baby started eating solids the stink escapes. I switched to toddler liners but that did not help much either. Not many diapers fit in the pail. You can never get just one diaper in the first section. No matter how many times you turn it the hanging diaper twists into the new diaper. The only thing I can say good about it, is that it is better than a plain trash can.",2
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I have used the Original Diaper Genie with all three of my children.  I thought it was a neat little invention when I first got it as a baby shower gift.  I would have to say that I haven't had a problem with odors while the system is completely closed (bags fully twisted, top on, and not too full).  However, keep a can of air freshener and/or Lysol spray nearby when you empty [it], or you are in for a real ""treat""!  In fact, I would strongly recommend taking it straight to the garbage can outside and emptying it there, right over top of it.  The canister itself holds in the odor, but the bags DO NOT.  So when you unload that thing, you might want to do it in a place where there is plenty of ventilation!  The cutter hasn't been that bad for me.  Granted, you have to make a few passes with it, but I have found that if I twist the bag a little while I twist the cutter, it does a lot better (the key is TENSION).  All in all, I have not been ""dissatisfied"" with the Diaper Genie.  It has made it through three children, and I can honestly say that my baby's room smells clean and fresh 90% of the time, which is what matters most to me.",3
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I registered for the Diaper Genie because I heard great things and also looked at the reviews.  It started to work fine for about a week or so.  When I tried to put the diaper in the Genie it was very tight and when I tried to turn the top it would be hard.  Everything would go good until, I was probably at the 10th or so diaper, then it just wouldn't work right after that.  On several occasions my husband would say he fixed it, but the same problem would happen again.  Now maybe we just had it all wrong, but I really don't think so.  I don't recommend the Diaper Genie.  It is now sitting in my son's room in the corner with no use out of it.",2
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"Everyone I know who is a new parent has one of these things.  They also have given up on it after a while.  I don't know anyone that actually bought it for themselves... it's always a registry gift, or a hand-me-down.  It's a nice concept, but it doesn't use regular bags, and you have to shove your hand along with the poopy diaper into it.  That alone was enough for me to switch to the Champ!",1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"This thing is a waste of money. It fills up too fast and the refills are expensive. I recommend the Diaper Champ. You don't have to use any special bags, just regular trash bags, and it holds a lot more diapers. Stay away from the Diaper Genie. It sounds neat but it's not. It's annoying.",1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"Refills are expensive, and the average newborn goes through more than one a month. My son was going through a refill every 9 days for the first 2 months.  Now, he's 4 months old, and he's going through a refill every 3 weeks.  Now that he's on solid food and his diapers are more stinky, it is NOT completely odor free like the box claims to be. I can definately smell baby powder scent over poop if I am near the genie. If I had to buy it over again, I would purchase the Diaper Champ.",2
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,It is a BIG WASTE OF MONEY. The Diaper genie is good for when your baby is an newborn (1-3 months) After they are 4 months there doo doo really stinks and the smell does come out a little bit even if you change it every other day. The inside gets  horrible smell like something died in it. It is very hard to replace the refill. Even though they discontinued selling the original they still sell the refills for the original right next to the the wide refills. So for my baby shower I recieved the original re-fill for my wide genie. And I did not notice it untill I tried to replace it so I already opened the origianl refill and some how broke the darn thing. So right now it is in the garbage. Money down the drain.,1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"This product has done well for me. I have a two-month-old daughter. The refills are expensive but they last a long time. I empty this two or three times a week. Sometimes I notice an odor. That's because my husband won't use it properly. If you use this, you have to do a few things to prevent odor:- Always twist after you put a diaper in, don't leave it sitting in top- Empty it promptly as soon as you have to push to get a diaper in- For the first few diapers, position them carefully and give them some extra twists- Always give enough twists, one little turn won't be enough- Keep the lid closedIf you (or your spouse) can't use the thing properly all the time you may want to consider something a little more forgiving.",4
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I received this as a shower gift but when the time came to use it, it didn't work like they say is does. It doesn't start to twist the diapers until there is enough diapers in it to reach the bottom. Everytime you put another diaper in, the one before it untwists and they fall together. So your &quot;sausage&quot; has one huge link and several small links. I went to another type of diaper pail and gave mine to someone else.",1
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,I had no trouble using this product.  The directions are very clear and include pictures.  Our baby is one week old and going through diapers like mad.  This works great and there is no smell.  I bought this on recommendation from my brother who bought it 5 years ago for his eldest son.  They are now using the same one for their 3 1/2 month old.  Overall a great product.,5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I love this product.  Once I figured out how to use it, I became extremely satisfied.  The main problem is that if someone else changes the baby, they usually turn the wrong section, which cuts the plastic rather than sealing the diaper.  It is not to difficult to fix after that though.",4
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I really like the Diaper Genie...  I can finally walk into my nursery and not tear up from the smell of dirty/stinky diapers!  Although I have found the smell-free zone appealing, there are a few drawbacks to the device.  It is a bit complicated to figure out... make sure you save the instructions, you will need to review them from time to time.  It does fill up fast, but I would be changing a regular diaper pail just as frequently.  The refill bags last for a reasonable amount of time (about three weeks), but you do have to buy Playtex's brand of refills and not some of the cheaper generic brands.  (Be careful too that you get the correct refill bags, since there is a wide mouth unit and a smaller older version.... I can thank my husband for finding out about that one!)  All in all, I have found that the benefits far outweigh the pains in using this device.  If I had to do it over again, I would opt for the unit just so that I can enjoy time in my nursery with my baby without having to feel like I am trapped in a porto-potty!",4
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I love my diaper genie and there is no diaper odor, as long as you make sure the dirty diaper is completely twisted in its own little &quot;pocket&quot;. It fills up fast and you can run out of the plastic bag without warning. Also once you start a new &quot;train&quot; of dirty diapers, it's difficult to get the first one started through correctly. Overall, I love it and am glad I own one.",4
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,The Diaper Genie is sooo easy to use and they always have coupons on refills.  I love it.. Even my husband can use it lolol... u just pop a diaper in til u feel the grabber thingys and then close it and twist the lid and it locks in the diaper... I can keep it next to the changing table and know my son can't get into it and won't smell his nasty poopies..,4
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,We received the Diaper Genie as a shower gift and were not impressed.  The smell was aweful and we had to fight with it to get the ring to turn.  After a week of frustration I went out and bought a Diaper Dekor Plus.  I'll admit that the smell isn't pleasant when you change the bag but it is a lot easier than the Diaper Genie.  Another nice feature of the Dekor is you can keep one hand on the baby and use your foot to open the container to dispose of the diaper unlike the Genie. Spend a little more and make your life easier!,3
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"we've been using this for 15 months with no problems.  though the retainer clip that keeps the cutter in the lid did just break off.  i think what works best for us, and keeps the cost WAY down on refills is to only use the genie for the poopy diapers.  the rest we toss in a lidded medium kitchen trash can.  a month or so ago, i filled them both with bleach water for several hours--they were beginning to smell.  but i think that's not so bad for 14 months of continuous use!  meanwhile, i just spray the inside of both with lysol each time i empty them.  i also just read a tip somewhere that wiping them out with a disinfectant cloth also works.so far, i may have changed the refill only 5 times or so. not bad!  i'm glad i got this as a shower gift!",4
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Four Lock Assembly,"I love these locks, and the fact that when baby is asleep or out of the house, you can deactivate them with a quick flick of a little switch!! (obviously, you need to remember to reactivate them, or they are useless).I completely disagree with the &quot;impossible to install&quot; reviewer - they could not have been more self-explanatory!  (Send those that are hanging in your garage to us - we'll use them!)  We did need to use a drill, but they are far stronger than any others (especially the stick-on ones) that we tried.You do need to have a set spot that the &quot;key&quot; goes after each use, or you will be frustrated and out of luck if the key is misplaced.  All family members needing access to the locked cabinets must religiously return the key to its place - and the locks work like a charm!",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Four Lock Assembly,"These locks are the best solutions I've tried, for many applications, but compared to the others they are also VERY DIFFICULT TO INSTALL.  I am a carpenter but don't mean to say you can't install them with modest skills -- yet there are many opportunities to mess up by misaligning the pieces, tearing up the wood, stripping the screws, or drilling through the drawer/door front -- it is necessary to drill from the back to within ONE EIGHTH INCH of the front.  Sure you can do it, with care, but care takes time and we all have bad days.  I think they should give you a drill bit and stop, or at least sell one alongside the locks.They should insist that EVERYONE GET AT LEAST TWO KEYS because you *will* either lose one (perhaps to a curious toddler) or, my weakness, lock the key in the cabinet or drawer.  Next, the locks are not very adaptable to the many drawer and door configurations out there for lack of a surface to mount, clearance to moving parts, or tight quarters difficulty maneuvering the drill where it needs to be.  They also don't need to use these irritatingly small screws (#4's?).When these magnetic locks work right, they are a dream.  We have one on the hallway medicine cabinet that has been working flawlessly for seven years.  But being the best is not always enough, and it is on installation that these stumble.",3
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Four Lock Assembly,"Just like the others have all stated, prepare to study the instructions for a while before drilling.  I'm very handy with this sort of thing, but the totloc installation is not particularly intuitive.After the learning curve is found the rest is a cinch and worth it.  It's a great lock system and completely hidden from view.  The bypass switch is great for cooking as long as your child is not in the kitchen.  Just make sure that you flip the bypass back after you are finished.  -Forgetting to do that has always haunted me...",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Four Lock Assembly,"I have a wooden desk that seemed to be unchildproofable! I tried several different latch-style locks but nothing would fit because of the way the desk is built. I read some reviews on these Tot Loks and I have to admit I was afraid to buy them because everyone was saying that they are difficult to install.I bought some anyway. I found that they were EASIER to install than any two piece latch-style locks. With the latch-style, you have to do tedious measuring which I have zero patience with. Tot Loks come with little templates so, there is NO MEASURING involved!!My advice to anyone is to read the instructions over four or five times while sitting in front of your drawers or cabinets with all the pieces of the locks with you. After reading and looking for a while, I understood completely. I also suggest using some clear tape to tape down the template, especially on the side where you have to drill several holes. These take some time to install but, with a little patience, they are very simple and VERY effective! I'm glad I got them and I will be getting more!",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Four Lock Assembly,I FOUND THESE VERY HANDY WITH MY SON WHO HAS BROKE ALL BUT TWO OF THE OLD FASHIONED STLYE LOCKS. HE JUST YANKS THE DOOR OPEN AND BREAKS THE LATCH OFF. I FOUND THEM A LITTLE HARD TO INSTALL AT FIRST BUT ONCE I FIGURED IT OUT WITH THE TEMPLATE PROVIDED THEY ARE NOT REALLY THAT HARD. I PLAN ON GETTING MORE TO REPLACE THE BROKEN ONES NOW THAT I AM PREGNANT WITH MY THIRD CHILD. WE JUST PUT THE MAGNET ON THE TOP FRONT OF THE FRIDGE SO IT DOESN'T GET LOST AND NO LITTLE HANDS (EVEN IF HE CLIMBS ON A CHAIR) CAN REACH IT.,5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Four Lock Assembly,"I was also concerned about installation based on a few amazon.com reviews. However, like another person said, the first took a little longer, but I had all four installed in under a half hour. It was actually fun and rewarding! How often can you say that about putting something together/ installing something??My tip: drill right through the paper guide. It won't swirl around the paper unless you're using the larger 9/32"" bit, which you can drill last. That one definitely has to be drilled perfectly, but the smaller holes for screws can be less deep than the screw. The screw will easily make its own hole when you drill it in.",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Four Lock Assembly,"This set of locks installs easier than the old style, but they're bigger and don't have as powerful magnets.  Also, these don't come with a key, you have to buy it separately.",3
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Four Lock Assembly,"I have tried and have seen other people try other cabinet locks. The tot-lock was wonderful. Even when my son gets a hold of the key, he just can't figure out how it works.",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Four Lock Assembly,"We have several different type of locks we use to baby proof.  These magnetic locks are very good about protecting little fingers and really keeping the kids out.  However, we chose not to install them on all the cabinets because of the little magnetic opener.  Our preschooler thinks its fun to take off with it, and if we store it somewhere out of reach, it takes way too long to open the cabinet to just get out toothpaste or whatnot.  In the kitchen, you can store the opener high on the refrigerator, but again, you must retrieve it every time you want to open something.We use these locks on some of the high-risk, low-use cabinets we have.  These include cabinets that store chemicals or sharp items like knives.  Overall, a good product for the right place.",4
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Four Lock Assembly,"I have installed these at more than one house (complete cabinet sets).  It should be noted that I am highly qualified for the installation task so it was not problem.  Installation does involve drilling one 1/4"" hole part of the way through the cabinet and the you may also want to drill tiny pilot holes for the four mounting screws.  Door thickness is not generally a problem as they do have adapters for varying thicknesses.  My children are now grown and I no longer use them, but my review still stands.The locks are high quality, they cannot be opened without the key. They are strong, and do not allow anyone to open the cabinet even a little (when properly installed).  Best of all they have an unlock lever so you can set them to unlock when the children are grown or not around.",5
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","Except for the fact that this is priced really low, I could not find any other reason for getting this monitor. It was a good thing that we got it as a gift. After using it, we thought of keeping our Fisher Price monitor in the registry.Some of the problems with this monitor are:- generally flimsy construction.- lack of a clip or a flat base on both receiver and monitor. Makes it really difficult to place it somewhere.- because of the level of white noise you have to keep the volume up quite high- since there is no visual indicator of the noise level, you have no option but to listen to the hissing and strain hard to hear if it was your baby crying.I think the Fisher Price models are a much better option.",1
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","We recently bought this monitor to replace aFisher-Price Sounds 'n Lights Monitorwhich died.  This thing sounds like you are listening inside a submarine motoring through the water.  I receive the audio on both channel settings, which is a bit disturbing.  One channel is fainter, but still there.  The background noise almost drowns out any actual noise happening in the room even on the right channel.Pros:- Price.Cons:- Background noise (tons) and very sensitive to interference and how you hold it.- Remote unit takes 9v battery.  AA/AAA batteries are more economical and easier to get rechargables for.- Bulky.. Long antenna.  Not as compact as our last unit.Overall: 2 of 5 stars.  Barely works.  Lots of noise.  Will try to return it.",2
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","We've had this monitor for 20 months now and it still works great.  We don't have them too far apart (base is in baby's room on second floor, the other part is on the first floor).  No problems at all, and it's inexpensive compared to the other monitors.",5
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White",Does it's job. I can't take it outside with me and it works pretty well. Good investment for cheap. Thank you.,4
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","This montior will work well for basic, occasional use. I have a smaller home and have used this monitor when baby is napping to go outside and do yard work. I have been about 40 to 50 feet away and the monitor has worked perfectly for us. Batteries seem to last quite a while too. It is lighter weight and probably would hold up too well if it were dropped frequently but this isn't something that we will use for more than a year or 2.",3
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","I purchased this monitor to replace a more expensive one that we lost in a house fire.  I am very impressed with it considering the price.  It is quiet and I can hear more in this one than I could the more expensive one.  I have it sitting up on  a high dresser, my daughters bed is at least 10 foot away if not more and I can actually hear her breathing loud and clear.",5
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White",This monitor really is crystal clear. We went through 3 other monitors before finding this one. No noise except baby. We have been using this monitor for 4 years and it still works great.,5
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","I bought this for us to be able to hear my daughter when we went outside for a smoke break. It worked at first, but when we moved her to her own room it stopped working. Not going to buy this monitor again.",1
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","I never write reviews but this time I have to be fair to other parents ... this is the worst baby monitor! Don't buy it :( .. it is cheap so you may go by that like I did and it is not worth it.. you will have to buy a different one anyway and spend more money.It almost allways have static .. constant static that I can't hear my baby. Sometimes the static stops but it is random. I have moved it to other places in the house and it is the same problem :s.I had a different brand first but then we moved houses and I lost one piece of the monitor and I had to buy this ""Safety 1st"" one .. I so miss my old one, I am actually in Amazon right now to buy it (Graco imonitor Vibe).Regards,Yellow",1
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White",This is the worse. The volume level is terrible. It's almost as if you need to put the receiver to your ear like headphones to hear anything. I definitely would like to have a refund for this crap!,1
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","I have to say that I am very impressed with this monitor.  I can't believe that for under $20 this monitor works awesome.  My son uses a fan for white noise and I thought that was going to be a problem with the monitor.  Yes, you can hear the fan, but it also picks up every noise that my son makes too...without static.  We also live on a half acre lot and I was able to take the monitor to the end of the lot line to do some yard work and could still hear my baby with no problems.  So, if you want a BASIC monitor, I would highly recommend this one.  I would have given the rating 5 stars if the parent unit used a battery other than a 9V and had a shorter antenna.  I had to go out and buy a battery specifically for the monitor and the antenna makes the monitor difficult to wear on a belt.",4
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","I got this monitor to put in our bedroom because that is where our baby is sleeping until she is sleeping through the night and can go into the room with her older sister. I just wanted an inexpensive monitor to get us by until she was moved into her sister's room with our video monitor. This monitor turned out to be so much better than I expected. It picks up the slightest of noises, has been completely clear and we get great reception all over our house (upstairs and down) and outside. I can even hear the clock ticking through the monitor!!! I like it so much I'm going to purchase another one for our guest room downstairs so that I can nap the baby down there when I'm playing with my toddler downstairs. Great monitor for the price!",5
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","We got this monitor for free so I did not expect much from it. However, the first time we used it, I was amazed by how well it worked! We could hear everything that was going on in the baby's room--even the words to the songs playing on the radio that was playing softly in the far corner of the room. The volume is adjustable, so it is perfect during the night when you do not want to be awoken to the sounds of a screaming baby. Both the transmitter and receiver are compact enough to place anywhere in the house and to pack when traveling--you can even wear the receiver. Another plus is that you have a choice of plugging them into an outlet or using batteries. It's a great monitor especially for the price!",5
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","I have had this monitor for 2 years and still use it for my son at night. It has performed wonderfully, but I thought I should illustrate to other users the range that this monitor has, and the one quirk I've noticed with it:If the receiver is on, but the monitor in the baby's room is off, it can pick up other frequencies. We have heard one of our neighbors' baby crying over our monitor when our son wasn't home! I'm not sure if she has the same monitor and is using the same frequency, or what; but be warned that the range on this thing is amazing! (Just be careful to turn your monitor/receiver off if you don't want neighbors to eavesdrop!)",4
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","I originally bought this because the price was great.  I knew that I could take it back if I wasn't happy with it.When I first turned it on, I thought &quot;Great, lots of static, it's going back.&quot;  I plugged in the monitor in a room with a TV to test it out.  When the receiver warmed up a little, I could hear the TV show 'crystal clear'.  No static.I like the fact that the receiver has a belt clip so I can check the mail or do the dishes and be able to clearly hear every thing in the nursery.",5
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","I'm very impressed by the audio on this unit.  You can really hear the smallest noise, even a clock ticking in a different room than the transmitter!I also bought this unit because both the transmitter and receiver can be AC powered or battery powered, so it's versatile as to where you can use it.The only downside is if you try to sleep with this on, the audio tends to get buzzy sometimes, some sort of interference.  Moving or reorienting the receiver seems to help, but it's a pain to have to fiddle with it.  Seems like with some digital signal processing or digital tuning that could be eliminated, but then again this is not an expensive unit so I don't expect miracles.",4
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","The unit, as received, was barely able to pick up sound.  I opened the transmitter unit and found that the transmitter unit had been assembled before the glue that holds the microphone in place had dried. The microphone had slipped out of its mounting hole and was glued in sideways.  I glued the microphone into the mounting hole facing forward in the mounting hole, and now it works right.Be sure you unplug the transmitter before you take it apart to fix it.",1
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","Just like so many others we got this free with a $75 purchase at Toys R Us. I don't think it is very clear or has a great range. Like someone else said, &quot;You can hear the baby breathe but there is also a static sound like air rushing through. If you can sleep with &quot;white noise,&quot; you may be OK but it drives me nuts.&quot;Our other monitor has a rechargable battery which is SO much nicer!  It means you can actually walk around with the monitor.  This monitor eat batteries so who cares if it has a belt clip.  We only use it plugged in (mostly when we travel to a friends house for the weekend so we can keep the good monitor set up at home!)",2
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White",We received this monitor for free and I can see why...it's worthless.  All we can hear from this thing is static.  Too bad I can't rate this thing less than 1 star.,1

It works.",5
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","Pros:- Mucho mejor que otros m&aacute;s costosos.- La se&ntilde;al es clara y con gran alcance.- El micr&oacute;fono tiene buena sensibilidad.- La bater&iacute;a rinde lo suficiente, no representa un gasto excesivo, aunque es mejor utilizarlo con su transformador DC.Cons:- Alg&uacute;n ruido el&eacute;ctrico puede afectar la claridad, no es precisamente un problema del equipo, sino del cableado del edificio o la proximidad de una de las unidades a otro equipo que emita radiofrecuencias, f&aacute;cil de solucionar reorientando o cambiando la unidad a otra toma.- Ambas frecuencias, I y II son pr&aacute;cticamente iguales, en caso de requerir cambiarla por ruido o rango, no es tan efectivo como se espera, aunque un regulador de voltaje o un filtro de ruido electr&oacute;nico limpiar&aacute; la se&ntilde;al mejor.Es tan bueno que ahora compr&eacute; otro para regalar a mi hermana, lo recomiendo much&iacute;simo.",4
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White",I went to toys r us to see if you can use batteries in the baby unit you can not. I did find this same monitor somewhere else that you could use batteries so I bought it. I need a monitor that was portable. I found this to be a good basic monitor. I am able to hear my eight year at night with his breathing problems. I have found Safety 1st monitors to be the best you can buy. I also have use ""grow with me monitor"" by safety 1st its the best. I did not like fisher price monitor that becomes portable too much interference and stat with strange beeping noise out of blue. So if you look for cheap and good this crystal clear is great. There is NO interferance noise nothing but baby with this one.,3
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","We've had this monitor about a year now and it works wonderfully! It's a great relief getting this one as a second monitor after our old Fisher Price Sounds and Lights monitor has had us tearing our hair out for the past three years... what a piece of junk!

"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","When we were expecting our daughter in 2004 we had planned to get an nice (expensive) monitor for her room but when we bought her furniture this monitor was a free gift.  So we thought... well try it and if it sucks... we didn't pay anything and we will go get the one we want.  We were very surprised, my daughter is 15 months old now and we still use this same monitor.  It may not be the greatest or the most expensive out there but it does the job... lets us know when she is up.  I am expecting our second daughter in June and will probably just stick with this monitor b/c it is inexpensive and my last one works just fine.Worth much more than we paid (which was $0.00)",4

Pay more and get something that works well or risk getting something barely usable...and GREATLY annoying.",1

I wanted to be able to have some freedom to roam around another room and be able to listen for her in case she needed me.  The monitor wasn't that expensive, so I wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised that  this monitor picks up every noise in the room.  There is also a clip so you can attatch it to yourself and not be contained to one room of the house.  It can either be plugged in or ran by batteries.  I couldn't be more pleased with the monitor.  I would recommend it because it is worth every cent.",5

This monitor was about 1/2 the price of any other one I could find, and I was definitely looking for something inexpensive.  So, if you are on a tight budget, this is a good option.

I have to change it every three to four days, and we really don't use the battery option much.  It stays plugged in all night long.  It's full of static and the volume control is difficult to manipulate.  I like to have it turned down really low so I can only hear my two month old wake up, I don't want to hear his snoring or breathing all night long.  But there is no in between setting, it's either turned up all the way, or down too low to hear crying.  It is flimsy and difficult to get the receiver to stand alone (it tends to fall over).I want to spend the money and purchase a better unit, that's why I'm browsing the internet for monitors right now.",2

However, she is very vocal when she wants to come inside, and I have to basically sit nearby to get her in. So I purchased this.I tried it out today, and it worked perfectly! It is very sensitive to sounds, I could hear birds tweeting, children talking, and I heard the meow clear as if she was next to me. For me, that made it totally worth it.However, there is white noise. A lot. It can be annoying if you wanted to sleep with it, but if you don't mind it while working or whatnot, then this is a great purchase.

"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White",I love the Crystal Clear Nursery Monitor. I buy them for all of my friends when they are having a baby. I can not wait til I get one for my new baby. I think every parent would enjoy one on there home. It's easy to use and works great.,5
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White",Pretty good monitor for the price. It makes an annoying noise sometimes that I can't figure out - like static. But overall we use this monitor when we travel and it works well,4
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","This monitor crackled all the time, you can't hear the baby over the crackle noise. It the monitor and receiver were to close together (one room apart) they would squeel.",1
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White",This Monitor gets BAD interference! Very buzzy with static! I would not recommend it. I gave it 2 stars because it's super affordable ... but you don't want to buy it unless you really don't mind the interference and constant buzz.,2
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","This monitor is analog, so if you're having static or something, just rotate it a little, or move it. Ours works great, and is crystal clear most of the time. Sometimes there is a little static and then I remember I paid less than $17 for it so I shut up. I would buy again any day.",5
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","I do in-home health care for a disabled elderly woman for a living, and we use this monitor at night while she is sleeping in her room.  Unfortunately, I wasn't in charge of purchasing a monitor, or we'd have a better one-- this model has SO many problems.  The battery drains don't factor in, as we plug it in, but otherwise the unit is very sketchy. If it's not turned up all the way, we can barely hear when our patient wakes up-- and she rattles around the lamp on her nightstand quite loudly.  If it is turned up all the way, there's almost always a constant static buzz, and it doesn't matter where we move the monitor/receiver, or which channel it is on.  Also, if anything else is plugged in to the same outlet, or even an outlet on the same circuit breaker, the receiver starts to hiss and spit static so loud that I couldn't hear the poor woman if she screamed.  The only pro about this system and the reason it gets two stars is that I've never overheard a cordless phone conversation, or had a problem when the wireless router in the adjoining duplex is on. However, if either residence happens to be using a microwave oven, there's a buzzing and clicking sound on the receiver.  This also happens if I so much as touch the power supply cord.If you only plan on using this item while you're asleep with no other electronics in use, it's great.  Otherwise, go for a different brand.",2
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","This monitor is loud! It gets the job done, but there's a lot of white noise that comes off this thing.",2
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White",I read lots of reviews before purchasing this monitor. My grand daughter is now 11 months old and I watch her during the day while her parents are at work. During the day she takes two naps. She always wakes happy but before the monitor I did not hear her until she cried. Now I am able to clearly hear when she wakes and begins playing with her crib toys and am able to respond before she becomes stressed. Also I know exactly when she drifts off to sleep. There is occasional static but it is very low. My daughter-in-law spent a lot more money for something not nearly as good. In my opinion for the money this is the absolute best product on the market hands down.,5
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","I bought this about two months ago.  So far, it seems to work pretty good.  What I have noticed is that if you place it near a cell phone you get a weird scrambly noise.  Also, when I try to use my cell while the receiver is on, I tend to get really bad reception on my phone and I've even dropped a couple of calls.  I really only use it when the baby is napping and I want to go outside (he's loud and I can hear him from anywhere in the house), and the battery light just came on the other day, so it's kind of a battery sucker!  Yes, I've had it for two months, but I really don't use it that often (maybe 30 minutes every other day) so the battery should be good for a while longer!  But other then those, it picks up the baby very well!  I can hear him clearly even when he's just quietly talking to himself.  I also don't have to turn the volume up very much.  Over all, it works for what I need it for, but I wouldn't recommend this for someone who wants to constantly monitor their child, unless you've got tons of extra 9 volts or are near an outlet for the ac adapter!",4
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","This unit is decent, but the build quality is flimsy.  It is very static-y.  It is ok if you can get it on sale but I would suggest a higher quality model if you can afford it.",3
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White",The monitor is good for the most part but I also pick up my neighbors baby when they are in their garage with their monitor!!!! The first time this happened my husband was spooked because our baby was not even home so that was a big issue for us. In certain areas of our home we get a loud humming in our receiver so much so that we can barely hear the baby,3
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","Sometimes it's not worth going the cheap route and after having this monitor for a week, it further reinforced the idea that cheap products lead to cheap results.  First of all it ate up the 9 volt battery within four days.  Secondly, there was so much static that it drove my husband and I crazy.  Yes, we changed the channel, but it was the same static as before.  If the static doesn't bother you then go for it.  Otherwise it's not worth the money we saved.",1

"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White",I had tried four others that were much more expensive prior to using this monitor. The others were FULL of static and didn't pick up a thing until my little guy was screaming. I can hear the softest of noises when I'm awake but the volume does turn down low enough that I don't wake up to every little sigh at night. This is a GREAT value!,5
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","PURCHASED THIS BABY MONITOR SO THAT I COULD HEAR THE DOORBELL WHILE I WAS IN OUR OFFICE IN THE BASEMENT AS I HAD MISSED 2 DELIVERIES THAT HAD TO BE SIGNED FOR.  THIS MONITOR WORKS GREAT.  IT IS VERY SENSITIVE AND EVEN PICKS UP THE SOUND OF AIR COMING THROUGH THE AC/HEAT VENTS.  AN ADDED BONUS IS THE CHIME OF THE GRANDFATHER CLOCK TO ALERT ME TO THE TIME.  DON'T WANT TO MISS MEALS.  I TOLD MY COUSIN ABOUT THIS AND HE IS GETTING ONE FOR HIS BASEMENT MANCAVE.  SINCE YOU CAN CARRY IT AROUND, YOU COULD USE IT IN THE GARAGE MOWING, ON THE PATIO OR ANYWHERE WITHIN THE RANGE.  FOR THE PRICE, IT IS AN EXCELLENT VALUE.  THANK YOU.",5
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","I agree with the bulk of the other reviewers, this is hands-down a very good product and the price is great.I'm using this monitor to care for a elderly parent.  The sound is so clear that I can actually hear them walk.I just wish they had additional hand sets instead of buying another monitor for another handset.",5
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","I bought this because we desperately needed a monitor and couldn't afford to spend that much. At first it seemed to good to be true. Worked beautifully, clear and no static. 2 months later it just stopped picking up my baby and I could hear our neighbors in the next door apartment. Now all it picks up is static and if I adjust the volume button up and down just right I can faintly pick up my daughters room. Bought it at target so can't return, not sure of this seller on amazons policy but just spend the extra$  and get a decent monitor.",1
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White",Glad we didn't spend more money for a monitor. Only wish it had a third monitor. Love it.  It's not too noisy either like our previous one.,4
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","I ordered this monitor to replace one that we misplaced when we traveled to my in-law's house.  I got it and set it up, and it didn't even work!  I spent hours on the phone with the Safety 1st costumer service, who told me it was probably my Wi-Fi that was interfering with it.  Really?!?  Don't you think it would be a problem to sell a monitor that doesn't work if you have Wi-Fi?  Also, there was no static or anything.  I shut down the Wi-Fi and tried again, still no luck.  It was just defective.  I contacted the seller through Amazon and they did give me a refund.  If you get a defective one like I did, don't try to work with their customer service!  It will just infuriate you!  I guess I'll go buy a different monitor now.",1
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White",I am giving this as a gift so I hope it will be ok.  It looks like it would be and is suppose to work up to 600 feet.,4
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","I don't think that they should call this a &#34;crystal clear monitor&#34; As the other reviewers mentioned this product is pretty staticy. On a low volume setting, I can still hear my baby  when he makes noise but the static isnt bad. I just needed something basic to use and that is what I got. If you are looking for somehting with no static - get another product.",3
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","This monitor worked fine for us, for a couple of months. But after awhile, the plug on the receiver started cracking and coming apart. When we would try to pull it out of our outlets, the plastic would seperate, exposing the wiring inside. The wires themselves were thin and seemed flimsy. We had to buy a new monitor this week to replace this one (our son is only 8 months old).",2
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","My recommendation on child number 3, with monitor #3, is to skip this one. Our twins had hand me down Sony monitors two years ago that were at least 4 years old from the neighbors (two gracious families). They had used the Sony monitors for years before passing them to us. We got this model with number 3 because the twin ones are still in play throughout the house. I have since returned this model. It uses 9v battery whereas the Sony is rechargable- all you do is plug it in to recharge. That cord comes off so Sony is complately portable without a power source, but holds the charge for days. The Sony unit beeps when the charge is low.This unit (Safety 1st) is NOT rechargeable and wastes battery power. It does not stay charged. It does not notify you the charge is low until you hear the top-of-lung desperate wail of a baby tired of crying. This monitor also did not have good range. I hated it.",1
Prince Lionheart Fireplace Guard with Two Corners,"I know this is a bit long but read it if you're concerned that the item won't stick to bricks and/or you want to cover the whole surface of a raised hearth.  I knew it was futile to even try to attach the product to the old bricks I have.  Further, I wasn't only concerned with the edges but the entire raised hearth I have.  The corners are only marginally more dangerous than the rest of the hard surface in my opinion.  So I purchased some quarter inch plywood and cut it to cover the whole surface plus extra for the front and both sides where I attached 1x2 pine.  The contraption fit snugly over the fireplace so it doesn't move if someone steps on it.  I attached the cushions to the edges (which stuck perfectly to the all wood surface).  Then I attached some extra carpet I had with carpet tape to cover the rest of the exposed plywood.  It looks great.  It cost me about $10 in materials, took a little over an hour to make, and I can remove the whole thing when I want to use the fireplace.",4
Prince Lionheart Fireplace Guard with Two Corners,"I bought this product to protect my son. As soon as he could maneuver himself over to the fireplace, the first thing he did was rip the strips off.  They dont adhere well to brick and did not fit together properly.  It was a total waste of money.",1
Prince Lionheart Fireplace Guard with Two Corners,These guards are high quality and provide the protection we need for our active grandchildren.  I would recommend them to anyone.,5
Prince Lionheart Fireplace Guard with Two Corners,"I was very disappointed in these.  They are cheap foam, which I will suppose will do the trick, but I guess I expected something of a little better quality.  But, my gripe is with the tape provided, it doesn't stick to brick.  If you have a brick fireplace, like most people do, be forewarned, you will need to find a better way to attach these, which I have yet to find.  You would think the manufacturer would have thought of that in advanced seeing as how the vast majority of fireplaces, and their surrounds, are brick or stone.  Apparently, logic and common sense failed them in the design.",1
Prince Lionheart Fireplace Guard with Two Corners,"I also purchased the bumper for my table, made by the same company. The only difference is width of the bumpers. The Fireplace bumper is a lot wider, but same thickness. The bumpers stick very well and don't fall off. My son likes to stand up and sit down a lot near the brick base of the fireplace and he is constantly bumping hi knees against it. It works great and cushions his knee every time. I give it a 4 instead of 5 stars because it would be nice if there was an option for other colors. Other than that, great product.",4
Prince Lionheart Fireplace Guard with Two Corners,"We just set up the product and LOVE it!  It is fabulous just what we where looking for to protect our two small boys!  Our youngest just started crawling and we knew we needed something to protect him from the sharp edges of our marble fire place.  I  can see why some might have trouble with the adhesive sticking to `brick'  However, we have  polished marble and have had NO problems at ALL with it.  We HIGHTLY recommend this product!  Money WELL spent!",5
Prince Lionheart Fireplace Guard with Two Corners,"I think it's worth the purchase.  Target had these for much more money.  So far, it's stayed on and where it is attached is made out of cement.  I didn't have to use extra adhesive and my son already pulled one piece off, it went back on and stayed there (2 months now).  When you cut them to size, I suggest scissors.  The directions say use a serated knife but it just made a mess.  Good luck.",4
Prince Lionheart Fireplace Guard with Two Corners,"These cushions seem pricey, but they were the only ones we could find to buy, and going without some type of cushion on our brick hearth wasn't an option.  My 11 mo. old daughter started to pull a piece off the other day, but then she gave up and I pushed the piece back down fine.  What I really love about this product is the color of the foam that really blends right in with our living room decor, and the foam can be easily cut to fit perfectly, which we had to do.  My daughter loves to crawl up and sit on the hearth, and in her exuberance she's tumbled off before.  This cushion has directly protected her head a few times.",5
Prince Lionheart Fireplace Guard with Two Corners,On a tile step down with little ones around these guards have worked wonderfully.  Wish they came in longer lengths for those areas as used two sections to cover the area.,5
Prince Lionheart Fireplace Guard with Two Corners,Had sharp edges on brick hearth  protects well from my ever curious grandson and gives a nice finish to edge,5
Prince Lionheart Fireplace Guard with Two Corners,I bought this to attach to my large picture window sill. It stops my dogs from scratching the paint. Attached easily and plenty of length.,5
Prince Lionheart Fireplace Guard with Two Corners,"The concept is great, but the product isn't.  The pads have a lot of cushioning, but they don't stay on the hearth (we have a brick hearth).  My son constantly pulls them off - the adhesive needs to be improved greatly.",2
Prince Lionheart Fireplace Guard with Two Corners,"My son's head has already been ""saved"" a number of times by this bumper.  Easy to cut and install.  I used the extra on our coffee table, and it's a lifesaver for a new stander/cruiser.  My son pulled off other bumpers, but has not had success ripping this one off (yippee!).  - fyi, our fireplace is slate -",5
Prince Lionheart Fireplace Guard with Two Corners,"We bought this to put on our fireplace hearth to keep our one year old from hitting the edge. It went on very easily and we have had no problems with it coming off, even with her pulling on it. I think that it may be a little overpriced, but we paid it. A good product.",4
Prince Lionheart Fireplace Guard with Two Corners,Keeps our baby from hurting her head when she falls near the fireplace and keeps us from having a heart attach when she falls.,5
Prince Lionheart Fireplace Guard with Two Corners,"1)was not long enough to fit a standard fireplace2)the sticky adhesive doesn't stick and baby pulled it off so easily3)once it's off it will not stick again(useless)Waste of money, very cheap-looking.Would not recommend!!",1
Prince Lionheart Fireplace Guard with Two Corners,Worked very well for when my son began walking at around 12 months and would fall into everything.  I purchased the colour that best matched our fireplace mantel,5
Prince Lionheart Fireplace Guard with Two Corners,"The guard is made up of two parts, the foam and the double-sided tape.  Fortunately, the foam is high quality and very dense.  If it would attach properly, I'm sure it would work well.  However, the double-sided tape is a joke.  It comes in a solid sheet that needs torn off.  It is very difficult to remove the paper cover without ending up with a ball of tape.  If this product had better tape, I would rate it a 5.  But with this tape it is definitely a 1.",1
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - White,I really like the Simmons changing pad cover.  The cover is very soft and really washes up nice.  I have had no problems with shrinking or anything.  I would highly recommend this to new parents.  I would also recommend buying atleast 3 of them because there is always laundry to do.,5
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - White,"I have an 18 month old and never used these covers. It is just an extra thing to wash and buy. Why would it be necessary to protect a diaper pad anyway? The vinyl does not get stained, and I wipe it down with a disinfectant wipe occassionally. The vinyl is much simpler and easy to clean.",1
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - White,"I bought two of these covers in white and prewashed them both like the directions stated. They seem to have shrunk a little. Either that or they were not the right size before I washed them. They do cause the corners of the pad to smash down, but after laying my son on it, it seems to fit just fine. They are very soft and my son has fallen asleep on the changing table many times. If he likes it that is all that's important to me!",4
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - White,"Granted, I was trying to use this Simmons cover on a Dex changing pad, but the Babies-R-Us sales guy said it would fit just fine!  It doesn't.  And I swear that it has shrunk since I have been using and washing it.  The Dex cover is much roomier, softer, AND has reinforced holes for the straps!  One nice feature about this Simmons cover, however, is that it comes in a variety of colors.",3
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - White,I think it is a great buy. You get something on it just through it in the washer and put on a clean one you need at least 2 to keep it one always handy. Diapering 2 babies this sure make life easier.,5
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - White,"These are really thick, soft pads and work great. They do shrink a little when washed the first time, but they still fit on the changing pad just fine. I have two other ones that are different brands and they are much thinner and not nearly as plush as this one.",5
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - White,"As far as the safety straps, it took me 2 seconds to realize that the straps are attached underneath and therfore there is NO need for the slits, I have the pink one on my changing table and the straps are fine and secure. I love this product, it dresses up baby's room and I intend on getting more.",5
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - White,I purchased two of these civers. After just two washings they both shrunk so bad in the dryer (gentle setting) that I can no longer use them. I just leave the pad as is with no cover on it it is much easier to clean that way anyway.,1
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - White,"I just finished washing two of these covers for the first time, and put one on my changing pad. I was happy to discover that despite the negative reviews I read it fits perfectly. Due to the odd shape of the contoured pad, it did take a few moments to get into the right place.As for the softness, it feels like terry cloth and seems perfectly soft enough. And despite other reviews, it is rather thick...I wouldn't have minded if it was a bit thinner actually.I also haven't had any issue with the straps and the lack of holes, since they are attached at the bottom of the pad and fit over the cover.",5
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - White,I have nothing negative to say about this one - I bought 2 and love it! I think it is holding up well.,5
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - White,"My husband and I purchased the contoured changing pad because of the contoured shape and its thickness.  We also bought multiple terry covers...our first son so we bought a lot without knowing what works and what doesn't.We stopped using the terry covers after needing to wash them so many times due to our son's ""accidents"" and our ""slow first-time-parent diaper changes"":) Washing them so much was a hastle as we had to rinse them each time and they still stained with BM's.  We found using the pad without the covers worked best and just used a folded paper towel under our son's bottom to soak any ""accidents"" then we wiped clean the pad with baby wipes after each diaper change.Also the terry covers cover the safety straps...not a good idea if you want to use the staps.Although we only used for a short time, they became worn qwick...5 washes or so.  Also, like other have mentioned, the theads started to fray.  I'm glad we ditched these and just changed our son on the vinal pad.Happy shopping",1
Crisp &amp; Clear Plus Rechargeable 900MHz Monitor,"I can't move 5 feet from the baby unit without the parent unit bursting out static because, as the light on the parent unit tells me, I'm &quot;out of range.&quot; This product is really useless.",1
Crisp &amp; Clear Plus Rechargeable 900MHz Monitor,"While I generally like this monitor, there are times I want to throw it out the door. It picks up all noises in our daughter's nursery, but it also picks up our neighbors conversations on their cordless phones. No kidding. I can't talk on my own cordless phone and have this monitor next to me. Too much static. We also live in the path of an airfield, so the monitor has annoying static from the planes.  (Sunday evenings are the worst, because of the heavy air traffic.) I guess it's best for those in the country... not a highly populated city.",3
Crisp &amp; Clear Plus Rechargeable 900MHz Monitor,"I purchased this monitor because during the summer my son plays with the neighbor's kids on our dead end street and I wanted something that I could walk down a couple houses and would know when they baby woke up. This monitor is 900 MHz and should have been good for 400 feet or so it says. Dispite some of the reviews saying people got static with this monitor I purchased it anyway. Most of the people said that it was a problem with their cordless telephone and I knew that wasn't a big factor for me. Anyhow, this monitor worked great if I was inside the house.  I tested it by puting the monitor base next to a tv and as soon as I was 20 feet outside the house I got nothing but static. I thought one nice feature that this monitor had was a light that lit up if you were out of range, well I was no where out of range and couldn't hear a thing. I wound up returning it and purchasing the Fisher Price Long Range Monitor, which it also 900 MHz but says it's good for 1,000 feet. It's a couple dollars cheaper and works soooo much better. The Crisp &amp; Clear has some nice features that the Fisher Price one does not but what does it matter if you can't hear the baby, right? There are too many other monitors out there to waste your money on this one.",2
Crisp &amp; Clear Plus Rechargeable 900MHz Monitor,"I have owned the Crisp &quot;N Clear Plus monitor for a year and  half now and I have had great use of it.  It clearly catches every sound around the baby.  I've never had a problem with static except when I try taking it outdoors, but I can take it around my two story house and be able to hear my daugther loud and clear. Even after its numerous falls it still works pretty good (it does get bad static if you use it near a cordless phone though). I've never had a problem with the battery getting discharged and I do use it pretty often for long periods of time.  Bottom line, lets be realistic, there is no such thing as &quot;perfect&quot; reception when it comes to a baby's monitor.  And what works for one person doesn't work for another, but you could give it a try and find out if it works for you.",4
Crisp &amp; Clear Plus Rechargeable 900MHz Monitor,We tried this monitor but it did not work consistently.  The static was really awful!,1
Crisp &amp; Clear Plus Rechargeable 900MHz Monitor,"This monitor was the best we've tried(in the end-4 bought &amp; 3 returned) It is very clear- as it's name points out. The pros- very clear,both units are slim-not bulky like nost, baby's unit stands up or lays flat, comes WITH rechargable batteries,doesn't pick up much outside noise. My biggest problem is that if the parent &amp; baby units are too close, espically with the parent unit on a high setting, they both give a shreaking noise- but that can easily be avoided.",5
Crisp &amp; Clear Plus Rechargeable 900MHz Monitor,"This monitor is AWFUL.  Sure I can hear my baby but the static this monitor produces is just horrible.  You can't possibly sleep with this monitor on.  You will constantly be woken up by the static.  Having a newborn causes enough sleep deprivation, don't add to it with this monitor!",1
Crisp &amp; Clear Plus Rechargeable 900MHz Monitor,"After my 4-and-a-half year old, used every day, Fisher Price monitor started only transmitting static, no nursery sounds, I replaced it with a F.P. Sound and Lights monitor. While I could actually hear my baby, I had a lot of static, too.  I was beginning to think something was wrong in my house to cause the static. I returned the F.P. and purchased the First Years Crisp and Clear monitor! Wow!  I get perfect reception all the time and it's so sensitive I can even hear my baby breathing.",5
Crisp &amp; Clear Plus Rechargeable 900MHz Monitor,"This is the second monitor we have purchased by The First Years - our old one suffered too many drops and wasn't working as well anymore.  We were pleased with the old model, but this new one is fantastic!  This model has great battery life - the old one would die after about 2 or 3 hours, but this one keeps on going (rechargeable batteries too!!).  It's nice when we are on the porch or watching a movie in the basement and don't have the cord.  Also, we spend a lot of time doing yard work and this monitor can reach past the edges of our yard - even when we thought we would get interference with power lines it kept on going (the old one didn't make it that far).  Finally, you can hear our baby sigh when he sleeps, it's so much clearer than the other models we tried.  All this in a small and attractive monitor.The only downside?  On ours we can't quite turn the volume all the way down (so we can just watch for the lights) - that would be nice when we are watching a movie while the music is still playing in our son's room at night.  Not a big deal though.Give it a try - I think you have to try a couple to see what will work in your house with your circumstances (phones, interference, etc.).  We love this one though!",5
Crisp &amp; Clear Plus Rechargeable 900MHz Monitor,"I registered for this monitor since I saw it highlited in Baby Bargains book, had rechargable batteries  and it was rather inexpensive but am very disappointed with it's performance.  I can not hear my daughter breathing and have to put the unit up to my ear to hear well.  I also hear a lot of buzzing and frequently it goes out of range when the receiver has not even been moved!!",1
Crisp &amp; Clear Plus Rechargeable 900MHz Monitor,"The positive: The monitor is certainly sensitive. I could hear my son's breathing and little sighs easily with the monitor on 4.The negatives: There was static from the thing--always. Also, on random nights we would hear odd little blips about 2 seconds apart. Did I try turning off appliances, etc.? Yes. Did I move the monitor to different locations? Yep. In addition to being curious about what was causing these sounds, I never could figure out the reason why the blip happened on some nights and not on others.Also, I recently discovered that if I changed the channel my husband and I were treated to the goings-on of little ""Jackie"" and his parents, who apparently live somewhere in our neighborhood. I really do hope that they weren't able to listen in to us. The final straw was the loud interference the monitor would emit when I turned on a fan in my son's room. Again, this was a recent discovery.I returned the thing today and bought a Graco model. So far, so good.",2
Crisp &amp; Clear Plus Rechargeable 900MHz Monitor,"I purchased this monitor while expecting my 2nd child.  I currently use another brand for my toddler and have never had any issues with static, etc.  I found compared to the current monitor I use, that the sound quality on this one was very poor with little depth to the sound.  It was difficult to discern normal crib movement versus him making noise. It frequently got interference and turned to static even though I use it in the next bedroom over!  I did like the small, slim and convenient size though.  I ended up returning it and purchasing another brand.",3
Crisp &amp; Clear Plus Rechargeable 900MHz Monitor,This is the worst monitor i have ever used and i've tried a few different ones.  I am returning it because of the static.  You don't need to get static - do not buy this monitor!,1
Safety 1st Railnet,We bought this for our banister. Did not work for our needs. You basically get a stack of string to tie it on with. We tied it on and it left gaps everywhere and our daughter could basically slide her hands over the top and Yank it down. Also where the banister meets the wall we got it as close as we could but since it ties on we could only get it about an inch from the wall at the closest. Our daughter easily pushed right past it. We returned it for a refund after just a few days.,2
Safety 1st Railnet,It's been good enough for what I needed it for. It also holds up to the outdoor weather pretty well.,4
Safety 1st Railnet,We truly like this item. We are no longer fearful that our grandkids or our 6 lb Yorkie will fall.,5
Safety 1st Railnet,"I was VERY disappointed when receiving this product and returned it immediately.  I needed something to cover 22' of banister, and this was not going to do the trick.  It seemed flimsy and I didn't feel safe putting it up.  Instead, I went to Lowes and purchased a 25' segment of Poultry Fencing (who would have thought?!).  It is MUCH more sturdy and for $15 was a better use of my money.  We zip-tied it to the banister and I am so surprised with the quality.  I do not recommend this product.  Go to Lowes, get a better deal for a safer and better alternative.  And, it doesn't look as bad as I thought!",1
Safety 1st Railnet,This railnet works well in preventing my kids from throwing toys over my stair rail.,4
Safety 1st Railnet,it does what a net should do....we set it up on our balcony.  Nothing more to add here as it's a net.,5
Safety 1st Railnet,"We got this for a long railing in our split-entry home that has larger gaps in between spindles that would easily allow even a toddler to pass through.  I first tried using the supplied string to attach the netting to the railing, but it was difficult to get tight knots, especially after my daughter would push on the netting.  I resorted to using zip-ties which I know can deal with the abuse this netting will take.  The reinforced edging is sufficient for normal pulling, but if you really went crazy I'm sure you could rip it.The eye screws supplied worked well for going through my carpeting into the subfloor to tie the netting to the floor.  Overall I like the design, I just thought the strings were pretty crappy.  It would have been better with a lengthy piece of string that you could run around the railing in a spiral pattern to catch every loop, and would require a lot less knot tying.",4
Safety 1st Railnet,RailnetThe railnet was easy to install and was effective protecting our grandson from getting between the railing.It also has been built with quality in mind.,4
Safety 1st Railnet,This net has been a huge relief for keeping our little one from falling through the 1960's railing that is spaced too far apart.  Nice to have found an alternative that doesn't require destroying the hall to put it in place.,5
Safety 1st Railnet,"I bought this for my porch railing so my cat couldn't stick his head and shoulders off the third floor balcony.  It was easy to install with the many, many strings included and the eye hooks helped in corners.  It feels pretty stable, though I don't know if I'd use it with children who would actually test its strength, unlike my 12-pound cat.  It doesn't detract from my view or his and it doesn't make my porch ugly, so I like it!  And it's a great alternative to all the extremely expensive guards that are sold.  Definitely recommend!",5
Safety 1st Railnet,Used this so my son wouldn't fall through the railing once he started crawling.  He put his face into it and plenty of pressure on it and it held up perfectly.  We even took it down once he got too big to fall through and it is now being reused at my sisters home.,5
Safety 1st Railnet,"The railnet is super. My 10 month old seems to have super strength,but when it comes to him trying to push through the railnet, it stops him. I have mine secured to my spindles of an open staircase. The railnet is easy to &quot;put up&quot; and it's extremely light weight. One person can do it. I recommend it.",5
Safety 1st Railnet,Brilliant product. Very easy and quick to install. Would definitely recommend this product. Very reasonably priced compared to other options.,5
Safety 1st Railnet,"We have a lot of rails in our house, including a loft with a long drop. This is the perfect product to keep kids from falling. The anchors screw into the wood at the base of the rail, and the ties are super durable. This has been tested by my VERY active 2 year old, and it's kept her from falling.",5
Safety 1st Railnet,It works great but was a little time consuming to tie on.  Great for peace of mind since my baby is crawling everywhere!,4
Safety 1st Railnet,"This net is not the most high tech thing around, but it worked well for our needs. We have a white banister over a narrow, steep farmhouse stairwell and this fit around the area almost perfect. Putting it up was rather tedious, but if you spend some good time you can make it pretty secure. I can see if you had a more fancy or nice banister, this would not look pretty! Also, we have a pretty low key 2 year old (physically speaking, doesn't push the boundaries).. this totally does the job if you don't have a kid that will purposefully try to work their way through or around it, without shelling out $ for 10 feet of gates.",4
Safety 1st Railnet,"My husband and I were having a hard time figuring out how to keep our daughter safely in her bed at night in our camper.  We tried bedrails and gates and both failed for multiple reasons.  We finally decided to look for some sort of mesh to pull across the 6ft opening.  After an extensive surf on the web, we came across Railnet.  We attached it to two tension rods (rolling the excess) and it worked fantastic.  As for it's intended use, we wouldn't know.  Hope any campers out there found this helpful.",4

"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","My wife and I love these bottles! Easy to clean, aren't leaching chemicals into our baby's food and they are so sturdy! Me and my baby have dropped these bottles on the ceramic floor innumerable times and haven't experienced a breakage yet! Great product!",5
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","We feel better with glass bottles because they are much easier to sterilize, easier to see unwashed areas in the bottles, no grease residue.",5
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","I think the product itself is fine, but I was disappointed to find that the bottles did not come with a cap ring to hold the nipple on. I tried using Dr Brown rings, and they do fit, but they leak. I cannot find rings sold separately anywhere, so I have not been able to use these bottles. In the description of this product, it says that cap rings are included.",3
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","I just assumed that the bottles would be made bigger.  The neck of the bottle is so small that it is hard to pour the powder in without making a mess.  The nipples are a joke.  I do not like this item at all.  Right now, I am just using them to measure water to pour into my smaller bottles.  Definitely not worth even the small amount they are asking for them.  I will buy more of the Born Free next time!!",2
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","These bottles are great. I chose the glass ones because they do not leach any chemicals. I used them from the very beginning with my little one and had no problems with him taking these. Now that he is 6 mo old, I am planning on buy a silicon sleeve and a new tip to convert the bottle into a sippy cup.",5
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","A. These came much more quickly than Amazon said they would -a plus.B. I was doubtful that they would actually fit my Medela Pump 'n Style pump...but they do!  No need to do a cumbersome transfer, which was the only thing keeping me from purchasing them.  Since many of the nutrients and immune factors stay in the plastic bottle, pumping in to plastic and then transfering to glass didn't seem to make much sense...but not a problem with these!C. They're heavy and durable, and I can't imagine them breaking without serious effort.With all the worries about the chemicals in plastics, these have taken a real load off my mind. I recommend them to all mothers, even if they only help with your stress level.  They seem to only be available at Amazon, which is a shame.  While you're looking, dont forget to buy them in the larger size as well:Evenflo Classic 8 oz. Glass Nurser - 6-Pack.  It'll come in handy later.Oh, also: My baby is fine with the nipples that came with them, but he's not really the picky sort.[Edit: After using these for a few months, I have noticed that they get and stay colder than the plastic bottles, and seem to keep the milk in the fridge fresher longer.  Enjoy!]",5
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","I was so excited to receive these glass bottles after I learned about the potential harmful effects of Bisphenol-A leaching from my daughter's plastic bottles. They are so cute! They hold heat really well, and for a lot longer than her plastic ones. They also clean up really easily in the dishwasher which is heaven. My only gripe is that my daughter is 6 months old and is used to silicone nipples so she won't take the latex ones that come with the bottles. I did purchase some 'standard' gerber ones but they ended up leaking. Also the diameter of the nipple is a lot smaller than her old gerber comfort hold bottles so the way she nurses is different than on the new smaller nipples for the glass bottles. My advice is to start your baby early on this glass bottle/nipple combo or be prepared for some adjustment time as your baby learns the new one.",4
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","I've decided to only use glass bottles for my baby after reading about the BPA scare. These bottles work great with Medela breast pump and Medela bottle caps but it doesn't vent as well as the evenflo's original bottle cap. I've experience a couple of leakage, but that's because I didn't screw the cap on tight enough. Initially I was concern about my baby ingesting gas but I realise that if you take your time to burp your baby, gas wouldn't be a problem. My baby used to feed from a Dr Brown bottle, and she still burps! It may be a tad heavy but my 6 month old can hold the 4 oz bottle steady to feed herself.I also love the classic look and the fact that the measurements are heat-stamped onto the glass instead of printed on, so you can sterilize as often as you like without worrying if the prints will wear off. These bottles are definitely made to last.",5
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","I am usually against things made of plastic, even though those without BPA. So I choose these bottles for my baby and so far so good. The only downside is that the slow-flow nipples flow too fast for him and he chokes on them. I had to purchase nipples to fit these bottles and it's hard to find the right ones. I ordered some Dr. Brown standard nipples, hoping to fit the bottles well.",4
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","great glass bottles, only problem i have had with them is the nipples.the silicon evenflow nipples (slow flow) that came with them colapse. i purchased gerber slow flow nipples and they did NOT seal, and would leak pretty bad as soon as the baby started to suck. Not really sure if the problem was the gerber nipples or the size of the ring caps on the bottles.",4
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","They are good except being heavy due to glass design but I guess it is expected. My boy is developing arm muscles now from holding it for few months now. hahaha. Three in a pack is a very good idea, four could have been better though.",4
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","My baby still has a tiny tummy, so these small bottles work well for the amount of pumped milk he can drink at night. Sturdy bottles, bottle nipples work well too.",5
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","I gave my baby pumped milk in Advent bottles but after all the scare with BPA, even buying the bpa-free Advent bottles, I did not want to warm up the milk by sticking the plastic Advent bottles into hot water.  I bought one pack of these glass bottles to warm the milk up in, then I transfered the warmed milk to the plastic bottles.  If I hadn't already spent a fortune on the plastic bottles, I would have purchased 20 of these glass ones and used them as the feeding, and warming bottles.  Buy these in the beginning!  They work and they are worry-free.",5
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","I like that these are glass bottles, but the nipple that is included is way too small.  My son's mouth fits completely over it, and he still has a shallow latch.  He's only 10 weeks old!  I decided to keep the bottles and use them for storage.  You could try pairing the bottles with another nipple as well.  Also, Target sells this pack for $5.",3
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce",I have been doing so much research about plastic bottles and finally broke down and bought these. They are great and so easy to clean if you have a dishwasher! I am so glad that I made the decision to switch they are great and so much healthier for baby! I wish that I would have done this with my first child!,5
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","These bottles are fantastic. BPA free (of course...they're glass), sturdy, easy to clean. My son is 4 months and we haven't had any issues yet. I did order the 'comfi' nipple, as I breast feed and they are more simlar to the breast. Also, these are SO much cheaper than other glass bottles (which I have a few of), and they do the job just as well. I would recommend.....",5
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce",These bottles sucks!  The nipple keeps collasping after every 5 sucks... I keep having to interrupt my baby's feeding after every 5 sucks to fix the nipple...,1
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","I was very happy to find these, and at such a good price, after looking for glass bottles at several retail stores. I have not had any issues with these bottles. I have not tried the nipples that came with them, as I was given specific nipples to use that mimic natural. The outer ring and bottle work with all of the nipples I have. Great product.",5
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","I have used the bottles for four months and really like them.  I have a Medela breast pump and the bottles fit directly on the pump, allowing me to pump directly into the bottle.  I use Dr. Brown's nipples because the ones that come with the bottles seem kind of hard.According to the book, Baby 411, antibodies from breastmilk stick to plastic, but not glass.  I believe the authors of the book recommend glass bottles.",4
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","I love the glass bottles,I now have peace of mind!  During the late night feedings my husband and I just place the glass bottles in the bottle warmer without fear of chemical contamination.  The only down side is that the glass bottles are heavier than the plastic;however, with time your baby will learn how to hold them!!",5
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","We read alot about the BPA concerns and they make us nervous too. We tried Dr. Browns', Avent, Born Free, etc. and when we discovered that Medela nipples do vent when use with Evenflo glass bottles, we are so happy!  Our baby loves this combination too!  This system is economical, BPA-free, and simple (comparing to those of Dr. Browns' and Born Free's). We've been using the system for 5+ months and want to share this with you all...Evenflo glass bottles, made in Mexico ($5 for three) = economically BPA-free!Medela nipples, made in Germany ($5 for three) = soft, right flowing rate (slow or medium) for newborns and infants (you can buy Medela nipples at Babies R Us stores.)One thing to remember is that you should tighten the cap just about right (not too tight) or else the system won't vent.",5
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce",this is the only bottle i will use with my new born baby with everything that is going on in china now.........,5
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","Great bottles, but the nipples get fast after a few weeks of use. Mine are a month old and the milk comes out in a pretty fast steady stream if you tip them over. Not the best for month old infant that needs the slow nipple. Other than the nipple, a great product.",3
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","We switched to all glass bottles and these are our go-to bottles. They are a good shape and size, especially because they fit on my Medela pump. We started with the slow flow nipples but just purchased medium flow ones as our infant is getting older. You can also get rubber covers for these bottles if you want to take them out and are concerned about breakage.They are some of the most affordable glass bottles out there. We love Life Factory bottles but they are much more expensive, so we bought a bunch of these.",5
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","I am glad to have found these glass bottles, but am disappointed that they come with latex nipples, not silicone ones.",4
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce",I love these glass bottles- the same ones my mother used in the 60's and I used in the 80's with my first baby and am using again with my new babies-twins! They just seem cleaner to me- they shine after being washed in the dishwasher.,5
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","Don't plan to carry these around in a bag, because they leak. Also, it's very hard to get the top off of the part that screws on and holds the nipple, it keeps getting stuck and you have to pry it out.",1
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce",I get that glass breaks but these shatter and scatter into a million pieces.  I may be clumsy but they should figure out a way to make these glass bottles as thick as the Avent bottles so they have a better chance when they fall from waist height!,1
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","we are very pleased with the glass baby bottles for they are the best way to keep our newborn baby safe from lead paint cartoons on plastic bottles from china,as well as the toxins from the plastic bottles themselves.we can steam clean the glass bottles,this is the best way to keep our baby's bottles sanitized,without releasing toxins as plastic bottles do. we are pleased by the timely fahion that the bottles were ordered and recieved through amazon.com,and the quality of the product.thank you.",5
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","None of my kids use bottles anymore, but when they did I went through so many brands and types of bottles trying to find one that I liked. My final choice was to settle on these glass bottles. They last so much longer than the plastic bottles. All of the plastic bottles that I tried got to a point where no matter how well I washed them, how hot the water was, even going through the dishwasher didn't get the formula smell out of them. Glass bottles are so much easier to clean, and so much easier to run through the dishwasher. Plus, in the diswasher the plastic bottles were never completely dried in the drying cycle. Not a problem with glass bottles.",5
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","These are simple glass baby bottles.  They're not fancy, but they have no nasty chemicals. I know that the plastic bottles are now all BPA free, but who knows what chemical they'll discover next year that's been leeching out of our plastic and poisoning us all this time.These bottles are compatible with my medela pump and can take the same lids, which is convenient.  However, for a breast-fed baby, even these so-called slow flow nipples are way too fast, and caused my baby to choke.  I bought Dr. Brown's nipples, which work great.  I now have these in 4 oz and 8 oz sizes.",5
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce",I love these bottles!  I had planned to go with the more expensive bottles (BPA free cute bug designs and all) but decided to save some money.  I love the vintage look of these and I'm so happy I bought them.  As a side benefit they are a perfect fit for my Medela [...] pump.  The one problem I have is that my son won't take the silicone nipple and I'm having a hard time finding a latex one that will fit the bottle.,4
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","The bottles are great, the nipples were not so much.  My son wouldn't drink using the nipples provided, but using other nipples solved that problem.  I felt very safe heating up his milk in this glass container.",4
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","i boiled the bottles before i used them and one broke.  otherwise, the others were fine.",4
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","I cringe at the idea that I fed my baby from heated up polycarbonate bottles. I might not be able to breastfeed my baby, but with my new glass bottles, at least I know that I am feeding her the purest form of formula I can possibly give. She hated the taste of the latex rubber nipples so I bought some silicone ones and was successful.When I consider the epidemic of autism in this country, I am dedicated to buying pure, organic baby products and avoiding using plastic products especially when heating in the microwave.",4
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","These bottles are wonderful...BPA free and my baby had no issues with the bottle. If you are breastfeeding, the slow nipple is not too slow, so I recommend just using the slow flow with breastfeeding.",5
Philips Avent 4oz Bottle w/ Newborn Nipple,"my son had no problems with the nipple or the shape of the bottle (holding it in his little hands). however, this bottle leaks and it's a nightmare to deal with.  as another reviewer wrote, you turn it too much and it leaks, you turn it too little and it leaks.i can't count the number of times the milk leaked from under the cap over his face, neck and clothing.  in the middle of the night,it's even more of a headache.  i wrote to avent about this problem and i'm sure they have received other complaints.  they should have recalled these bottles...if the product does not work in the way it's supposed to, ie. feed your child in a clean, effective, safe manner, then it should not be on the market for people to purchase.",1
Playtex Natural Action Nipple - Fast Flow - 2 pk,"I ordered these nipples because my children will not take any other and I was so excited to find them since they have become so hard to find!  I was willing to pay the outrageous price just to get them in hand.  I waited, anxiously for them to arrive, only to find an entirely different item in the box.  Instead of 2 squared off laytex fast flow nipples as pictured, I recieved 2 silicone rounded nipples.  I am angry not only for the false advertising, but also because I have to now send them back and pay a re-stocking fee to the company who sent them out!  Amazon - you let me down!!!!",1
Playtex Natural Action Nipple - Fast Flow - 2 pk,The item was OLD and the packaging was almost open.  How terrible it was to receive this.  The latex on the nipples was so old it was hard and completely unusable.  I struggled to get my baby to take a bottle and was desperate for help...receiving this and knowing I wasted my money was like a kick in the booty.,1
Playtex Natural Action Nipple - Fast Flow - 2 pk,This is my very first review - and I am only doing it because I AM COMPLETELY AMAZED. I exclusively breastfed all three of my children. The first I HAD to bottle train because I had to go back to work (the worst experience of my life). My second never took a bottle because it was to hard to make her take it.With my third (who is only now 4 months old) I tried to give her a bottle at least once a day. This worked until about 6 weeks when she just randomly stopped taking the bottle.After much research I decided to try this bottle. It just WORKED. no fuss - goes back and forth between this nipple and breast no problem.I would recommend this to anyone.,5
Playtex Natural Action Nipple - Fast Flow - 2 pk,couldnt find these kind of nipples anywhere around my town. these are what i was searching for. I only wish they came in all three flow stages!,5

Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"Nice soft pad, works great and absorbs a lot of liquid. Only problem is it does pill up, bad! I suggest you wash it alone and dry it alone the first time. Take a lint shaver and get the pills off, the next time wash and hang dry. That's what I did and I don't have anymore problems. Compared to the other ones on the market, this is the best one.",4
Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"I bought 2 of the these in case I have to wash one. I do  wash then almost every 2weeks  for over one year  and they still look good.  Love it, would recommend!",5
Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"I like this mattress pad cover b/c it's much easier to put on than the Evenflo one I have.  My Evenflo one you have to tug, pull, and stetch to get it on and even then it's not on perfect, a real pain.  It does &quot;pill&quot; a little after being washed, but it doesn't concern me, you put a sheet over it anyway.  My 5 month old daughter's diaper has leaked a couple of times overnight and the mattress stayed dry, that's all I need!",4
Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"My son used his ""Kid-Ding fitted mattress cover"" for over a year. It had gotten kind of gross so I decided to run quickly to the store to pick up a replacement. I made the mistake of not reading the details. This company Kid-Ding makes TWO different mattress covers that look almost identical if you don't read between the lines! About the same size, one is a Kid-Ding FLAT mattress cover and the other is a Kid-Ding FITTED mattress cover.I wasted my money cause I couldn't return it once I opened it and realized the one I got at the storeWaterproof Crib & Toddler Bed Pad - 27 x 50 - Whitedidn't have a fitted skirt to wrap around the mattress! I tried to make the best of that one, but it was AWFUL! Underneath the crib sheet, it slips and slides all over the place and crinkles up like crazy! What a disaster!I went online to make sure I get the correct one this time, and I did!!! This one is a fitted mattress cover by the same company and is just PERFECT! Wraps around the crib mattress flawlessly and doesn't move an inch! It stays put and makes slipping on the crib sheet so much easier!!! I have since bought another one! They're great and reversible. I machine wash mine and air dry -- DO NOT put it in the dryer!",5
Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"I've washed this pad three times now, following all of the recommended instructions.  It's already pilled and fraying at the edges of the skirt.  I have a flat pad from this same line which has been laundered the same number of times.  It looks as if I've had it a year -- and used it hard for a year, at that, which I haven't.Not only that, but WalMart sells this exact same item for four dollars less.  Talk about a gyp!  If I'm going to buy something cheap and poorly wearing (which wasn't my intent), I could have at least saved myself the shipping and four dollars.",1
Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"I have been washing and drying it (low heat) with no problems. It fits well. Just don't scrub really hard when you spot clean it, because I noticed a lot more &#34;wear and tear&#34; from that. Other than that, it's just what I was looking for.",5
Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"We bought this as a mattress protector but it is alsoquilted and adds comfort to my son's crib.  Works welland one thing I like about this protector is that it is fittedto the mattress, no snaps, no ties, just slip it on like you would a fitted sheet.  Dirty? Toss it in the washer.  Two thumbs up!",5
Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"I saw some people didn't think this washed well but it did fine when I washed it, if you follow the directions.",4
Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"I have been using the pad for several months now. It certainly does the job, but the reason I am giving it 4 stars and not 5, is that it seems to collect a lot of lint from the dryer. The pad looks dirty when it comes out, though it has just been washed and dried.Other than that, I am pretty happy with the overall performance. My 2-yr old constantly takes off her diaper and wets the bed; as a result, i have to wash it almost every day. So far, it keeps its shape and doesn't fall apart as opposed to the more expensive one I have used before.",4
Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"They don't hold up great in the wash, but it is no big deal since they are used under the sheet anyway.  They serve the purpose, but just get &quot;pilly&quot; after a couple washings.",4
"Sassy 2 Pack Baby Less Mess Toddler Spoon, Colors May Vary","This spoon is the only one I have found that has a curved handle, making it easy for my 18 month old to independently feed herself. She can't scoop as well with the gerber spoons like she can with the sassy spoon.",5
"Sassy 2 Pack Baby Less Mess Toddler Spoon, Colors May Vary",This spoon has really helped my toddler learn to feed himself. The food stays on the spoon better & it's easier for him to grip the handle.Highly recommend!,5
"Sassy 2 Pack Baby Less Mess Toddler Spoon, Colors May Vary",The handles are user friendly for your little one to grasp.The spoon is deep so it holds more and the holes make it less likely for the food to spill.  Remember not to use it for cereal and milk or other foods with thin gravies.,5
"Sassy 2 Pack Baby Less Mess Toddler Spoon, Colors May Vary","i just got these, and my daughter loves to feed herself...but i thought a fork comes with the spoon, not 2 spoons...all in all, its easy for her to use",4
"Sassy 2 Pack Baby Less Mess Toddler Spoon, Colors May Vary","These spoons were shorter than I had anticipated, but our 15 month-old, who has good-sized hands, has no problem using them.  The pair we received are green and orange.",5
"Sassy 2 Pack Baby Less Mess Toddler Spoon, Colors May Vary",I agree with another reviewer that amazon should either sell gender neutral spoons or sell the pink and blue separately.  The spoons I received are an annoyingly bright hot pink.  Buyer beware that you are probably going to get pink spoons.,3
"Sassy 2 Pack Baby Less Mess Toddler Spoon, Colors May Vary","I really like these spoons for two reasons:(1) Food doesn't fall off before it gets to child's mouth(2) Innovative design is safer for baby.  My 6 month old would rather play with and chew on the spoon that eat.  With the long, straight design spoons, I worry that he'll stab his throat or choke.  Not so with this spoon!",5
"Sassy 2 Pack Baby Less Mess Toddler Spoon, Colors May Vary","I don't like them that much. The handle has a strange shape that makeit impossible for my daughter to hold, plus it is too big for hermouth so she's just playing with it and not eating from it.Another thing is that in the picture you see 2 blue spoons and I got 2pink ones (I have a daughter so it was ok for me).I have to add that my baby eats preaty well with other spoons (gerber and the first years)",2
"Sassy 2 Pack Baby Less Mess Toddler Spoon, Colors May Vary",I love these spoons and won't use anything else.  I've tried so many toddler spoons that have let me down.  Unfortunatly these Sassy spoons aren't as easy to come by in stores.  The holes help keep runnier foods on longer and the handle is chunky and easy to grip for little hands.  I would highly recommend these spoons to anyone looking for toddler spoons!!!,5

"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",This is a good bottle nipple which of course fits the phillips avent bottles.  Even though this is a slow flow nipple my 3 month old baby did and still at 4 months does struggle with it on occasion for being too fast.  In our case there's also a little bit of nipple preference so I am not sure that it is entirely the nipple's fault (as in not being slow enough).  Perhaps in another month or two we'll revisit this review.,4
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack","My son is 10.5 months and was on the variable flow nipple from about 6-10 months old so we could add a little rice cereal for his ""reflux"" (which turned out to be food allergies). At about 9 months (with no rice cereal) he started collapsing the variable speed nips.  On a frustrated whim, I ordered the fast flow ones.  Although they were rated for 6 months, I had to try something.  They are GREAT!  He's used them for about 2 weeks and he no longer collapses the nips and eats at a better speed.  Wish I'd thought of trying this sooner!  (As a note: My only gripe is that we do have to line up the nipples properly or they leak. But I had done this with his size 1 and 2 nipples when he was smaller, so knew immediately how to correct this.  So, I am still rating these 5 stars because they are serving my purpose.)",5

"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack","Better than a big multi pack, but you always need more than one so you can use, rewash, and always be ready. Our local big box stores have been unexpectedly not keeping all styles and sizes in stock, so thank you Philips and Amazon!",5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",Order these for my newborn when the 2 hole nipple flowed too fast.  Product is just has expected - high quality.  Both my kids liked these nipples.,4
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",I see all the great reviews here and was so excited when I got these but they are terrible. I had to add baby oatmeal to my 2 month old's bottles due to severe reflux and he practically gagged with this nipple. The ""slowest"" flow is way too fast.,1
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",Looks great in the package and hoping my daughter will love it! My son loved these nipples so we are hoping our daughter is the same.,5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack","I moved up from newborn flow to this next size at 3 months old and he's here to stay! He's now 7 months and he won't take any other flow size, which I've tried several other at different times. I've purchased this slow flow avent nipple three times now, I'm happy if my baby is. As far as the product itself, we use each nipple two to three times daily and it lasts a good three month, just like the packaging recommends to change it.",5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",my child seems to like these i have no problem with them except they seem a lil hard and large also the seal on the bottle has started to get leak.,4
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack","This is a great item. Quick shipping. Good quality, very ease to use, clean, the price is ok while comparing to others and it last long time if care it correctly",5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack","Since using these nipples my daughter has had considerably less colic. They are strudy and long lasting and you can purchase them in different stages so that the nipples never get old because before they are worn out its time to change them. These are also a lot thicker than normal nipples, they are of a higher quality but they only fit avent bottles.",5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack","After trying a few bottles, I went to avent and never went back. The nipples are great. I used them with both my sons.",5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack","These are very durable nipples. They've withstood numerous washings/sterilizing and they maintained their appearance and function. The Slow flow is a good flow for babies that are both bottle fed and breast fed. These nipples fit the original Avent bottles not the newer Avent Natural Flow bottles. These were good for a few weeks until we inadvertently bought the new Avent Natural Flow bottles. Since we were stuck with our purchase, we tried it and now our baby wouldn't go back to these.",4
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",These are cheaper on Amazon than going to Walmart and buying.  Great nipples for Avent bottles.  My newborns to two month olds always used the Slow Flow vs the newborn flow.,5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",We were looking to replace our worn out nipples and these were the exact same ones that came with the original bottles!,5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack","slow = 0 mo, medium = 6 mo and fast = 9 momakes me wonder where 3 mo fits in",4
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",Avent always make excellent products. Works as expected. No reflux or colic. My baby is very happy My baby used to make a fuss and it was because the other nipples were slow flow. This are for babies 3 to 5 months.,5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",Our baby seems to really like the Avent products; have tried other brands that we had received at our baby shower and they didn't work out.  These nipples are no exception.  Feedings go a bit faster now.  I love the interchangeability of Avent bottles/accessories.,5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack","The Avent nipples are great, but I just wish that the description was clearer that the slow flow nipples are actually level 2 nipples and not level 1.  Luckily I will be able to use these later on, but I was hoping to get a slow flow version of the level 1 nipples.  I'm guessing there is no such thing.",3
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack","Tried finding these in the stores, but no one seemed to have them in stock. Found them here, and couldn't be happier. Thanks!",5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",i went on the avent site and this product does not show up as bpa free.  can anyone confirm this?  the ad is misleading to say bpa free.,4
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",We were looking for a bottle nipple that would not stress our baby's gums when sucking and this has good flow. Overall I am happy to find a BPA free product that I know will not cause my litle one harm.,4
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",It's a good price for what you get. Highly recommend the newborn flow for breastfeeding mothers irregardless of the age of their baby. I have twin 11 month olds and was using a size 2 nipple before getting the newborn flow and it's been much better- easier transition from bottle to breast.,5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",Everywhere else sales these for almost $10 each!The newborn (one hole) size is perfect for breastfeeding babies. Love this brand!,5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",Excellent and good product I recommend it. I like me very much. Perfect. Excellent and good product I recommend it. I like me very much. Perfect,5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",MY LITTLE BABY LOVES THIS NIPPLES....I EXPEND TWO MONTHS BUYING DIFFERENT KIND OF NIPPLES AND BOTTLES AND FINALLY!!I FOUND THE PERFECT BOTTLE AND PERFECT NIPPLE,5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",My son soesn't like the variable nipple so I tried this one. He takes the bottle very well. Only problem is that it's hard to find at stores. So buy extras when found.,5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",These #1 nipples are very slow!  All 9 oz. bottles come with #2 and too fast for a newborn.  I'm mixing #2 and #1 at week 4 and baby is adapting well.Just get some #1 and you should be set being able to poke holes to get to #3 and #4.,4
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack","At the tip of the nipple are the 1,2,3,or 4 holes and there is a circle around them.  This circle pops out when there is too much pressure applied while washing.  Now I am assuming it is ripping out while I wash them (I use a bottle brush and apply pressure on the inside of the nipple pushing a lot of soapy water through the little holes).  However, what's interesting is that this has only happened to the #4 nipples.  You would think it would have happened to the other ones too since they have even fewer holes.I am assuming the tip is popping out while I wash because it would kill me to think it is ripping out while the baby is sucking on it and she could choke on it.  It has now happened to 6 nipples!!!  And the first 3 I didn't discover until after she was drinking from them and had a geyser of formula being fed to her.I should add that when I went to buy a replacement packet of #4 nipples (there are 2 in a packet), inside the packet they were actually both #1 nipples and the tips were BOTH slashed cut (not ripped, but cut with a blade).  I called Avent.  They sent me one replacement nipple and an envelope for me to send them the damaged nipples back.  I'm debating if I should send them the 6 other nipples with the torn out tips.And have you notice how the bottles always leak. I found this dad's blog with instructions and pictures to make sure they don't leak, and it works.[...]If my assumption is correct that the tips are coming out while being washed (and not while the baby is sucking on them), then I suppose if you are careful while washing, the nipples are good.",1
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack","I am the mother of a four month old daughter and a four year old son. I am using the Avent bottles and nipples to feed my daughter expressed breast milk when I cannot be there to nurse her. The slower flow of the newborn nipples is as close to breastfeeding as one can get with a bottle, according to my lactation consultant. My daughter has no problem switching back and forth, which makes my husband's life a lot easier when it comes time to feed her! Both the bottles and the nipples are bigger and easier to wash. We have been very pleased.",5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",The slow flow are recommended for breast fed babies since the flow is similar to breast.  My baby sucks the milk out of bottle way too fast with these nipples.  4 ounces gone in under two minutes.  Not sure if the nipple should be slower or if my baby has a super strong suck and is a voracious eater.  Too bad there isn't a way to slow her down other than taking the bottle out of her mouth.,3
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack","bought these to feed my son  mixed with rice cereal, flow to fast, and have not used them much at all.",3
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack","I went back to work only 6 weeks after the birth of my daughter and I believe the unique shape and anti collapse design of this nipple kept her from beconing confused and preferring a bottle.For moms who nurse, I would not recomend more than the two hole slow flow nipples, even with an older baby.  The slow flow rate makes them realize that the faster easier way to get milk is from natures source, your breast!  Even with the one hole flow rate, my daughter finishes off a bottle in 10 minutes flat, I don't worry that she needs a faster flow.If you feel that your older breast fed baby needs a faster flow, instead of going up a nipple flow, why not start him on the Avent magic cup?  The unique design lets babies as young as 3 months drink form a cup.  And the Magic Valve sippies fit all Avent bottles, so it's cost effective.",5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack","On the slowest flow my 5 month old ends up wearing more than he drinks! This is maddening when its breast milk. I had first tried it out at 3 months and just thought my baby was not ready for it, but by 5 months I know its not my baby, its the nipple.",1
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",It's a replacement pack of nipples for avent bottles.  Not much else to say.  Nipples worked fine and swapped in just as expected.,5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",My little one would use nothing else he is now two and continues to use these nipple. Even thou they have been cut for larger openings. They have past the test of time and so a 5 star rating is in order.,5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",I have used Avent nipples for all 3 of my kids.  They are a great product at a great price on Amazon especially if you can get the free shipping!,5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",At just over 7 months I add rice cereal (and even slip a little pureed baby food) in my baby's bottle.  These nipples allow for smooth suction with no collapses and baby is happy!!  Baby controls flow and is fully satisfied after drinking.  WONDERFUL PRODUCT!!!,5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",Exactly what I needed. I am very happy with the product. I will be ordering them again in the future.,5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack","When my 2month little boy started on rice in his bottle I must have gone through 15 playtex nipples just trying to get the hole cut not to big not to small I had enough. I went to the avent web site and it was advertising a thicker flow nipple, so I changed bottles, and got these nipples. They saved me money, (not only on nipples but on liner)but most important no more upset stomics from eating too fast for my little one.",5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack","This are a little harder consistency than the size 3 nipples, which is good because now my 6th month old daughter is sucking too hard on the size 3 nipples and they are caving in. Perfect for 6 month olds!",5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",Perfect for juices and nestum. The variable flow really works. I use it with my first daughter and with my little ones too.,5
Playtex Baby Drop-Ins Orthodontic Latex Nipple: Medium Flow - 2 Pack,"these are the only nipples my baby will take, besides mommy's.  They are very hard to find.. and I don't know why since it seems I am not the only mommy who is looking for them.  I wish Amazon would offer them with free shipping !!!!!*hint* *hint*",5
Playtex Baby Drop-Ins Orthodontic Latex Nipple: Medium Flow - 2 Pack,"I was so excited when I got these in the mail, because my daughter hasn't been happy with a single nipple yet. I thought these would do the trick, but she cannot latch onto them properly. She is exclusively bottlefed, so she doesn't open her mouth up very wide like a breastfed baby would. I give these nipples a 1 star because they are just plain NASTY! I don't know what they made these out of, or what they put on them, but they smell terrible! Like..chicken bouillon or something..pretty gross. I probably wouldn't use these even if my baby liked them, just because of how bad they stink.",1
Playtex Baby Drop-Ins Orthodontic Latex Nipple: Medium Flow - 2 Pack,"Finding the right Playtex nipples has been like a Goldilocks and the Three Bears experience for me. The latex Playtex slow flow NaturaLatch nipples that we got with our bottles were way too fast. My nearly 3 month old baby chokes because the milk flows so fast. When super hungry he can chug a 4 1/2 oz bottle in 5 minutes with the slow flow latex version. So I tried these silicone NaturaLatch slow flows and they are way too slow. My baby gets frustrated with how slow these nipples flow. It took him up to an hour sometimes to finish a 4 1/2 oz bottle! There needs to be some middle ground. Since these slow flow silicone nipples were too slow, I tried the medium flow version and it was way too fast.Strangely enough I found that the Playtex Orthodontic Latex medium flow is the perfect flow speed, but the flat shape of the nipple ""neck""/base makes it difficult to funnel the last of the milk into the nipple.  The flat nipple makes it difficult for my baby to get those last drops even if I could funnel the last of the milk into it.  Ultimately, there's always wasted milk with this nipple. Playtex needs to work on improving their nipple flows.",3
Playtex VentAire Bottle 9 oz. - 1 pk.,"I have tried the Ventaire bottles originally because I received them as a shower gift.  When I registered I shyed away from them because I thought that $4 was a lot of money for one bottle.  But, let me tell all of you looking to purchase the best bottle for your baby...Ventaire.  My son will eat will almost any nipple or bottle, but he gets really gassy, which leads to fussiness.  But, not with Ventaire.  He eats quickly, clamly, and gas-free.  Ventaire is the best bottle on the market.",5
Dr. Browns 8oz. Natural Flow Standard Baby Bottle,"Just wanted to inform all parents out there that this product contains BPA/ Bisphenol A.  I returned mine.  Pacifiers,bottles,breast pumps can have BPA in them as well such as the AVENT products that I returned.  I then decided to go with Born Free bottles and sterilizer,Soothie pacifier and the Gerber Nuk pacifiers,and Medela pump.  All their products are BPA Free.  You do the research and decide if you will buy or continue to use their products.  I've already written the President, my senators, and Oprah.  Hopefully together we can keep our children safe.",1
Dr. Browns 8oz. Natural Flow Standard Baby Bottle,"I am a first time mother.  My daughter has severe reflux.  I did not sleep a wink the first month she was here. Day in &amp; day out I would ask for the strenght to make it through another day. I accidentally ran across this bottle and thought I would give it a shot.  I would have tried anything at this point.  God answered my prayers, because this bottle is THE BEST. She still has reflux, but not near as bad as she did.  She is much happier.",5
Dr. Browns 8oz. Natural Flow Standard Baby Bottle,"This bottle is great for collicy babies or those with acid-reflux.  Ever since we started my daughter on these bottles, (which by the way, she suffered from both acid-reflux and colic)she has been a happier child.  No more fussiness in the evenings, and a lot less spit up!  This product does what it claims!  The only downer...which is a big deal to me...is that the bottles leak.  The caps that can be placed under the ring to prevent leakage on most bottles, do not work in this case.  The leaking actually occures below the cap, opposed to the nipple.  It's a pain.  I have to put all her bottles in zip-lock bags before putting them in her bottle bag.  But it's worth it to me. The good out ways the bad.",4
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 8-Ounce",I ordered this pad to try it out and very happy with it. I am ordering another one right now. Highly recommended. Very soft. Great product.,5
Playtex VentAire Bottle 6 oz. - 1 pk.,"I only purchased a few of these bottles at first because of the price, but WOW they really work they way they were designed to.I will not go another night without using these bottles.  I used to be up hours with a belly-aching baby until now.Less gas, spitups, and feeds better than ever before.",5
Furniture Wall Straps (Set of 2),"My husband installed these on every piece of furniture that could tip in our house. It took him about an afternoon, but we have a lot of furniture. They are easy enough to unhook when you need to move something, but they hold well. Cheaper than I could find anywhere else.",5
Furniture Wall Straps (Set of 2),"Sold in pairs, you should use both on a single piece of furniture.  Comes with all necessary hardware, including screws.  Once installed, you can't really tell they are there.  However, it takes a little bit of space to get your hand behind the furniture to tighten the straps on install, so it's difficult to get them fully tightened.  In other words, with furtniture pressed up against the wall, you (or your kids) will still be able to tilt or lean the furniture, but only a couple of inches -- it shouldn't tip over.  Overall, a good product that is reasonably easy to install.Amazing to me that such a necessary product is so hard to find locally -- thank goodness for Amazon!",4
Furniture Wall Straps (Set of 2),easy to install and set up. tested it a few times and worked really well at keeping the furniture from falling over.,5
Furniture Wall Straps (Set of 2),These straps work great. They were easy to install and very inexpensive.  I highly recommend all parents use them at home.,5
Furniture Wall Straps (Set of 2),Works as advertised. Shipped on time.,4
Furniture Wall Straps (Set of 2),"Excellent product and easy to install. You will need 2-3 straps for most large furniture. Well worth the peace of mind. Directions are well written. You will need a drill, screwdriver and stud finder. Amazon was much cheaper than Babies R Us when I purchased mine, and the shipping was free. Thanks!",5
Furniture Wall Straps (Set of 2),Hardest part was finding the wall stud - straps installed easily and are adjustable. We used it to attach a 6' bookcase in our toddler's room. Would definietely recommend these.,5
Furniture Wall Straps (Set of 2),I had my dad install these. They work great. I feel confident that they would buy me time to run across the room if my son decided to crawl on the book case.,5
Furniture Wall Straps (Set of 2),"It took about an hour for me to install this - mostly because I was trying to keep my son from eating the screws. If he wasn't there, it would probably be about a 20 minute install. My only 'complaint' is that I had to use other screws than what it came with. This isn't really a 'complaint' for me, but I figured it could be for other people. Very satisfied with the durability and strength of this product. I am feeling much better about our dressers now.",4
Furniture Wall Straps (Set of 2),"I bought these with the expectation of using them on my book cases but to mount them correctly you have to move the object to get behind them to mount to the wall and the back of the bookcase.  This required unloading them to the point they're light enough to move, attaching the brackets to the wall stud and the back of the book cases, trying to cinch the strap as tight as possible and putting everything back.  This took about an hour.  Since I have 20 book cases, this is a lot of time.  A much simpler and cheaper alternative is to buy 'L' brackets from a hardware store and screw it to the top of the book case and the wall stud.  Total  time 10 minutes. No unloading or moving the book cases.  Mine are tall enough you can't even see the 'L' brackets.  If you have some short object needing mounted where the 'L' bracket would be visible, these would be perfect.",2
Furniture Wall Straps (Set of 2),"These straps come with easy to follow instructions.  They are durable, relatively discrete (white is a good color choice), and they give use the peace of mind that our toddler cannot tip the furniture.  We'll be buying more.",5
Furniture Wall Straps (Set of 2),Now I a can leave my childs room without being scared that big desk going to tip over on them. I never had these growing up but I have had heard horror stories about dressers falling on kids. It is only couple bucks well worth it.,5
Furniture Wall Straps (Set of 2),"These were easy to install and I don't see how a piece of furniture with two of these could fall over - without taking the wall studs with it. I especially liked that the furniture half and the wall half come apart for installation, makes life much easier. I didn't need to predrill either (I know you're supposed to, but most of us don't).",5
Furniture Wall Straps (Set of 2),Be aware when purchasing that the photo shows 8 but there are really 8 pairs if you order that selection.That's twice what we needed but they are super sturdy and the hardware is excellent.I'm only dinging it because of the misleading photo.,4
Furniture Wall Straps (Set of 2),I have a very curious 2 year old and I was worried a heavy 6ft cabnet would topple over onto her...put the straps in and I am a little more at ease!  Easy to install - just cinch it tight when both ends are secure!,5
Furniture Wall Straps (Set of 2),"I would never rely on straps like this as a substitute for good supervision, but it does give me some extra peace of mind.  These straps are more than adequate to hold up my bookcases and dressers.  Installation is straightforward.The only downside is that you may not want these for nice, expensive furniture.  You do have to drill some holes in the backside, which may bother some people.",5
KidCo Center Gateway - White,Bought this to keep the dogs out.  It is easy to install with no damage to walls or casing. Easy open and walk through ended up getting another.,5
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"We have owned the gate for just a few months, but so far it has been everything we had hoped for.  It is attractive enough to use in-between two formal rooms, it opens effectively and easily with one hand, and, most importantly, it keeps the pets where we want them to stay.  All in all, I'm very pleased with this product.",4
KidCo Center Gateway - White,We have a new crawler in the house and she's been curious about the stairs lately. I had intended to order a replacement for our bottom of the stairs gate since we put the old one across our four-year-old's bedroom entry (to keep the baby away from the Legos). This gate appeared to be the same but it is now a little trickier to open. There is a button on both sides of the handle and both must be pressed at the same time in order for the handle to lift (and the gate to open). Our son is having a hard time getting both buttons. Hopefully it will come with some practice--the poor kid has to ask for help to go upstairs for now. I'm not a fan of this improvement.,3
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"I purchased this gate for our church nursery. So far it is working out very well. We have had other plastic gates that worked fine but were broken off the wall by kids hanging and swinging on it. The KidCo metal gate opens from the center so we are hoping it will hold up much longer and not be an enticement to kids swinging on the open gate door. The only negative for me is the tripping hazard of the bar across the bottom of the gate or threshold. I have seen other gates that have a threshold more like one in a home. This bar on the threshold takes some getting used to and could be a hazard for someone who is not aware of it's height. The childproof locking feature is a plus! If it lasts longer than our last two gates I would give it a 5 star rating but since we only have it a month, I gave it 4 stars.",4
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"I bought this gate with two extension kits to use in a wide space. The extension kits break into small pieces. The first day I had it up it fell on my foot and broke into several pieces, we put it back up, when my baby stood up and held onto it the gate again broke into several pieces and fell on top of him. I returned it the next day.",1
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"Easy to install, sturdy gate providing excellent security.  However the opening mechanism is EXTREMELY unuserfriendly!  You have to push a button (which is only on 1 side), pull up the handle, then pull up and hold the middle of the gate door and swing open.  I can only assume the pulling up part is a sort of secondary safety to keep the gate closed even though the handle is not engaged.  Guests and babysitter have a HECK of a time figuring out how to open the gate.  One of my late arriving family members ""forced"" it open (didn't do the pull up and hold) and it came crashing down in my hardwood hallwall at 4am .... it was NOT appreciated.",2
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"I purchased this gate after buying a different walk through gate.Regalo Easy Open Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - WhiteI had to sell that one because the only way to have it be secure is to screw cups into the doorway. Otherwise it's loose enough for my 24 lb dog to push over.I wish I'd just bought this one in the first place! Sometimes you really do get what you pay for and this is one of those times. Yes, the Regalo gate is 1/2 the price, but totally unsafe.The KidCo gate is amazing. Super easy to install. VERY sturdy. This one isn't moving! Plus it has the bonus of the opening that you walk through being a lot wider than the Regalo one. Plus there is nothing poking out of the opening to catch on your clothes as with the Regalo. It is easy to open and swings either way, which is handy. It's nice and heavy and looks very nice. The dogs are confined, but I can get through with a load of laundry without pulling down a gate or risking life and limb by climbing over one.All in all I highly recommend this gate. It's a great height, easy for the cats to jump over, but high enough to keep the dogs in. Great gate and worth the extra money.",5
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"We purchased this gate originally for the bottom of our stairs. We really only considered pressure mounted gates as we didn't want to put holes in the walls of our brand new house! We also wanted a gate with a doorway, so we didn't have to constantly climb over it as we were heading up the stairs. After some research, we ended up deciding to give this one a try.The gate took a little time to install properly, and it did require that we purchase an extension kit as well. You do need to install this gate with a lot of pressure, to the point where I thought it was starting to dent the drywall a bit. However, once the gate was installed there has been no issues with it whatsoever. Installed properly, the gate doesn't move at all, and the door is not able to be opened without using the latch. Our son has been able to latch the gate himself for quite a while, but never able to unlatch it.Just a note that we actually had to installed the gate on the first stair (at the bottom of the stairs there is only a wall on one side) and it has not been any problems installed on the actual stair.The gate has worked out so well we just got a second one to use in the upstairs hallway to keep our son away from the top of the stairs as well.",5
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"This gate looks great.  And works great.  It goes with our white woodwork, and that's what we wanted.  We had been looking at wood gates, but this one goes beautifully with our house.  You can't tell if it's metal or wood.  Now, I need to add that the top part of the gate doesn't latch accurately, but it doesn't effect the gate closing securely and opening easily, surprisingly!  And because it doesn't effect the opening and closing I decided to give it 5 starts anyway. It's tall enough for us to not have to bend over to open and close the gate.  And our dogs stay right where they are supposed to stay.  And, best of all, you don't need hardware to screw in the wall.  (We are not using it for children, just dogs.)  I'm getting 2 more for my sister's summer house.  Oh, the door opens wide enough for all of us to get through easily. And it is not very expensive, either.  We have bought other wood gates (less money) but they never worked.  You won't be disappointed.  (I've never written a review before!)",5
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"This was simple to put together, opens/swings easily and adjusts (with extension kits) to almost any opening.I have not tested it for toddlers or on stairs; I use it as a dog gate.",5
KidCo Center Gateway - White,I bought two of these gates to keep my labrador dog in a hallway when I am away. It was a great buy. It is very easy to install (pressure mount) and looks good. I also like the fact the opening of the gate (22 inch) is quite big.,5
KidCo Center Gateway - White,So this gate's latch is slightly annoying but it did the job and kept my child off the stairs. Like this product and would purchase again.,5
KidCo Center Gateway - White,Needed a gate for a new puppy.  This gate is very easy to install.  Pressure sensitive pads avoid any drilling requirements.  Gate feature is excellent.  Check opening width requirements to determine if you need any extensions.,5
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"Incredibly easy to assemble. This looks great and fits our door well. We use it to separate our cats and dog, but I'm sure it works well for kids, too :)",5
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"I purchased this gate to put in our hallway to keep my doggy corralled. It was easy to install, it looks great, and it is easy to use. I did have to purchase an extension as well. This gate replaces an old one that did not have a walk-through mechanism. I appreciate the walkthrough because the old gate was hard to hop over (I'm short), and I had to take the old one down when my daddy came to visit because he has a bad hip and was also unable to continually ""hop"". My dog seems to like the new gate. He is always alert and likes to watch what is going on down the hallway, and with this gate he has a better view. Also, the bars are spaced tightly enough that I don't worry about his head getting stuck in the bars. He is a Pomeranian/schipperke mix, so I searched extensively before purchasing this gate to be sure the bars were not far enough apart for him to get stuck. This gate looks nice and is not gaudy like some of the plastic ones I have seen. It appears to be sturdy as well.",5
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"We purchased 2 of these gates and are very happy with them.  It took a little longer to install then the instructions suggested, but it was well worth it.  If you follow the directions you should have no problem installing them.  The gates swings open both ways in or out, and the area you step through is quite large, wider then we thought it would be.  We are delighted with these gates and highly recommend them.",5
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"I tried few other gates before, none worked for long as this one did. I have this gate for the past 2 years and it is sturdy and work great. without screws to attach to the wall, it stays put. good as a child gate and pet gate (I use it for both purposes).",5
KidCo Center Gateway - White,This gate works well for the area I needed it. I would prefer it did not have the extra lifting step to open it.,5
KidCo Center Gateway - White,I have a fence and a wall where the gate was installed and it took me quite a long time to get this gate well installed. This is the second brand I have and the best so far but I haven't really found something I could easily install.,3
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"We needed something to keep our Boston Terrier off our expensive leather furniture in the living room, so I got this after shopping around reading various reviews. I was not disappointed. When you install this gate properly, it is extremely sturdy and feels like it could hold up to quite alot of abuse from a large dog or child without budging an inch. I highly recommend you install it in a doorway so the pressure mount will be against solid wood or something of the sort. If you set this up on drywall without knowing where a stud is, you'll probably damage your walls.The one catch is the instructions are very oddly arranged, with the directions in multiple languages in one part, and the corresponding diagrams in a totally different section, so you end up flipping back and forth trying to comprehend it all. Despite that, the directions are actually pretty sound and rather well written, it just takes a little time to comprehend. Don't let the this discourage you though, the effort is well worth it. It also comes with 2 extensions in the box, which came in handy for me. The walk-thru opening is wide enough for a large adult to walk through without a problem, we've actually even had moving men walk through it while carring a king-size mattress with no problem. The bar at the bottom that you have to step over is pretty low and out of the way, we've never had anyone trip on it. The the handle and locking mechanism is a little tricky and took a few tries to understand, but once you do, you can open it with ease.All in all, I think this gate is fantastic and I highly recommend it.",5
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"I'm using the gate to keep pets in a specific room, while at the same time keeping a door open allow circulation throughout the house.",5
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"This baby gate looks like it'd be a good bargain, but the install is much harder than it looks. I am very good at installing things and building things, but I found the instructions almost completely useless and unreadable. I  finally got it installed, but it was definitely tricky! Once it is installed it seems to be okay, but is all the trouble really worth it? I would argue, not. Also, beware of the gate which actually won't latch until you have pressure on it. I swings every which way and can knock into your ribs, head, or fingers. Be cautious of this buy if you are at all easily frustrated with building/installing things for your home!",2
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"This is a nice solid gate. Like few other reviews had stated, the latching mechanism is a little difficult using one hand.  It took me couple days to learn to operate it using one hand, but it is possible.  It is much more solid and nicer than our friend's gate of a different brand.  I especially like the wider opening.  The door stays in wide open position when swung back.  This is nice that we can leave it open after the baby is asleep.Installation seems simple, although I must disclose that we didn't do it ourselves but hired couple guys to install it.  It took them less than 30 minutes to put it together.The only negative thing is the price.  I have no idea why something like this should cost more than $70.  We paid for it anyway because cheaper gates have small openings and we know that it will be annoying after a while.  However, it seems like a minor design difference and should not command 50%-100% more in price.",4
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"This is a great gate.  It is easy to install and it looks really nice.  The gate comes with one extension on each side of it(they must be added on each side.  You can't put both on the same side.)  The gate is very sturdy.  We like that it is a multi-step opening system.  You have to press in the button, lift the handle, and lift the gate in order to open the gate.  We are very satisfied with this gate and would recommend buying it.",5
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"We bought this gate to use with our 13 month old and were very excited not have to install hardware to the wall.  It was up for about 24 hours when I heard the baby cring that cry that you know they are in pain.  I found her at the gate, both knees were wedged between the vertical poles.  I managed to get one knee out but had to put vegtable oil on the other one to free it.  She of course was screaming the whole time and her knees were bruised.  Very nice design but I bought it for safety and that's not what I got.  The company said they just shortened the space between the rails, but I think it's too close now seeing how her knees got stuck.  Good luck to anyone trying to keep little ones out of harms way.  That's a job in itself.",2
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"I purchased this product used.  It was still easy to install and it is truly pressure mounted - we did not need to put holes in our walls.  We installed this at the bottom of our stairs, one step up.Pros:*This is a very sturdy gate.  My twins stand on the first step and constantly play and apply their weight.*Its fairly simple to use one handed.*The opening is plenty wide enough to walk through without having to turn sideways (and I'm not a skinny minnie)*This will probably work if I need to install in a doorway to keep toddlers in their room, and not conflict with a doorknob (just guessing).*The door can open either direction (although on the stairs that doesn't matter)Cons:I've been using this gate for at least 4 months now - I can't think of any.I bought another brand gate (a tall gate) to use in another entrance.  It is getting returned because 1.) its not truly pressure mounted, and 2.) its not sturdy like this kidco gate - I'm spoiled!  I mention this because I will go back and get another Kidco gate - I feel more comfortable knowing that it will hold up to two toddlers hanging on to it and I don't have to mar my walls.I recommend this gate and would purchase it again (even new).(I don't use this for pets, but this would be good for smaller animals or those not jumping due to the height of the gate)",5
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"After reading the negative reviews, there seem to be three camps of people who don't like the product.One group has uber-intelligent children, who figure out how to depress the button and lift up on the latch simultaneously, thereby allowing the child to escape. Tragically, while these children are mechanically inclined, they are not intelligent enough to resist the urge to pursue dangerous escapes.The second group is too unintelligent or impatient (as adults) to handle the exact same latching mechanism, or to step over a small bar. Hence they break the handle, and trip over the small lower anchor bar. This is tragic for both the parents and the children for so many reasons.The third group is deceived by the admittedly ambiguous instructions. You need to have this gate in a door frame or spanning between against two strong vertical surfaces. Then you need to crank the heck out of the compression ""bolts""  to ensure a very high degree of pressure. If you try to put it up against drywall, you will poke through the drywall. If you do not make the gate VERY tightly lodged, it will fall over, probably on your child as they try to climb on it.So, there are some legitimate problems with the gate. But, installed correctly and in a house of moderate intelligence on both the adult and child front, it should be just fine.I am of moderate intelligence, as are my offspring, and we have managed to make it work in three separate houses with only minor annoyance.YMMV.Update: Customer service was very responsive and nice when I needed to get a few replacement parts that got lost in a recent move.",4
KidCo Center Gateway - White,Easy to install and easy to use. It took my six year old a few tries to figure it out-because of the button.But she eventually got it down pat!,5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I have been looking for something like this for a while. Anything even close was double the cost. The hands free feature is a bonus.This is really made to last, it's solidly made. However, it is a little stiffer and I have to really push down on it to open the gate. Great if you have a toddler that is industrious enough to figure out how it works. My use is for keeping my dogs speparated from other parts of the house. Good deal",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We have used this gate for almost three years. We've used it in five different houses. We have three of the 5-inch extenders, and we've used the gate with all three and with just one. In all configurations, it's been terrific. The foot pedal requires quite a bit of weight to open. A toddler is not going to get it open. My 7-year-old niece and nephew were not heavy enough to open it, for instance, even when they stood on the pedal. After three years of heavy use, this gate is still solid as a rock. I love this product. It made my life as a parent easier because I knew it was strong, reliable, and safe. And outstanding piece of equipment, and *extremely* affordable (I got the gate and three extensions all for under a hundred bucks). First Years gets a gold star for this one!",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I tried a few different pressure-mounted gates before finding this one, and this one is far and away the best. I've had it for 6 years now and used it through both my kids' toddler years, and it still works just as well as the day I bought it.The ability to open and close the gate without using my hands is indispensable. And, unlike many of the cheaper pressure-mounted gates, this one doesn't move no matter how hard my screaming 3-year-old pushes or pulls. And you have to put real pressure on the pedal to get the thing open - my 3-year-old puts all his weight on it and still can't get it open, but my 6-year-old can open it if she pushes really hard, which is great because the older one can let the younger one in or out if need be.Like any gate, the installation is a bit difficult the first time, but they include a little plastic wrench, which is the only tool you need. And once you've done it once, it's no big deal to remove and install somewhere else if you want to. My parents bought this same gate so they can install it whenever I bring my kids over and remove it when we leave, and they like it as much as we do. It swings in and out, and you can orient it with the step on either side of the doorway depending on what's convenient for you, so it's very versatile.Bottom line: it's extremely durable, it's easy to use, and it's worth every penny.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I have three of these gates in my house and they are wonderful. They are sturdy, so even when my 15 month old shakes the gate, it doesn't move.  We recently had a party and everyone was raving about the gates.  My nieces and nephews who are older were also kept out of harms way with this gate.  Even though they knew to push down on the pedal, they couldn't get enough force to open it.The only draw back is the price. It's deceiving, because the gate it fairly narrow. We had to buy extensions for all three of our gates.  However, it is well worth the price.The best part is being able to get through the gates with your arms full.  I highly recommend this gate.!!!!",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,works well for containing over zealous foddlers and puppies. the step peddle is wonderful when your hands are full. easy to use and install. Would be a 5 if the gate was another 5"" higher.,4
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I was so excited about getting these gates so my older boys didn't have to climb over the typical tension gate and risk getting hurt when the darn thing tipped over.  Much to my disappointment, I could not close the bedroom door with the gate installed.  The foot lever gets in the way.  If I was going to use it in a doorway that didn't have a door, I probably would have given it five stars!  I hope to find a gate that will fit before one of my boys gets hurt!",3
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"Just got this for the nursery door.  I had it installed in about 15 minutes, and it is very sturdy and operates perfectly.  Although right now it is a dog gate to keep the dogs out, and my baby is not even crawling yet, I believe that it will last and function as intended (parents can easily operate, but baby can't).  I like the metal construction for the durability, and it is very attractive.  I even find it easy to use in the middle of the night when I am half-asleep!  I will probably get more for other rooms.  I wish my hallway at the stairs were narrower so this would fit there as well.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We have this mounted on the top of our stair case and it works perfect.  We've had it for 6months and no complaints.  I really like how it's hands free, it helps when you have to carry an armful.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This is a great gate.  It's just a bit noisy when the pedal is stepped on in order to open.  However, it has worked wonders in keeping my cats out of my children's rooms, as I do not want them sleeping in their cribs.",4
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I used this gate at a family member's house, and I loved it, so I bought one for our place. However, it is too small for our normal, standard width hallway. I have to buy the extension for it. It's a great gate, but I think it should be a little wider. I was REALLY looking forward to putting it up and containing my crazy toddler, but now I have to wait on the mail man to bring the extension kit.",4
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"really like this gate, love the foot pedal, the problem I have is that there are 7 photographs of the gate, 5 of which show a ramp at the bottom bar to prevent tripping. 2, 5, 6, 7, 8. While photos 6,7,8 look like customer provided photos, #2 is definately a manufacture provided photograph. the gate arrived today and it does not have the bottom plastic ramp that my other first years foot pedal gates have. . .  Really stinks that they don't say that they have stopped shipping the bottom trip ramp.",1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"Excellent Gate, Extremely sturdy. My 20 month son, bangs the Gate litrerary and the gate doesn't even move slightly from its position. This gate has withstand all the roughest usage by people and its still the same as new. We've been using since about a year now and have no complaint for it.A good buy and worth the money spend.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,This gate works exactly as advertised and we have been very pleased with it.  It's simple to use and install and keeps our daughter safe.  Highly recommended.,5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This is the third gate we have purchased--- And the best at that.  It is easy to install, and easy to add an extension, is sturdy, and simple as pie to open and close.I recommend this gate to anyone who thinks that there current gate has flaws.  Because, this one has absolutely no flaws.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"These baby gates are awesome. They are pretty easy to install and if anything happens, in our case a peddle bent, you contact the manufacturer. They quickly reply and send a replacement. Sadly one of the spots we placed a gate was still too wide even with a set of extenders but we improvised with a couple of two by fours. I am happy to have bought these (we bought three & two sets of extenders.)",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,This is a great product for a household with small children or pets that need boundaries. It's ""no hands"" feature really works!,5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We love this gate, which we've been using for over a year at the top of our stairs.  We have uneven walls in this space (smaller space at bottom of gate) due to large base molding, and this gate is a perfect solution. The foot pedal is easy to use, even while carrying a wiggling baby, and the gate is secure.  We had to add one extension.  I only wish the gate was available in wider widths - it would be great for our front porch.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,The gate is perfect for keeping my two puppies in the pantry.,5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,I use this gate as a dog gate and it fulfills all my expectations and work well to keep dogs out of the kitchen. It was very simple to install and works well.,4
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"Excellent quality, sturdy construction. When hands are full, step on gate opener and use your knee to open, great option when carrying my grandson into his bedroom. Shop around for prices tho, as I've seen up to $10-15 variance from diferent outlets",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I did not give this gate a 5 star, I think it is a great gate but my 18 month old could open it. Very disappointed, I still think first year gates are the best.",4
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"Purchased gate to keep doggie out of the living room and for future visits from grandchildren.  Very convenient, easy to use.  Easy to adjust to size of door.  Very satisfied.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This is the best baby gate I've ever used or seen. It's very sturdy, and fits tightly in the 29"" entry way to my kitchen.  Despite my baby's best effort the gate doesn't budge a millimeter when he pulls on it.  The best part though is the foot pedal. It really does work hands free, just step down on the pedal and nudge it open with your knee. You do have to put a lot of weight on the pedal to open it, but this is good, because no matter how much a baby or toddler pushes or jumps on the pedal it won't open for them.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We have used this gate for our children then bought another for our puppy.  This is truly a wonderful gate for the mom/dad with hands full and only has a foot available to open the gate.  Very nice looking too and a quality that will last a long time.  Even after our sons got old enough to pull on it, it still was a solid product that was great.  I highly recommend it as a mom to other moms and dads.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,We've had this gate for a year and a half and have been very pleased with it. Until tonight when my two year got her knee stuck in the gate. I was on one side with liquid soap while my husband was on the other trying to stretch the rails. After a few seconds we got her out. But now we are looking at other gates to replace this one.,1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"the gate looks as if it was defective because the bars don't look straight, but as the instruction says, once you pressure mount it, it works fine.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"Perfect for an autistic child! The gate arrived quickly and in perfect condition. The set up was so easy I didn't even need to look at the directions. You don't need any extra tools, just the small plastic wrench that comes with the gate. Make sure to keep it in a safe place so you can tighten things up every now and then. My son is almost 3 years old and has autism. Every gate we've ever had, he could get out of. Most of the times he ended up breaking them! This gate is perfect, too tall to climb over and too strong to wiggle loose. If anybody could take this gate to its limits, it would be my son. We've had the gate for over two months now, and it's still as strong as the day I set it up. The foot pedal is great too! Hands free entry is a breeze and it's strong enough to keep a 7 year old in!",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This has to be the best baby gate out there.  We have 2 of them in our house, 1 for almost a year and the other for 6 months.  They hold up great, are very strong and stable, and are easy to open for the adult to allow walkthrough into a room.  I would highly recommend this product.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We do not have kids, but we have two of these for our dog.  It is great because you can be carrying a load of laundry or (I can imagine a child) and still get through the gate easily.  You step on the peddle and bump it with your knee and it pops open.  It is easy to swing shut as well.It is funny my dog knows how it works and tries to bat his paw at the peddle, but he will not ever be able to open the gate because he cannot put enough pressure down.*******Now that we have children (2 years later) this has proven to be a great gate still.  It is in excellent condition and we have purchased 2 additional gates since our son is now walking********",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,We bought one of these gates at a garage sale before our baby was due a couple of years ago. I didn't know anything about it and didn't even really know what we'd use it for. We LOVE this gate!!! So much that we just bought another one new. The vertical bars are great to keep kids (or dogs) from climbing over it. The step peddle is way too hard to push down for my son to manage (he's 28 months old) even if he tries - which he really doesn't. :) I frequently have hands full so the ease of opening without hands is hugely useful and appreciated. It's also easy to control and can be opened and closed very quietly if you have someone napping nearby. The only suggestion I'd make is to clean under it regularly if you have lots of animals and/or dirt in the house. I know that sounds funny but we have one in a doorway and when we shut the door it will push the foot pedal and move the gate a smidge each time. We also have a houseful of animals and dirt and I didn't think to take the gate out to clean under it regularly so the dirt from the motion of the gate wore away at the finish on the hardwood floor underneath. Not the gate's fault! Love these gates!,5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I've had hand me down baby gates, store bought baby gates.  When I saw this gate at my co-workers house I just had to have it. Easy to install, even easier to operate.  Even Grandma and Grandpa have no problem operating it.  I ordered a second one to replace an existing gate.  I will never go back to any other gate.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We just purchased this gate and are very happy with it! Our baby will not be arriving for two more months, but I am on modified bedrest and can no longer step over the gate we had been using. This one is very well built and easy to install, does not damage the walls at all, and is easy to use! It costs significantly less than other pressure mounted gates and is the only one I have seen with a threshold to prevent tripping. Our main purpose for this gate right now is to keep the dogs out of the dinning room. My only gripe is that our cats have both attempted to squeeze through the bars and ended up stuck and needing help. This is probably no fault of the manufacturer. We are working to teach our lazy cats to jump over the gate. So, overall, a really great gate! But be cautious if you have cats.",4
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I wish I had gotten this gate long ago!  While I'm currently pregnant with our first child, we also have a dog that has required the use of gates and this could have saved us a lot of aggravation over those years.  It installs so easily (especially considering we live in an older house with out of square and irregularly sized doorways) and stays put.  The door pedal is accessible from both sides and the gate door also swings either way, making entry and exit from the same room super easy.  The opening isn't very wide, but our doorways aren't very wide in this house to begin with and it's certainly wide enough to go through without any major adjustments, so it doesn't really seem like a drawback to me.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This thing has now survived up to two 90th percentile twin 2yo boys yanking on it day after day.  I bought an incline stoop thing for the bottom, and I did put a couple of screws in the door frame where the top compression feet meet just to keep them from pushing it out.  And, the lever action foot pedal is a little heavy for smaller adults, but man this thing has taken a beating and never failed.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This is the best baby product i have purchased since my son was born 13 months ago.  I have many wonderful baby items, that i thoroughly enjoy, but this is the first one that has no apparent flaws.  It was extremely easy to install, even with two extensions (required for wider doorways/hallways)(no tools needed), is sturdy, looks good, prevents my son from going into unwanted territory, and is comfortable for adults. The bars are conviently spaced (not too far, not too close).  I would highly recommend this product.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We've tried a dozen different gates and this one works the best.  They don't fall down, they are easy to use.  We have 3 in our house. We use them for dogs and they are perfect.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I am so at ease since I purchased this gate.  After purchasing the cheap wooden ones and the safety first gate i was extremely dissappointed.  My 12 month old daughter would rip it off the wall.  This gate is excellent.  It's easy to install,and operate and it helps block our bulldog from roaming the house as well.  Im going to purchase another one for my kitchen but i will need to order two extensions so that it fits the 44"" door way.  Worth the 49 bucks.  However they charge way too much for the extension kit. 14.99 for 5 inches and you usually need 2.  but there is no $ tag on safety.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,Just what we were looking for. We have twins and wanted something strong but we can use hands free. We definitely recommend this product.,5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"The product is a great idea, but after a few months of use the foot pedals on the two I bought both broke off.Do not buy this product until this problem is fixed.",1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,We use this gate on our deck for the dogs.  The convenience of the swinging gate activated by the foot peddle is great.  And we don't have to worry about the dogs figuring it out.,5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I LOVE IT!!!!  One of the best investments I've made as this is perfect to have a permanent gate to keep my 4 maltese doggies in one room when I need to go out.  I tried 3 other gates for this purpose but my one malt could climb over all of them but with this gate she can't because of the vertical bars, there's no way for her to climb it.  Also the pedal opens the gate door very easily, and the door can stay open until I need to close it giving me complete access to the room when the gate is not needed.  The gate is sturdy, well made and the complete package.  Well worth the money it costs..",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I ordered this gate last week and just received it Wednesday. My 2 1/2 year old opened it 5 minutes after it was installed. He stands on the pedal and jumps up and down until the gate pops open. Obviously if we're right there we stop him, but sometimes mom needs a bathroom break. We ended up going to the store to buy a different type of gate. Too bad since on the economy we have to pay in euros. :(Guess this gate is only meant for kids younger than 2 1/2.",3
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"The gate did not fit into the entrance of our staircase and although the website of the manufacturer claims that there are extensions, none could be found on the site.Even though I could not complete the installation, the product itself did not inspire much confidence that it was going to withstand what we demanded of it, namely keeping our toddler daughter from falling down the stairs.In addition, the pieces used to put together the gate were of poor quality and tolerance.  One only wishes that the manufacturers of such products understood that when dealing with safety, short-cuts in quality should never be tolerated.",2
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We bought this gate on a recommendation from a friend, whose toddler is quite active and climbing everywhere.  This was definitely one of the best purchases we've made.  It is easy to install (NO TOOLS!) and even easier to use.  It's high enough that my toddler isn't trying to climb over it, and sturdy enough to where she isn't shaking on it to make it come loose.  It is an excellent gate.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We needed a gate for my son who is all over the place, what a great purchase. I even got the extensions for my wall. My husband and I think it was the best investment ever. Very easy to install. One thing about the gate that is really great, you don't have to put screws into the wall and damage your walls. That was my biggest concern. What an invention. Thank you to the company who made this gate.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I love this gate!  I bought it for our 1 year old twin boys to block them off from our entry way and stairs.  I wanted something pressure mounted that would not mar our walls, yet would withstand my monkeys and this is it!  The hands free gate is great too because the amount of pressure required to release the gate requires an adult to step on it-my eight year old nieces had a difficult time getting it to open with their body weight.  My sons grab onto the rails and pull themselves up and try to shake it back and forth and it doesn't move!  It was very easy to install-it was a great investment.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"Okay so I have 2 completely different reviews for this gate. My mother purchased this gate for her home and it is excellent for all the reasons 5 star reviewers gave. It is truly hands free and it does its job. Easily installed and no problems.The second review is I then purchased it for my mother in laws home and i would give it a 1 star. My 6 lb dog got his head and neck caught in between the rails. THANK GOD we were all sitting down for dinner and caught it immediatly. My 2 1/2 yr old figured out how to open the gate by putting all her weight on the pedal and bouncing up and down while pushing on the door. She is 26lbs, average weight for her age.She does not open it at my mothers house b/c she doesnt have a need to get to the other side.(all her toys are with her so seh is content.)I will let you decide. Their are many positives and you will always read negatives for any product. I now have to purchase a gate for my home and I extremly nervous to buy this product. I believe I will go for the extra tall top of the stair gate, even though it is not truly hands free and might end up being a pain to open. I believe I will be more comfortable with it in the end.",3
The First Years Hands Free Gate,Our escape artist dachshund was able to climb over our previous mesh gate.  With the vertical bars on this gate she has no choice but to stay in the laundry room.  Gate was easy to setup.  The top brackets must be tightened a lot to get the top latch to catch.,5

The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This gate works perfectly.  We live in an old house, with doorways that are not square.  This gate can be adjusted for any doorway.  It is also tall enough that my 2-year-old can't climb over it.  We love it!",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We've had two of these gates for six months and have been almost 100% happy with them. The other reviewers who note that some parts are made of cheap plastic are right - one of the little click thingies on the bottom of one of our two gates get stuck more than it should, but it still works well enough for our purposes. We love how they open and close by pushing on the pedal (ours has worked perfectly, although I see that some had said that theirs breaks) and opening with the knee. We use them to block off parts of our house to our one year old and have used them since he started to crawl. We are ordering a third one to block off the stairway upstairs now. Based on our experience and reading many reviews before deciding which gate to buy, it is my sense that for the price, most people are very happy with this gate. You might be able to spend double or triple and get THE PERFECT GATE, but really this one will probably do for about everyone. There are a few that break more than they should and very rarely a toddler that can figure out how to open them. However, our child tends to be the investigative type and has thus far made no progress learning to open the gate. This seems to be a good, decent popular working gate for most people and needs. I recommend it.",4
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We've tried at least three different gates in different doorways and entrances, and this one's by far the best. It really is hands-free to open. Better yet, it closes automatically by bumping it shut, unlike some gates that require a hand to *close* them, argh.One complaint I've heard is about the foot pedal breaking off. That hasn't happened for us, and we use two of these, nor has it happened for friends (and friends of friends) who've had one of these for several years. I suspect that anyone's who broke had the gate in the entrance either too tightly or crooked. So, use the tool that comes in the box for checking the tightness, and use a level(ing device) to get it straight.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This gate has been absolutely wonderful in keeping our son safe.  It's easy to install and use, and we've had no complaints about it at all.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"Instructions did not mention taking a metal piece off the top wall mount screws.  It attaches very securely, and my kids can not shake it down.  However, my 3.5 yr old also can not open it by himself, to let him out of the gated area to the bathroom.  Otherwise it was super easy to install, looks very nice, and fit my 34"" doorway.  If it had some sort of way to ""lock"" it open as well, that would be nice too, so that we could prevent it from shutting by itself.",4
The First Years Hands Free Gate,I purchased this gate to keep my two new puppies in a secluded area so they would not destroy my house....it worked perfectly,5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,I have tried several gates to keep my small dog in areas where he is not wanted and LOVE this gate.  I now have 3 of them.,5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,Thank you for such a good product.  I use it in my clinic.  There are lots of little ones who crawl all over the floor and this keeps them in a confined area.  The ability for them to see through the gate is excellent.  The little ones are able to see everything we do without being in the same area.,5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This hands-free gate works when you step down on the foot paddle which causes a latch to open. You can then push the gate open with a hand or a knee. The gate is fairly easy to install (a necessary slim wrench is included in the box) and requires no screws or glue. The gate provides good protection. The bars on the gate are well-spaced so even small infants shouldn't be able to crawl through. When properly installed, it provides solid protection, although (important!) you should regularly check it to make sure it's securely affixed to the door frame. Also, over time the gate tends to bend a little, so you should use the little wrench-like tool to adjust it when necessary.In short, a very good gate for keeping kids out of a certain room. But this is *NOT* designed and should never be used to guard the top of a stairway.",4
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"As other reviewers have mentioned- great gate for kids. One thing I wanted to note: GREAT gate if you have cats. This gate stops children, but my 15lb+ male tabby can pass through an ever-so-slightly-larger gap on either side of the gate. Keeps baby out of the kitty litter room, but poor cat doesn't have to make any huge jumps. Baby and pet friendly!",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,Wonderful product for animals but not two-year old children.  The two-year old figured out how to open the door repeatedly after studying the mechanism for 20 minutes.,3
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We have had the hands free gate for nearly 10 months and have been very happy with it. I took note of all the reviews that said the plastic pedal breaks easily, and so immediately we got into the habit of making sure we don't step on the edge of the pedal but rather fully on the pedal right up to where it meets the gate. This would seem to preserve the integrity of the pedal, and so far we have not had any broken parts and couldn't be more pleased with our choice. It's in our kitchen doorway, so it gets tons of use and lots of traffic. The opening is narrow but you get used to it. Best of all, our 2 year old loves to close it (she can' t open it of course) and there doesn't seem to be any place where she could get her fingers stuck in it. And finally, it could not be easier to install -- NO TOOLS!!!!!  A real winner!",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I looked at a lot of gates and thought this one looked the best.  For one thing I only need it at times when my grandchildren visit from out of state which is not as often as we would like since they are all over 2000 miles away.  This one was better than the wooden ones which fall down so easily and are a nuisance to open and close. I liked the idea that it could be installed without a lot of hardware and putting holes in my walls.  By appearances it looked like it would do the job of keeping my grandchildren in the parts of the house where we wanted them without the adults having to canstantly keep them out of rooms that are off limits.  The theory was great--the reality was different.  Within the first day of their visit, my 27 month old grandson not only had figured out how the gate opened but he was also able to open it on his own and thus defeated the whole purpose of the gate.  I spent a lot of money on something that didn't work.",2
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This product is a lot different from other baby gates because of the &#34;hand free&#34; foot pedal at the bottom used to open the gate. Not only did I find it not TOTALLY hands free, but it blocked her bedroom door from completely closing. Nice and sturdy, though.",3
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"A great product!  Perfect to keep our dogs out of our newborn daughter's room, and great for opening and closing with one foot while you carry your infant in your arms.  We had a different baby gate before this one, which was good, but we would never go back to it.  This one is just too convenient!",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We also have a foot pedal that has broken within the first 6 months. The problem seems to be when people press down on the edge of the pedal. That puts stress on the center, where it is attached to the gate, and cracks it. (A metal pedal might solve this issue.) The hands-free feature is a great find! We haven't noticed a big problem with the narrow width of the gate's opening. We'll get the pedal replaced since we can't find another product that suits our needs any better.",3
The First Years Hands Free Gate,This gate is perfect!  It looks great and works just like it says.  Be sure to measure your door.  I didn't and had to use this in a different door and get something even wider for the original door!  I love this gate.,5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We bought this gate for our 5 month old Keeshond puppy (We also have a 6 yr, old Samoyed). I received it today and installed it myself, very easy to install after reading the instructions. No drilling into the doorways required, and it's sturdy, very safe and secure. I love the foot pedal to open it and it goes swings both ways. This is the 4th gate we have for our dogs. So far this is my favorite. I hope we get a couple of years use out of this gate.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,This is the best gate I have ever purchased! I got it to keep my dogs contained to one area when need be! They can see whats going on on the other side and the best part is it opens hands free! JUST STEP on pedal! Wish they made these when my kids were little!,5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I owned this gate with my 2nd child.  It broke after only 4 months.  I tried it again with my 3rd child thinking that perhaps it was just a fluke that it broke.  However, it is EXTREMEMLY DANGEROUS.  My son is 12 months old, and in the past week, he has gotten his knee stuck 5 times!  Thankfully, somebody was with me each time, so one adult could pry at the bars of the gate, while the other greased his knee with butter and gently tried to pull it out.  Tonight, however, it really hurt his knee/thigh.  VERY BAD PRODUCT.  THIS GATE HURTS KIDS!",1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I bought this gate to keep my 14 month old daughter in or out of the kitchen, depending on the circumstances.  I was a little worried that the pressure mounts would mar the walls, but they don't.  The mounts screw to apply lateral pressure to the wall.  The wall contacts never turn or move as the pressure builds.The gate is well-designed.  My daughter has enjoyed closing the door and then shaking the gate.  She's basically been all over this thing and hasn't injured herself yet.  There are virtually no places for little feet to get any purchase to climb, and the locking mechanism makes it nearly impossible for little fingers to get caught and injured.  It's simple to open for adults, and little ones just don't have the weight to step down on the unlocking mechanism.We had a shipping snafu as well and some of the pressure mounts didn't arrive.  I contacted First Years' customer service and explained the problem and they shipped another pressure mount at no charge.  I'm a happy customer.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"First off, let me explain I only give 5 stars to great items!  This is a great gate.  We've had it over a year and its still going strong.When looking for a gate with baby #2, we wanted something our older one could open but the little one could not.  Now, this one has a foot pedal you have to push down on, and also push open the gate at the same time.  Its tricky for kids.  My 3 yr old neice couldn't do it, but my 4 1/2 yr old got it down pat with a few days of practice.  It holds up really well - she has to jump up and down on it and push the gate at the same time before it will open - it requires enough pressure to open where a younger child wouldn't be able to open it. (And if she just stands on the foot pedal, it doesn't move.  It needs more force).I love that its hands-free, just step down and use your knee to push it open. Its swings either way, and I love that it will stand open and not auto-close.  Sometimes you don't want it closed! It is sturdy - it stands up to being slammed 10 times a day by the older one and several more by me, plus being shaken by the toddler, PLUS the 40 lb puppy running into it and trying to push it open at least 4 times a day.I have found only 2 small complaints - 1) We have had to adjust it a couple times when the locking mechanism gets offset.  Honestly, I am pretty sure that is due to my older one slamming it in the same direction every time.  Its a quick adjustment with the plastic wrench and voila!  2) While it has not yet happened, I am concerned the knee knocker feature I love so much will become a place for the toddler to put his foot and try to climb over.  Of course, he won't be able to actually get over it, and really if a toddler is climbing that much any gate will be a problem. :)A few people have complained the swing-thru gate opening is smaller than other gates.  I honestly hand't noticed, and I have rather wide hips.  I clear it just fine.All in all, this gate is convenient, stylish, and takes a lot of abuse.  Well worth the money in my book.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I have a relatively new dog who thinks my older cats are fascinating.  They don't feel the same way about her.  I got this gate for my home office so the kitties/I can get some peace when the dog is being a little overexcited.I have several other gates- the North (??) removable tension baby gate and the extra tall Carlson pet gate.  The North gate was fine but annoying to step over or take down often throughout the day.  This gate is taller than that and has the obvious advantage of a door.  The Carlson door is taller than this one, but that's about the only advantage for me.  The Carlson gate required being screwed into the doorway as the tension did not hold it in place well enough to withstand a dog jumping lightly on it.  The cat door on the Carlson wasn't good for me as my 35lb dog fit right through.This gate! on the other hand, is great.  The tension is sufficient to not screw into the door without preventing the door from opening.  The foot pedal works well- requires enough pushing that my dog is unlikely to do it on her own.  I love that the door swings both ways and locks easily back in place.  This door is also wider than the Carlson gate.  Overall, I'm very pleased with this gate.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"When we first put up this gate I was in love! How easy for us and our 2 older daughters to operate. Then as our son grew into a vivacious 1, now 2, year old. He was able to yank the gate free from where it was placed at the bottom of the stairs. Now not only are both bottom rubber feet ripped off but my paint has really suffered too. The gate now swings from the bottom and does not keep my 2 yr. old from going up the stairs. I recommend this for the bottom of the stairs ONLY. There is to much of a risk that a little one can push it out of place even when VERY tightly secured.",3
The First Years Hands Free Gate,very good gate the only down fall is that it is only hands free gate if the mobile home or house or apartment is leveled other than that it is perfect and hand free and easy to install and it is alot harder to knock down than other baby gates my daughter could never knock this gate down no matter how hard she tried even when she was a year in a half she would stand on it and lean on it and it still wouldn't fall so it is all round a very good gate.,5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We've been using this gate for about 5 months.  We've got two large dogs and one very mobile 14 month old, and this has kept all three where they're supposed to be.  It's easy enough to install that it goes to Grandma's with no problem.Only issue is that after constant use, the spring in the release step seems to be acting up a little and it's a bit harder to open, but this is definitely worth the price.  The door is secure when closed, and there's no way a precocious toddler is getting through there.  We are very happy with this gate.",4
The First Years Hands Free Gate,This gate is excellent. I love the hands free feature. Gate was easy to install.,5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We love this gate!  Orginally 1 bought to keep our dog out of the cat's food.  Now that we have a baby, I'm buying at least 2 more.  It is so easy and convenient to use.The only problem we have with it is that you can't close the door with the gate attached.  However, 2 of the three places we are using this gate are just openings with no door anyway, so it is not a big problem.  I would have loved to have used this gate on baby's bedroom, too, but then I couldn't close the door!",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"The King of baby gates. I almost didn't buy this because consumer reports didn't rate it well especially on the safety dimension. I don't know what they were smoking, because this is an awesome baby gate. It is so easy to get through yet it is solid and kid proof. I was afraid that the little one would be able to depress the foot pedal. NOT SO. My one year old can't budge it. My three year old can move it a little, but not anywhere enough to open it. My six year old has to jump up and down on it a little, but can open it. For me, no handed operation is a dream come true. Perfect gate.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,What's not to like this gate is easy to install and with the extensions can fit wider openings than the standard safety gate. Good design and ease of use make it convenient to open without using hands and having to set everything down to work the gate. Very secure gate as latching mechanism holds securely. Would recommend this gate for anyone looking for an attractive and safe gate to protect their child or even their pets.,5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"Overall we are satisfied with the First Years Hands Free Gate. We ended up needing both extensions for the bottom of our staircase.  I didn't measure and wish I would have but I just guessed we wouldn't need them because it doesn't seem like an abnormally large stairway.  The opening is a little narrow which means I have to turn sideways to not knock my son's legs into it when I'm carrying him through it.  I do like that it feels much more secure than other gates we've tried in the same space.  The top and bottom area where the gate sits are not the same width which made this particular gate perfect because we adjusted it.  My 5 year old daugther has to jump on the lever with both feet to open it but now she navigates it without much difficulty at all.  Overall, we are pleased but we just ended up spending more money than we intended due to the extensions needed.",4
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This gate looks good, its sturdy and very easy to use.Its the best gate I have ever had and well worth the money,I have used it for my dogs for 10 yrsI recently bought another one because I am paranoid they will stop making it andmine will eventually wear out ( so far no sign of that but my motto is be prepared!  ) lol",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"With two rambunctious dogs and a baby on the way I wanted a gate I could have my hands full and still open. This is perfect. My husband was skeptical about the foot pedal opening at first. But my 3 yr old niece came over, tried to get in the nursery and it wouldn't budge!! Love it!",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We love this gate!  Very well constructed, and works like a charm.  Easy to open and close, and secure.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"Got three of these gates after seeing one in action at a friend's house. They keep our little girl out of places we don't want her to be unaccompanied and keep the cats out of rooms where they like to go and do naughty things (also prevents them from scratching at doors they want to open). We have to periodically tighten them up, thanks to constant traffic and less than gentle use by siblings, so hold on to those little plastic wrenches that come with them. Can be tough for children age 6-10 to open because of weight needed to trigger release. Perfect for standard width doorways with wooden doorjambs. Pressure against the door jamb or wall holds them in place, so be careful if it's just sheetrock.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This gate was great for a barrier gate for my school age kids and for a temporay gate for our baby.  It would be good for pets.However, when my baby turned 12 months he figured how to take off the foot press, when he applied a little pressure to the gate without the foot press the gate would open. Therefor, he was free to rome the house and we caught him heading head first down the stairs within seconds of pushing this gate open.  This gate needs to be remodified!  I feel bad that I have to be negative-- this is not our nature!  However, our kids come first!!!",1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This gate is amazing.  I have 3 dogs and use it to keep them out of  areas that are off limits.  It is fantastic!Easy to install, reasonably priced, excellent quality,easy to use.  I like it so much I am thinking of buying another one just in case anything ever happens to the one  have.  Its one of those itemsthat is so good you can't imagine having to do without it.  Well worth the price.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I researched all the reviews on gates, and decided on this one.  It had a positive response from others, so I decided to spend the extra money.  This is a great gate.  I had to buy the extentions, but the assembly is very easy!  Just make sure to use the wrench provided to tighten the top part of the gate together.  The foot pedal is easy, yet your young children won't be able to open it.  My dogs and cats even can't get past the gate.  I was suprised to see that my cats don't try to jump over it.  Highly recommend!",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"great product. the hands free gate ensures that my wife will not trip over the old doggy gate as she's bringing dinner out of the kitchen. loved it so much we put them in all the doors we want to keep the dogs out of, very easy n quick to install.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"The bar across the bottom is very tall and creates a terrible trip hazard.  We boxed this item up and returned it as we imagined ourselves, baby in hand, falling down the stairs after we tripped over this gate.  Really silly design.",1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"My house was built in 1899 so our doorways are all 30"" wide.  This gate fit perfectly without the extension, so I can't comment on that.The gate was super easy to install once I read the instructions and it works wonders.  We wanted a gate on the nursery to keep our pets out, but still be able to keep the door open for air flow and easy peeks.  Regular pressure mounted gates involved a dangerous balance trying to step over them (too lazy to remove and remount them every time), so this was ideal.  The foot pedal takes a few tries to get really fast at stepping on without having to stop and look for it, but once you get used to it, it's seamless going in and out.  The ""click"" of the gate when it closes may disturb very light sleeping babies, but we leave a fan running in the room for white noise and the click has not been a problem yet.The construction of this gate is excellent.  I love the threshhold at the bottom to avoid tripping.  The gate itself is metal (so very easy to wipe clean) and the bars are set close enough that my cat has not been able to get through them.  I plan to get 2 more of these when crawling starts.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"easy to install and so easy to use, it's just a great product. I love it. It delivers what it promises",4
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"the gate fits perfectly & was easy to install. once in place the gate was sturdy enough for my 13 month old daughter. i am very happy w/ this gate. i was  a bit concerned when i opened the box & saw that the gate & lock did not fit, but after i tightened it on the door frame, the gate now fits perfectly.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We got this gate to help keep our dogs separate from our bedroom and it works fine for that. I am also pregnant right now and the gate was a replacement for a stationary gate that we used before that I had to step over. Our thoughts were that once we have the baby this will be very useful when you have your hands full (of baby).Well we ordered this gate after reading all of the other reviews and I have to say that I was a little disappointed when we got it all setup. The setup was simple enough and very easy, but the reviews and images led me to believe that the gate would have a transitional piece that would lay on the floor as a sort of bumper to the bottom support rail that helped prevent toe stubs and general tripping. Unfortunately this gate did not include that. I read before I ordered that you may receive either of the two different styles (one has a flat top and one has an arched top). Well we received the one with the arched top and that one doesn't come with the transition piece for some reason. (It's noted that you will receive one or the other style top, but nothing about other pieces of the product being different).Also, the images and description show that the gate has a knee plate that allows you to bump open the gate once you step on the lever. Ours did not come with this either. You can still hit the gate with your knee to open it, but you're ""bumping"" metal bars, so it's not as comfy. I see a bruise in my future if I don't get the lever pressed down far enough and go to ""bump it open"". It does still operate as described, just not as comfortable to open hands free as we originally thought. The foot lever does take a good deal of pressure to depress, which means a child or animal couldn't open it, but I've found it's sometimes difficult for me to make sure that I've depressed the lever all the way to the floor before I go to swing the gate open. Also, our lever is very squeaky which I assume we can correct with some WD40, we just haven't attempted yet. (We'll need to do this before the baby comes because the noise is definitely loud enough to wake him up if we walked through the gate when he was sleeping.) There were some concerns noted about the width being more narrow, but as a 5 month pregnant lady, it is comfortable to walk through to me and doesn't feel too narrow.I would recommend that Amazon rework the description of this product.",2
The First Years Hands Free Gate,I bought this gate when my baby just started crawling.  She is now a year old and walking everywhere.  This gate is wonderful and I'm getting ready to buy 2 more for her room and my room.  I currently use it in our play room to keep her away from the stairs.  I have 2 older daughters that use it all the time to go in and out 100 times a day.  I have not had any problems with anything breaking as of yet even with the abuse of my other children.  I love being able to open the gate with one foot and my knee.  It has been a life saver for our family.  Wish I had this years ago with my other two children.,5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,We bought this gate and two extenders.Then our 98lb nephew to put it to the test.Hes too light to push it open so I know my son is safe with it for atleast 3-4 years but I'll be jumping up to open it all the time.We left it open at nap time and found that he could use his hands to swing on it without the gate slipping from the wall.This told me that if my son runs head first it wont fall down so easy.Its a really sturdy safe gate.I'm going to have to give up the gate because theres a gap between my wall and the bars that looks too big for my comfort.I love the gate itself because it has passed my nephews distruction test.,3
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This has been a great gate for us. We did not want to have to drill into the walls, so the twisting dials are great. the door also swings both ways, for easy opening from either side. We will be purchasing more of them. We needed the extension for it, and that's really easy to install too!",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We really like this gate by First Years! We did not want to have to put any permanent screws into our door frame and since this gate is blocking a high traffic througway, the hands-free design is awesome! The design has bars that are attached vertically, so little one will NOT be able to climb it. The gate is VERY sturdy and heavy duty, and the pressure created when tightened is VERY strong as well; we have NO CONCERNS that this gate will wobble, dislodge or in any way be a danger to our son. We have been using it for over a month now and are very pleased. We recommend this to anyone with a young child.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"My 11-month-old was climbing another gate that we had, so I decided to try this one.  This has given us peace of mind to know that he will not be able to climb over head first.This gate is well designed (with an improved foot pedal that will eliminate the previous complaints of it breaking) and easy to use.Although I did find the instructions to be somewhat ambiguous, it was relatively easy to install.The only complaint is the actual opening is narrow, about 18 inches, and could be cumbersome for moving large objects (or people for that matter) through the opening without detaching the entire gate from the doorway.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"Product delivered on description.  Easy to use, install, and hands free.  It says it's not approved for use at the top of the stairs because the only gates approved for use at the top of the stairs are hardware mounted ones, so I just put it in the hallway right before the stairs and works great.  Although it's so sturdy, if there wasn't the rule about needing to be hardware mounted it would work for stairs.  I'm not sure how old the people's children are who said they can open this gate, but mine is 1 and there's no way he's strong enough.  In order to open the gate you have to have a good amount of leg strength that I wouldn't anticipate younger kids having.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We bought this gate to keep our son out of the kitchen. It was very easy to install. The adjustable screws are gerat if you have molding around the base of your walls. All 4 points of contact adjust seperatly so the moldings doesn't get in the way.The foot pedal is very easy to use and is great when you have your hands full. Some reviewers have comented on the durability of the gate and pedal. We have used our gate for over a year and not had any problem with anything breaking. It is in a pretty high traffic area and shows no signs of wear and tear.Our son is a climber and he can't climb over the gate and even though he has figured out how the gate works he simply is not heavy enough to use the pedal.The only word of caution is if you have a door way that is wider than normal it may not fit, so check the specs before buying.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We bought this gate to keep our toddler from going down the hallway.  It has been a wonderful tool and I highly recommend it.  The only thing that has happened is every once in a while the pressure mountings seem to get loose.  However, it doesn't take anything to tighten them up again.  The gate has never budged as far as coming lose from the wall.  We have been very, very pleased with this gate and it swings open and closed at least 200 times a day at our house!!",4
The First Years Hands Free Gate,Besides the easy installation of this gate.  It's totally safe for Very very active toddlers.  My son started climb & walking @ 9 months.  Every other gate we had he could climb & of course got stuck.  There is no way for toddlers to climb this gate. Beleive me my son has tried.This is the best gate out there.,5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"It works great, is very sturdy and easy to install! Definitely recommend it to anyone  needing a gate-I happen to be restricting Dogs but the hands free option really works and works well!",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This gate is so wonderful, I just had to write a review. Everyone that comes to our house and uses ours ends up getting one too. Like others, we had purchased ""cheapo"" gates that were supposedly pressure mounted and easy to remove. What a waste of money. We have two of these and they are permanently mounted and are VERY secure. Because we can easily go in/out, we never have to deal with wall damage, tripping over them while attempting to climb over, and they keep the kids and dog out of unsafe areas. It's very easy to open with the pedel and push with your knee, so it truly is a ""hands-free"" gate. I do agree that you need that little wrench to install this securely, but my husband did it without a problem. One of the two required the extension and that was also easy and secure to install. One thing I will mention is that my (almost) 3-year old can NOT open this gate. In our house that is a good thing, however, the age limit says 2 years so I thought that I would mention this in case you want a gate your preschoolers can also open (we do not).

The First Years Hands Free Gate,"The reviews on this gate convinced my husband and me to order this gate for our 1 year old son (the great price was an added plus).  I installed this in my kitchen in a doorway near the basement stairs in approx. 20 minutes by myself.  I love it!!  We previously had a gate that we had to step over installed in this same doorway and I was so tired of hurdling over it w/laundry, etc.  This gate is sturdy and just what we were looking for - so thank you for all of the great reviews that helped us which is why I wanted to let others know what we think as well!!",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"DO NOT try to use for stairs with wooden banisters. Super easy assembly but we found that they require such pressure on each side to close gate properly that instead of securing into place, it actually pulled the banister from the wall.",2
The First Years Hands Free Gate,I love the foot petal.  You can walk in with hands full of graceries or a child in arms and you can easily enter with the foot petal and your knee to push the gate forward.We are currently using this to keep a dog out of a particular area in the house and it is fantastic for pets as well as kids!,5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,This seems to be well made but I have a 4 month old toy poodle.  Weighs 3.2 pounds.  She gets over this.  Not good for any dog since they don't come too much smaller than mine,2
The First Years Hands Free Gate,THIS GATE WAS EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED. A GREAT VALUE FOR THE MONEY.IT WAS VERY EASY TO INSTALL WITH NO TOOLS REQUIRED TO INSTALL IT.The First Years Hands Free Gate,5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I have this gate in a standard doorway and it works so well! We are renting a town home with stairs so we wanted something that was pressure mounted. I also love the hands-free capabilities of this gate. I love it especially because my youngest isn't walking yet but is a very curious, active crawler. Great buy!",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We have two.  Works great, but the older one (6 months old or so) is sticky so it takes some effort for even adults to pass.  The newer one is perfect, but who knows if the &#34;stickiness&#34; develops over time.  Still, easy to install and I obviously like it since I bought a second one.",4
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"A couple of my friends had recommended this gate to us so I thought we'd give it a shot since I really needed something sturdy at the stairs.  Problem #1 with this gate is that it does not extend to the width that most staircases are so you'll need to get two extensions per gate.  Since we bought two gates, we had to get four extensions so we ended up spending more money than we intended to.  Then the vendor CrazyforBabies send them to us without any protection so one of them was cracked and damaged. Problem #2 is that if your child is heavy enough, he/she can open the gates by themselves.  My daughter was 2 and weighted about 25lbs when she first opened the gate.  My friend told me that she has the same problem with her 3 year old son.  Problem #3 is that if you close the gate too quickly, the latches doesn't catch on and the door will swing toward you.  Scary thought if your child is there because the corner of the gate can do some serious injury.  But other than these problems, it's okay.  I had other gates before and it was much worst.",3
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This gate is AMAZING!  We purchased this gate to block off the kitchen when our Quadruplets began to crawl.  They are now 13 months old and this thing is yanked on beat on kicked, you name it, this thing gets abused.  Yet it still functions and stands the same as the day I bought it.&#60;br /&#62;I could NOT imagine life without this hands free feature.  Its easy for me to open while holding a kid on each hip or carrying bottles out to the feeding area.&#60;br /&#62;Push it open with your knee, slam it closed with a push of your leg.  Couldnt get any easier!&#60;br /&#62;Another plus to this gate is it's height.  It is much taller than average gates and is constructed in a way where your little one(s) can't climb over it.&#60;br /&#62;We just purchased a new house and will need 4 more gates... we will purchase 4 more of THIS gate for sure!",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I have this gate in my hallway upstairs and I love it!  Yes the passthrough on the gate is a little smaller then others, but it hasn't bothered me a bit.  And, they now are making the mechanics of the foot pedal out of metal and just the covering is plastic.  :)  We got out of buying the extension kit by going to the lumber yard and getting two scrap 2 x 4 pieces, spraying them white, and putting them on either side inbetween the gate and wall.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"Bought this gate three months ago to help keep my puppy safe in the kitchen while we are gone during the day. It has worked like a charm! No more wooden busted up gates to lift each time or climb over! OUr puppy was actually climbing the wooden gates by placing her paws inbetween the fencing! Not only could she have gotten hurt, but think about this . . . if she can fit her paws in there then surely a toddler could figure that out too! The HandsFreeGate eliminates the worry your child may climb it. They can't on this gate! All of my friends will get this gate at their baby showers!",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This is the best gate.  Before we had children, we had a basset.  The need for gates became apparent once we moved to a larger home.  We ended up with door ways which are larger than standard doorways.  We tried lots and lots of other gates.  This was the only one that we could get to fit and that would open easily and leave an adult with two hands free (which after baby entered the picture became a very important item.)  We love this gate, and in fact, still have one gate in place even though the ""baby"" is now four and the basset is now seven.  It's sturdy, easy for an adult to open and has held up really well.  I would definitely recommend it!",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,I have researched every gate on the market at this point.  So far we are extremely happy with this gate.  We wanted pressure mounted gates but I was concerned that the opening of this particular gate would not be wide enough for my husband.  I thought that he would have to turn sideways to get through the door and would not like it once used on a regular basis.  So far we are very satisfied customers and my husband can walk straight through the opening so the width meets our needs better than I anticipated.,5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,It is such a convenient gate.  Very sturdy.  A 5 year old can barely open it even if they know how.  LOVE IT,5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I broke the foot pedal on the first one of these I bought.  Manufacturer was great--promptly sent us a new one and paid all shipping costs.  New pedal design has given us no trouble.  We now have five Hands-Free Gates!  No other gate comes close.  One problem, Babies-R-Us doesn't stock enough extensions.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This is really a great gate for blocking out little people & little dogs! We have both.  It is easy to install & use, even my 5 yo can use it.We also have a yorkie mix dog that could get through the gate by going through the openings.  we had to put wiring up to stop him.",4
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"Loved the idea of having a hands free gate, but after using for a couple months the foot pedal started to come apart. Now the gate is extremely difficult to open and close. It has become a huge pain to use, I'll be switching back to my old hand operated gate that actually works!",2
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I love this gate, in fact we now have 2.  I did need to buy the extension for it, but that was not a big cost especially compared to the great quality and usefulness of the item!  First, I have molding along my baseboards, this is one of the few gates that adjusts to molding!  Second, my doorways are very wide and there are not many gates that have the extension. Third, it is more attractive than the plastic ugly gates.  Fourth, it is easy to open with the foot pedal and hard for a 2 year old to open.  Fifth, I love that it is a little door that opens, you don't have to move the whole thing out of the way to get through!  I highly recommend this gate.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"We absolutely love this gate! It was simple to install, easy for the adults and our 7 year old to operate, but keeps the baby and dogs where we want them! We use one hand or if they're full, just step on the pedal and nudge the gate with your knee. The baby is very mischevious and determined and has not been able to even budge this gate. No more stepping over the old pressure gate we had, which was awful and constantly knocked out of place.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This is a well made gate, wasn't difficult for my husband to install, and i LOVE that it has a foot pedal to open the gate when my hands are full.  It opens in either direction which is also nice.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"What a great idea, opening a gate with your foot! Loooooove it! It was easy to install, that means my non mechanical hubby placed it for me in like 10 minutes. It is pretty sturdy and so far and I'm super happy with this gate!",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,We've owned this for over two months now.  I just love this gate.1.  Does not require holes to be put in the walls.2.  Stays securely in place (my 1 yr old has tested that out).3.  Opens easily so you don't have to keep climbing over it.3.  High enough that the dog won't get over it (Rottweiler).I would definately purchase this gate again and again :o),5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I bought 6 other gates and none of them fit on my stairwell because I have molding trim around the bottom.  This gate was so easy to install and it is easy to open.  I did, however, have to buy 1 extension piece, but who cares.  It keeps my now 11 month old away from the steps! It was so easy I bought a 2nd one for the upstairs stairwell.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This gate is incredible!  I have 2 older children (10 and 8)and &quot;back in the day&quot; I used the plastic tension gate and stepped (tripped) over it carrying kids, toys, etc.  This is so easy to install and use, HANDS FREE!  I am so glad we have this gate this time around!  It is quite sturdy:  my HUGE 12 month old grabs the bars and shakes and it stays in place. I can step on the pedal and the door opens easily with my knee. It is worth the extra few bucks to have the hands free convenience everyday!",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,I RECEIVED THIS FOR MY BABY SHOWER AND AM VERY PLEASED! IT IS EASY TO OPEN WHILE CARRYING MY BABY AND KEEPS THE DOG IN THE FAMILY ROOM WHEN WE ARE AWAY. THE DOOR SWINGS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS WHICH IS TERRIFIC IN MY DOORWAY. I PLAN TO BUY MORE FOR THE REST OF THE HOUSE.,5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I really like this gate, it was easy to install and it looks great.  I highly recommend it but I also have metal door frames so I don't know if this would dent the wood in a regular door frame.  Though I think a small dent would be better than a screw hole...",5
